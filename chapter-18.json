Introduction to Neurologic Emergencies\nneurologic emergencies include strokes, seizures, headaches, and altered\nmental status [2].\nUnderstanding the nervous system is important [2].\nStroke is a major cause of death and disability [3].\nNew treatments are available for stroke [5].\nSeizures and altered mental status can indicate brain disorders [6].\n2. Anatomy and Physiology of the Nervous System\nThe brain controls body functions like breathing and speech [11].\nThere are three main brain parts: the brain stem, cerebellum, and cerebrum\n[13].\nThe cerebrum is the largest part [14].\nThe brain stem manages basic functions like breathing and blood pressure [15]\n.\nThe cerebellum coordinates muscle and body movements [15].\nMessages travel through nerves and the spinal cord [21].\nBrain Part Location Functions\nBrain Stem Located below the\ncerebrum\nBlood pressure, breathing, swallowing,\npupil size\nCerebellum Located below the\ncerebrum\nMuscle and body coordination\nCerebrum Largest part, above\ncerebellum\nEmotion, thought, sensation, movement,\nsight, speech\n3. Common Neurologic Conditions: Headaches\nHeadaches are a frequent complaint [30].\nThey can be a symptom or a condition itself [31].\nMost headaches are not caused by serious issues [32].\ntension headaches are caused by muscle contractions from stress [34].\nmigraine headaches involve changes in blood vessels [36].\nMigraines can cause pounding pain, nausea, and visual changes [37].\nsinus headaches result from fluid in sinus cavities [40].\nSerious conditions like hemorrhagic stroke or brain tumors can cause\nheadaches [42].\nHeadache Type Cause Pain\nDescription\nAssociated\nSymptoms\nEmergency\nCare\nNeeded\nTension Muscle\ncontractions\n(stress)\nSqueezing,\ndull, ache\nUsually none Usually no\nMigraine Blood vessel\nsize changes\nPounding,\nthrobbing,\npulsating\nNausea,\nvomiting, visual\nwarning signs\nYes\nSinus Fluid in sinus\ncavities\nPressure Nasal\ncongestion,\ncough, fever\n(cold-like)\nUsually no\nSerious (e.g.,\nHemorrhagic\nStroke, Brain\nTumor,\nMeningitis)\nVarious,\nserious\nconditions\nSevere Varies, can\ninclude fever,\nseizures,\naltered mental\nstatus\nYes\n4. Common Neurologic Conditions: Stroke (CVA)\nA stroke is when blood flow to the brain is interrupted [43].\nThis interruption causes loss of brain function [43].\nThere are two types of stroke: ischemic and hemorrhagic [44].\nischemic stroke is most common, accounting for 87% [45].\nischemic strokes are caused by a thrombus or emboli [47].\natherosclerosis often causes ischemic strokes [48].\nhemorrhagic stroke accounts for 13% of strokes [48].\nhemorrhagic strokes result from bleeding in the brain [49].\nHigh blood pressure increases the risk of hemorrhagic stroke [50].\nTIAs (transient ischemic attacks) are temporary stroke symptoms [52].\nTIAs are warning signs for a larger stroke [53].\nStroke Type Cause Percentage of\nStrokes\nDescription\nIschemic Thrombus or\nemboli\n87% Blood flow blocked by a clot\nHemorrhagic Bleeding inside\nthe brain\n13% Blood vessel ruptures and\nbleeds into brain tissue\n5. Signs and Symptoms of Stroke\nGeneral stroke signs include facial drooping [56].\nSudden weakness or numbness on one side is common [56].\nDecreased movement or sensation can occur [57].\nLack of coordination or balance may be present [57].\nVision problems like sudden loss or double vision can happen [57].\nDifficulty swallowing may occur [58].\nPatients may have a decreased level of responsiveness [58].\nSpeech disorders, including aphasia, are possible [58].\naphasia is difficulty speaking or understanding words [58].\nSlurred speech can be a symptom [58].\nSudden and severe headache can occur [58].\nConfusion or dizziness may be present [58].\nWeakness, combativeness, or restlessness can happen [58].\nTongue deviation is a possible sign [58].\nComa can occur [58].\nLeft hemisphere strokes may cause aphasia and right-side paralysis [59].\nRight hemisphere strokes may cause left-side paralysis [62].\nPatients with right hemisphere strokes may neglect problems or lack pain\nsensation [62].\n6. Conditions Mimicking Stroke and Intracranial Bleeding\nSome conditions can look like a stroke [64].\nHypoglycemia (low blood sugar) can mimic stroke [64].\nThe post-ictal state after a seizure can also look like stroke [64].\nSubdural or epidural bleeding can present similarly [64].\nTrauma to the head can cause intracranial bleeding [66].\nEpidural bleeding is outside the dura and under the skull [66].\nSubdural bleeding is beneath the dura but outside the brain [66].\nCondition Mimicking Stroke Description\nHypoglycemia Low blood sugar levels\nPostictal State The state immediately following a seizure\nSubdural Bleeding Bleeding beneath the dura, outside the brain\nEpidural Bleeding Bleeding outside the dura and under the skull\n7. Common Neurologic Conditions: Seizures\nA seizure is a neurologic event from abnormal electrical brain activity [67].\nEpilepsy affects 3.5 million people in the US [67].\nSeizures fall into two groups: generalized and partial [68].\nPartial seizures are also called focal seizures [69].\nGeneralized seizures, or tonic-clonic seizures, affect both brain hemispheres\n[70].\nThey involve unconsciousness and severe muscle twitching [70].\nGeneralized seizures typically last several minutes [70].\nAbsence seizures involve brief loss of consciousness without motor changes\n[71].\nFocal seizures can have impaired awareness [73].\nFocal seizures may cause numbness, weakness, or visual problems [74].\nThey can also cause twitching or brief paralysis [74].\nFocal seizures with impaired awareness affect the patient's interaction with\nthe environment [75].\nLip smacking, eye blinking, or jerking may occur [76].\nPatients may smell unusual odors or see hallucinations [77].\nAn aura is a warning sign before a seizure [78].\nAuras can include visual changes or hallucinations [78].\nNot all seizures are preceded by an aura [80].\nstatus epilepticus is a seizure lasting over five minutes or recurring without\nregaining consciousness [84].\nSeizure\nGroup\nType Description Consciousness\nAffected\nMotor\nActivity\nGeneralized Tonic-Clonic Abnormal\nelectrical\ndischarges in both\nhemispheres\nYes Severe\nmuscle\ntwitching\nGeneralized Absence Brief lapse of\nconsciousness,\nseems to stare\nYes No change\nPartial/Focal Focal\n(Aware)\nAbnormal\ndischarges from\ntemporal lobe\nNo Twitching,\nbrief\nparalysis\nPartial/Focal Focal\n(Impaired\nAwareness)\nAltered mental\nstatus, does not\ninteract normally\nwith environment\nYes Varies\n8. Causes and Management of Seizures\nCommon seizure causes include congenital, metabolic, or febrile conditions\n[86].\nEpileptic seizures are often controlled with medication [87].\nMedications include Keppra, Dilantin, and phenobarbital [88].\nRecognizing a seizure and the post-ictal state is important [89].\nThe post-ictal state occurs after the seizure stops [90].\nMuscles relax and breathing may be labored during the post-ictal state [90].\nWeakness on one side (hemiparesis) can resemble a stroke [90].\nLethargy and confusion are common in the post-ictal state [91].\nSeizures can be mistaken for syncope (fainting) [92].\nFainting typically happens when standing and lacks a post-ictal state [92].\nProlonged or recurring seizures are life-threatening [85].\n9. Common Neurologic Conditions: Altered Mental Status\nAltered mental status is a common neurologic emergency besides stroke and\nseizure [93].\nMany things can cause altered mental status [94].\nCauses include hypoglycemia (low sugar) and hypoxia [94].\nIntoxication and delirium are possible causes [94].\nDrug overdose can lead to altered mental status [94].\nAn unrecognized head injury can be a cause [94].\nBrain infection or tumors can cause it [94].\nBody temperature abnormalities may lead to altered mental status [94].\nPoisoning is also a possible cause [94].\nCauses of Altered Mental Status\nHypoglycemia (Low blood sugar)\nHypoxia\nIntoxication\nDelirium\nDrug overdose\nUnrecognized head injury\nBrain infection\nBody temperature abnormalities\nBrain tumor\nPoisoning\n10. Patient Assessment in Neurologic Emergencies\nPatient assessment starts with scene size-up [96].\nDetermine if it's a medical or trauma situation [96].\nPerform a rapid primary assessment for life threats [98].\nGather history from family or bystanders if the patient is unresponsive [99].\nLook for clues explaining altered mental status [99].\nObtain vital signs, including blood glucose levels [102].\nHigh blood pressure or erratic respirations can indicate intracranial pressure\n[102].\nUnequal pupil size suggests pressure in the brain [104].\nStroke assessment scales are used [107].\nBE FAST is a stroke mnemonic [108].\nThe Cincinnati and Los Angeles Pre-hospital Stroke Scales are common [109].\nThe glasgow coma scale (GCS) assesses neurologic status [111].\nThe GCS includes eye opening, verbal response, and motor response [117].\nGCS scores range from 3 to 15 [118].\nAssessment Scale Components\nBE FAST Mnemonic Balance, Eyes, Facial droop, Arm drift, Speech,\nTime\nCincinnati Pre-hospital Stroke\nScale\nFacial droop, Arm drift, Speech\nLos Angeles Pre-hospital Stroke\nScreen\nVarious criteria assessing stroke probability\nThree-Item Stroke Severity Scale LAG\nLos Angeles Motor Scale LAMS\nGlasgow Coma Scale (GCS) Eye opening, Best verbal response, Best motor\nresponse\n11. Reassessment and Treatment Principles\nReassessment includes checking ABCs and vital signs [119].\nCompare current findings to the initial assessment [120].\nWatch for changes in pulse, blood pressure, respirations, and GCS score [121].\nNotify the hospital of the patient's condition [121].\nFor suspected stroke, doctors need to check for bleeding [122].\nClot-dissolving medicine may be given if no bleeding is present [123].\nNotify the hospital about the last normal time for a stroke patient [124].\nSeizure patients need hospital evaluation [125].\nProtect seizing patients from harm [126].\nMaintain an open airway and provide oxygen for seizures [126].\nConsider spinal immobilization for head or neck trauma [126].\nFor status epilepticus, provide ventilations and transport quickly [127].\nSudden severe headaches, especially with fever or altered mental status, are\nconcerning [128].\nFor migraines, assess for serious conditions [129].\nProvide high-flow oxygen if tolerated for migraines [130].\nKeep the environment dark and quiet for migraine transport [131].\nAvoid using sirens or lights during migraine transport [131].\nFor stroke care, support ABCs and transport to a stroke center [132].\nMaintain oxygen saturation of at least 94% [133].\nFibrinolytic therapy can reverse stroke symptoms if given early [135].\nFor seizures, assess and treat ABCs [136].\nProtect seizing patients from harm [137].\nFor altered mental status, determine the cause [138].\nSpinal immobilization and airway support may be needed [138].\nTransport patients to the correct facility [139].\n12. Review Questions and Key Takeaways\nDysfunction causing slow pulse, irregular breathing, and dilated pupils likely\nindicates brain stem issues [142]. The brain stem controls these basic\nfunctions [145].\nAn acute ischemic stroke is caused by a blocked cerebral artery [146]. This\nblock is from a thrombus or emboli [147].\nSudden severe headache with high blood pressure and unresponsiveness\nsuggests a hemorrhagic stroke [148]. This is often due to a ruptured cerebral\nartery [151].\nTIA symptoms resolve within 24 hours, unlike some ischemic stroke\nsymptoms [151].\nSlurred speech difficult to understand is called dysarthria [152].\nSevere twitching of all muscles lasting minutes or longer is a generalized\nseizure [154].\nPrompt transport for stroke patients is crucial for potential clot-busting\nmedication [156].\nThe cincinnati pre-hospital stroke scale includes facial symmetry, arm drift,\nand speech assessment [157].\nA patient opening eyes to name, making incomprehensible sounds, and\nwithdrawing from pain has a GCS of 9 [158].\nPatients with severe migraines should be transported without lights and\nsirens [160]. Oxygen can be given if tolerated [162].",
