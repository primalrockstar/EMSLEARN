# Module 8: Neurologic, Gastrointestinal & Hematologic Emergencies

---

## Chapter 18: Neurologic Emergencies

### Overview
Discusses stroke, seizure, syncope, and other neurological emergencies, including recognition and prehospital management.

### Learning Objectives
- Identify signs of stroke and seizure.
- Implement rapid assessment and transport for neurologic emergencies.
- Understand basic pathophysiology.

### Key Terms
| Term   | Definition |
|--------|------------|
| CVA    | Cerebrovascular Accident (stroke). |
| TIA    | Transient Ischemic Attack. |
| Postictal | State after a seizure. |

### Major Concepts & Guidelines
- Stroke: sudden loss of neuro function, time critical.
- Seizure: abnormal electrical brain activity.
- Use FAST or Cincinnati Stroke Scale for assessment.

### Procedures / Protocols
- **Stroke:**  
  - Rapid assessment, oxygen, transport to stroke center.
- **Seizure:**  
  - Protect airway, prevent injury, monitor for postictal state.

### Assessment & Clinical Pearls
- Document onset time for stroke.
- Prolonged seizure (>5 min) is status epilepticus—life threatening.

### Documentation Standards
- Record neuro findings, onset, duration, interventions.

### Case Example
> Elderly patient with slurred speech and right arm weakness. What assessments and actions should EMS take?

### Quick Reference Table
| Symptom   | Possible Cause  | Action        |
|-----------|-----------------|--------------|
| Unilateral weakness | Stroke | FAST, transport |

### Review Questions
1. What is the difference between TIA and CVA?
2. What is the postictal state?
3. Why is onset time important in stroke?

## Chapter 19: Gastrointestinal and Urologic Emergencies

### Overview
Covers abdominal pain, GI bleeding, urologic complaints, and their prehospital assessment and management.

### Learning Objectives
- Identify common causes of abdominal pain.
- Assess for signs of GI bleeding and shock.
- Provide supportive care and rapid transport.

### Key Terms
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Hematemesis | Vomiting blood. |
| Melena | Black/tarry stool (GI bleeding). |
| Peritonitis | Inflammation of abdominal lining. |

### Major Concepts & Guidelines
- Abdominal pain may be visceral, parietal, or referred.
- GI bleeding can present with shock—monitor closely.

### Procedures / Protocols
- **GI Bleed:**  
  - Oxygen, shock management, rapid transport.
- **Pain Assessment:**  
  - OPQRST, abdominal exam.

### Assessment & Clinical Pearls
- Pain out of proportion may indicate ischemia.
- Elderly may have atypical presentations.

### Documentation Standards
- Record location, severity, associated symptoms.

### Case Example
> Patient with severe RUQ pain and vomiting blood. What are possible causes and EMS priorities?

### Quick Reference Table
| Symptom   | Possible Cause | Action        |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|
| Melena    | GI bleed      | Shock management |

### Review Questions
1. What is hematemesis?
2. Name two signs of GI bleeding.
3. How is shock managed in GI emergencies?

## Chapter 20: Endocrine and Hematologic Emergencies

### Overview
Explores emergencies related to diabetes, sickle cell disease, and other endocrine/hematologic disorders.

### Learning Objectives
- Recognize signs of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia.
- Assess and treat sickle cell crisis.
- Understand basic endocrine and hematologic pathophysiology.

### Key Terms
| Term      | Definition |
|-----------|------------|
| Hypoglycemia | Low blood glucose. |
| Hyperglycemia | High blood glucose. |
| Sickle Cell Crisis | Acute complication of sickle cell anemia. |

### Major Concepts & Guidelines
- Hypoglycemia presents with AMS, diaphoresis, tachycardia.
- Hyperglycemia may cause dehydration, AMS, Kussmaul respirations.
- Sickle cell crisis: severe pain, risk of stroke/infection.

### Procedures / Protocols
- **Diabetes:**  
  - Check glucose, treat with oral glucose if indicated.
- **Sickle Cell:**  
  - Oxygen, pain management, rapid transport.

### Assessment & Clinical Pearls
- Repeat glucose if AMS persists.
- Look for signs of infection in sickle cell.

### Documentation Standards
- Record glucose readings, interventions, and response.

### Case Example
> Diabetic patient is confused and sweating. What is likely, and how should EMS proceed?

### Quick Reference Table
| Symptom     | Possible Cause   | Treatment      |
|-------------|------------------|---------------|
| AMS + low glucose | Hypoglycemia | Oral glucose  |

### Review Questions
1. What are early signs of hypoglycemia?
2. How is sickle cell crisis managed?
3. What are Kussmaul respirations?
