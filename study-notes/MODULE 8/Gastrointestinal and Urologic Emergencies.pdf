1. Introduction to Gastrointestinal and Urologic Emergencies
This chapter covers gastrointestinal and urologic emergencies for EMTs [1].
It is important to understand the anatomy and physiology of these systems [2]
.
EMTs will assess and manage patients with various abdominal complaints [3].
These complaints include abdominal pain, hypoglycemia, and
hyperglycemia [3].
They also include shock related to acute or chronic gastrointestinal
disorders [3].
Hemorrhage, peritonitis, and renal system complications are also covered
[3].
You do not need to determine the exact cause of abdominal pain [7].
Recognize life-threatening problems and act quickly [8].
Rapid assessment and emotional support are needed for anxious patients in
pain [9].
2. Anatomy and Physiology of the Abdominal Cavity
The abdominal cavity holds solid and hollow organs [9].
These organs belong to three systems: gastrointestinal, genital, and urinary
[10].
Solid organ injury can cause shock and bleeding [11].
If a hollow organ perforates, contents leak and contaminate the abdominal
cavity [12].
System Solid Organs Hollow Organs
Gastrointestinal Liver, Pancreas,
Spleen [18]
Stomach, Gallbladder, Small Intestines, Colon
[15]
Genital Testicles,
Ovaries [28]
Epididymis, Vas deferentia, Seminal vesicles,
Prostate gland, Penis, Fallopian tubes,
Uterus, Cervix, Vagina [28]
Urinary Kidneys [31] Ureters, Bladder, Urethra [31]
The gastrointestinal system is for digestion [14].
Digestion starts in the mouth [15].
The stomach breaks down food with gastric juices [15].
The liver helps digestion by secreting bile [17].
It filters toxic substances and produces blood clotting factors [18].
The gallbladder stores bile [19].
Food goes to the small intestines with three sections [20].
The duodenum mixes digestive juices from the pancreas and liver [21].
The pancreas secretes enzymes for starches, fats, and proteins [22].
The jejunum absorbs digestive products [23].
The ileum absorbs later nutrients and bile acids [25].
The colon (large intestines) absorbs water and forms stool [26].
The spleen is in the abdomen but has no digestive function [27].
The abdominal space also contains reproductive organs [27].
Male organs include testicles and penis [28].
Female organs include ovaries and uterus [29].
The urinary system controls waste discharge filtered by the kidneys [30].
There are two kidneys, one on each side [32].
Ureters connect kidneys to the bladder [33].
The urinary bladder is behind the pubic bone [34].
The bladder empties through the urethra [34].
Adults normally form 1.5 to 2 liters of urine daily [35].
3. Pathophysiology of Abdominal Conditions
The peritoneum is a membrane lining the abdominal cavity and covering
organs [38].
The parietal peritoneum lines the cavity walls [40].
The visceral peritoneum covers the organs [40].
Foreign material like blood or pus irritates the peritoneum [41].
This irritation causes peritonitis [41].
Acute abdomen is sudden abdominal pain [42].
It often needs medical attention [43].
Peritonitis can cause ileus, paralysis of intestinal contractions [43].
Ileus leads to retained gas and feces, causing distension [43].
The stomach empties by vomiting [43].
Diverticulitis is inflammation of small pockets in muscle walls [44].
Cholecystitis is gallbladder inflammation [44].
Acute appendicitis is inflammation of the appendix [44].
Cause of Acute
Abdomen
Signs and Symptoms
Ulcers [49] Gnawing stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, belching,
heartburn [50]
Gallstones [52] Severe pain in upper right or mid-abdomen, nausea,
vomiting, indigestion [54]
Pancreatitis [55] Severe pain in upper quadrants radiating to back, nausea,
vomiting, distension [56]
Appendicitis [58] Initial dull pain near naval, later radiating to right lower
quadrant, nausea [59]
GI Hemorrhage [63] Vomiting blood (upper GI), bright red stools (lower GI) [65]
The parietal peritoneum has nerves like skin nerves [46].
This helps identify localized pain [46].
The visceral peritoneum is supplied by the autonomic nervous system [47].
These nerves are less able to localize pain [47].
Referred pain results from nervous system connections [48].
Common causes of acute abdomen include ulcers [49].
Ulcers are erosion of the protective lining [49].
Most are caused by infection or NSAID use [50].
Complications include hematemesis, melena, or peritonitis [51].
Gallstones can block the gallbladder outlet [52].
This can cause gallbladder inflammation [53].
Pancreatitis can be caused by gallstones or alcohol abuse [55].
Complications include sepsis and hemorrhage [57].
Appendicitis is inflammation or infection of the appendix [58].
Signs include dull umbilical pain radiating to the right lower quadrant [59].
Nausea, vomiting, fever, and chills may be present [60].
Rebound tenderness can occur [61].
Complications include abscesses, peritonitis, or shock [62].
Gastrointestinal hemorrhage is a symptom of other diseases [63].
It can be acute or chronic [63].
It occurs in the upper or lower GI tract [63].
Upper causes include esophageal varices or Mallory-Weiss tear [64].
Lower causes include inflammation, diverticulitis, cancer, or hemorrhoids
[64].
Esophagitis is inflammation of the esophagus lining [66].
GERD is a common cause [67].
Symptoms include pain swallowing and heartburn [67].
Esophageal varices are increased pressure in blood vessels near the
esophagus [68].
This is often due to liver failure [68].
Alcohol or viral hepatitis are common causes [69].
Patients may show signs of liver disease [70].
Rupture is sudden with vomiting bright red blood, hypotension, and shock
signs [71].
Complication is significant blood loss [72].
Mallory-Weiss syndrome is a tear at the esophagus-stomach junction [73].
Violent coughing or vomiting is a cause [73].
Symptoms include shock, upper abdominal pain, hematemesis, and
melena [73].
Gastroenteritis is infection with diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting [73].
Non-infectious conditions can also cause it [73].
Symptoms include diarrhea, cramping, nausea, vomiting, and fever [73].
Complications include dehydration and shock [73].
Diverticulitis is due to a lack of fiber causing hard stools [74].
This increases pressure and causes bulges in the colon walls [75].
Fecal matter gets caught, leading to inflammation and infection [76].
Pain is often in the left lower quadrant [77].
Complications include perforation and shock [78].
Hemorrhoids are swollen blood vessels around the rectum [79].
Increased pressure in the rectum is a common cause [80].
Signs are painless, bright red bleeding during defecation [81].
4. Urinary System Emergencies
Cystitis is bladder inflammation, often a UTI [83].
Bacterial infection is a common cause [84].
Symptoms include midline lower abdominal pain and blood in the urine [85].
Urgency, frequency, pressure, and pain around the bladder occur [85].
Complications include kidney infections [85].
The kidneys maintain homeostasis [87].
Uremia results when kidneys fail [87].
Kidney stones can cause blockages [88].
Acute kidney failure is a sudden decrease in function [89].
Causes include hemorrhage, dehydration, trauma, and shock [89].
Sepsis, heart failure, medications, and drug abuse can cause it [90].
Kidney stones are also a cause [90].
It may be reversible with prompt treatment [90].
Chronic kidney failure is progressive and irreversible damage [91].
Common causes are diabetes and hypertension [92].
Symptoms include lethargy, nausea, headaches, and cramps [93].
Anemia, seizures, and coma occur later [93].
Dialysis is eventually required [93].
These patients have an increased risk of heart failure and cardiac arrest
[94].
For end-stage renal disease, dialysis is the definitive treatment [131].
Dialysis filters blood and removes toxins [132].
Missing treatment can lead to weakness and pulmonary edema [133].
Dialysis machines function like normal kidneys [135].
Patients undergoing long-term hemodialysis have a shunt connecting a vein
and artery [135].
This shunt allows blood to flow to the dialysis machine [136].
Peritoneal dialysis infuses fluid into the abdominal cavity [137].
The fluid stays for one to two hours [138].
It carries a high risk of peritonitis [138].
Adverse effects of dialysis include hypotension and dysrhythmias [139].
Chest pain, muscle cramps, nausea, and vomiting can occur [139].
Hemorrhage from the access site is possible [139].
Infection can occur at the access site [140].
Management of dialysis patients includes ABCs [140].
Provide high flow oxygen if needed [140].
Manage bleeding from the access site [140].
Position the patient sitting up for pulmonary edema or supine for shock
[140].
Prompt transport is important [140].
Dialysis patients may have urinary catheters [141].
Catheters can be a site of infection [141].
5. Other Abdominal Emergencies
Gynecologic problems are a common cause of acute abdominal pain [95].
Lower quadrant pain may be related to the ovaries, fallopian tubes, or uterus
[97].
The aorta lies behind the peritoneum [99].
Weak areas can form an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) [99].
Condition Description Signs/Symptoms
(General)

Aortic
Aneurysm
(AAA) [99]
Weak area in the
aorta behind the
peritoneum [99]

[103]
May not have a
noticeable mass [106]
No longer

AAA is difficult to detect [100].
Signs can include back pain with a tearing sensation [101].
Use extreme caution when assessing for AAA [101].
If an aneurysm tears or ruptures, massive hemorrhage can occur [102].
A hernia is a protrusion of an organ or tissue [103].
It goes through a hole or opening into another body cavity [104].
Causes include congenital defects or weak areas like the groin [105].
Reducible hernias can be pushed back and pose little risk [107].
Strangulation is a serious injury [108].
Blood supply is compromised by compressed tissues [108].
Signs include a mass that is no longer reducible [109].
Pain and tenderness at the hernia site occur [110].
Red or blue skin discoloration over the hernia indicates strangulation [110].
6. Patient Assessment for Abdominal Emergencies
Patient assessment starts with scene size-up [112].
Use standard precautions [112].
Determine the mechanism of injury or nature of illness [113].
Acute abdomen can result from trauma [113].
Develop suspicion for life threats based on assessment [113].
Primary assessment's priority is to identify and treat life threats [114].
Form a general impression [115].
Assess ABCs and Ds [115].
Airway and breathing may be shallow due to pain [115].
Assess for major bleeding during circulation assessment [116].
Ask about blood in vomit or stools [116].
Pulse rate and skin condition indicate shock [117].
Check pulses in both feet [117].
Different pulse strengths may indicate aortic dissection [118].
Immediate transport is needed for signs of significant illness [119].
Take a SAMPLE history [120].
Ask about nausea, vomiting, and bowel changes [120].
Ask about urination, weight loss, or belching [120].
Ask about pain, other symptoms, or chest pain [120].
Secondary assessment includes patient positioning [121].
Positioning may give clues about the illness [121].
The physical exam involves assessing the abdomen [121].
A normal abdomen is soft and not tender [121].
Pain and tenderness are common symptoms [122].
Localized pain can indicate the problem [122].
Abdominal muscles may be rigid (guarding) [123].
Take vital signs [124].
High respiratory rate with normal pulse/BP may mean improper ventilation
[125].
High respiratory rate and pulse with shock signs may indicate septic or
hypovolemic shock [126].
Avoid blood pressure in an arm with a dialysis shunt [126].
Frequent reassessments are important [127].
Assess interventions like shock treatment [127].
Provide emotional support [127].
Transport in a comfortable position [127].
Consider advanced life support [128].
Communication and documentation are important [128].
7. Emergency Care and Management
You cannot treat the causes of pain, but you can provide comfort [128].
Lessen the effects of shock [128].
Treat for shock even without obvious signs [128].
Position vomiting patients to maintain their airway [129].
Contain vomit to prevent infectious disease spread [129].
Use biohazard bags [129].
Wear gloves, eye protection, gown, and mask [129].
Clean the ambulance and equipment after patient release [130].
Wash your hands even after wearing gloves [130].
Provide low flow oxygen [130].
This may decrease nausea and anxiety [130].
