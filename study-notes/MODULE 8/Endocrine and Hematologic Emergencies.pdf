1. Introduction to Endocrine and Hematologic Emergencies
This report covers endocrine and hematologic emergencies from Chapter
20 [1].
Understanding these conditions is crucial for emergency care and
transportation of the sick and injured [1].
The report aims to explain the significance and characteristics of diabetes,
sickle cell disease, and clotting disorders [2].
It will also detail the assessment and pre-hospital treatment for these
emergencies [4].
The endocrine system profoundly influences nearly every cell, organ, and
function of the body [6].
endocrine disorders often present with a variety of signs and symptoms [6].
hematologic emergencies can be challenging to assess and treat in the prehospital
setting [7].
2. Anatomy and Physiology of the Endocrine System and Glucose
Metabolism
The endocrine system serves as a communication system within the body [8]
.
endocrine glands secrete messenger hormones that travel through the blood
[8].
These hormones affect specific target organs, tissues, or cells [8].
endocrine disorders arise from internal communication problems [9].
A gland may overproduce hormones (hypersecretion) or underproduce
them (hyposecretion) [10].
Sometimes the gland functions correctly, but the receiving organ does not
respond [11].
Glucose metabolism is vital, as the brain needs glucose and oxygen to
survive [11].
insulin is necessary for glucose to enter cells [12].
insulin acts like a key unlocking the door for glucose [13].
Without sufficient insulin, cells do not receive energy [14].
The pancreas produces and stores two key hormones: glucagon and insulin
[15].
The islets of Langerhans in the pancreas contain alpha and beta cells [16].
Alpha cells produce glucagon [18].
Beta cells produce insulin [18].
The pancreas secretes insulin and glucagon based on blood glucose levels
[19].

3. Diabetes Mellitus: Pathophysiology, Types, and Complications
Diabetes mellitus is a disorder of glucose metabolism [19].
The body has an impaired ability to get glucose into cells for energy [19].
Untreated diabetes leads to high blood glucose levels [20].
Severe cases can cause life-threatening illness, coma, or death [21].
Poorly managed diabetes can lead to severe complications [22].
These include blindness, cardiovascular disease, and kidney failure [22].
There are three main types of diabetes [23].
diabetes mellitus type 1 [23].
diabetes mellitus type 2 [23].
gestational diabetes (pregnancy-induced) [23].
Diabetes treatments involve medications and injectable hormones [24].
These treatments lower blood glucose levels [24].
Incorrect administration can create a medical emergency [24].
hypoglycemia (low blood glucose) is life-threatening if untreated [25].
hyperglycemia (high blood glucose) can result in coma or death [26].
Excessive treatment (e.g., too much insulin) can cause life-threatening
hypoglycemia [26].
Both hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia can occur in Type 1 and Type 2
diabetes [27].
Patients often display signs and symptoms of high and low blood glucose [28].
hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia can have similar presentations [29].
Patients may have altered mental status and mimic alcohol intoxication [30].

4. Hypoglycemia: Causes, Signs, Symptoms, and Management
hypoglycemia is low blood sugar [31].
It can develop if a person takes medication but doesn't eat enough food [32].
Taking too much medication can also result in low blood glucose levels [32].
Common reasons for low blood sugar include:
Correct insulin dose with a change in routine or more insulin than normal
[75].
Correct insulin dose without the patient eating [75].
Correct insulin dose and the patient developing an acute illness [75].
All hypoglycemic patients require prompt transport [32].
Signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia include:
Normal to shallow or rapid respirations [75].
Pale, moist skin; diaphoresis [75].
Dizziness, headache [75].
Rapid pulse or normal to low blood pressure [75].
Altered mental status [75].
Anxious or combative behavior [75].
Seizures, fainting, or coma [75].
Weakness on one side of the body (may mimic a stroke) [75].
Rapid changes in mental status [75].
hypoglycemia is quickly reversed by giving the patient glucose [76].
Without glucose, the patient can sustain permanent brain damage [77].
5. Diabetes Mellitus Type 1: Characteristics and Diabetic
Ketoacidosis (DKA)
diabetes mellitus type 1 is an autoimmune disorder [34].
The immune system attacks pancreatic beta cells that produce insulin [34].
Missing insulin means glucose cannot enter cells [34].
The pancreas does not produce its own insulin in Type 1 diabetes [34].
Onset usually occurs from early childhood through the fourth decade [35].
Patients with Type 1 diabetes cannot survive without external insulin [35].
Many patients use an implanted insulin pump [36].
These pumps continuously measure glucose and provide insulin [37].
They can malfunction, leading to diabetic emergencies [39].
Always ask about the presence of an insulin pump [39].
Type 1 diabetes is the most common metabolic disease of childhood [40].
New onset Type 1 diabetes symptoms relate to eating and drinking [41].
polyuria (increased urination) [41].
polydipsia (increased thirst) [41].
polyphagia (increased hunger) [41].
Weight loss and fatigue [41].
Normal blood glucose is between 80 and 120 mg/dL [42].
When blood glucose is high, the kidneys' filtration system is overwhelmed [43].
Glucose then spills into the urine [43].
If glucose is unavailable, the body burns fat for energy [44].
Burning fat produces acid waste called ketones [44].
Ketone levels rise in the blood and spill into the urine [45].
Kidneys cannot maintain acid-base balance with high glucose and ketones
[46].
Patients breathe faster and deeper to release carbon dioxide and reduce acid
[47].
This breathing pattern is known as kussmaul respirations [47].
Continued fat metabolism and ketone production can cause diabetic
ketoacidosis (dka) [48].
DKA is a life-threatening illness [48].
DKA may present as generalized illness [49].
Symptoms include abdominal pain, body aches, nausea, and vomiting [50].
Altered mental status or unconsciousness can occur in severe DKA [50].
DKA can result in death if not rapidly recognized and treated [51].
Blood glucose in DKA is generally higher than 400 mg/dL [52].

6. Diabetes Mellitus Type 2: Characteristics and Hyperosmolar
Hyperglycemic Nonketotic Syndrome (HHNS)
diabetes mellitus type 2 is caused by cellular resistance to insulin [53].
Obesity predisposes patients to Type 2 diabetes [54].
The pancreas produces insulin, but cells and receptors are dysfunctional [55].
insulin resistance can improve with exercise and dietary modification [56].
Treatment includes oral medications [57].
Some increase insulin secretion, posing a hypoglycemia risk [57].
Others stimulate insulin receptors or decrease glucagon effects [57].
Injectable medications and insulin are also used for Type 2 diabetes [58].
Type 2 diabetes is often diagnosed at a yearly medical exam [58].
Complaints relate to high blood glucose levels [58].
These include recurrent infections, vision changes, or foot numbness [59].
Symptomatic hyperglycemia occurs with very high blood glucose [60].
Patients have altered mental status due to combined problems [60].
Contrast with Type 1 diabetes:
Type 1 leads to ketoacidosis and dehydration from urination [62].
Type 2 leads to a non-ketotic state of dehydration [63].
Fluid is discharged from body systems and kidneys, causing imbalance [63]
.
Long-term hyperglycemia can cause complications [64].
Wounds that don't heal, numbness in hands/feet, blindness, renal failure
[64].
Gastric motility problems [64].
Uncontrolled Type 2 diabetes can lead to hyperosmolar hyperglycemic
nonketotic syndrome (hhns) [65].
HHNS key signs and symptoms include:
hyperglycemia [65].
Altered mental status, drowsiness, lethargy [65].
Severe dehydration, thirst, dark urine [65].
Visual and sensory defects, partial paralysis, muscle weakness [66].
Seizures [66].
High blood glucose causes glucose excretion into urine [66].
Patients increase fluid intake, causing polyuria [66].
In HHNS, patients cannot drink enough to keep up with high glucose levels [67]
.
Urine becomes dark and concentrated [68].
Severe dehydration can lead to unconsciousness or seizure activity [69].
7. Patient Assessment for Diabetic Emergencies
Begin with scene size-up [78].
Be cautious of syringes used for insulin [78].
Look for clues like syringes, insulin bottles, food, or orange juice [79].
Use standard precautions [80].
Question bystanders about events leading to your arrival [80].
Consider that trauma may also have occurred [80].
Determine the mechanism of injury (MOI) or nature of illness (NOI) [81].
Perform a primary assessment [82].
Get a general impression of the patient [82].
Identify threats and provide life-saving interventions, especially airway
management [83].
Determine the level of consciousness using the AVPU scale (Alert, Verbal,
Painful, Unresponsive) [84].
If unresponsive and you suspect diabetes, call for Advanced Life Support
(ALS) [85].
Patients may have undiagnosed diabetes [85].
Assess blood glucose levels in patients with altered mental status [85].
Perform cervical spine immobilization if necessary [86].
Provide rapid transport [86].
Assess the patient's breathing [87].
Patients with inadequate breathing, a pulse ox less than 94, or altered mental
status need high flow oxygen (12-15 L/min via non-rebreather) [88].
Hyperglycemic patients may have rapid, deep (Kussmaul) respirations and
sweet, fruity breath [89].
Hypoglycemic patients may have normal, shallow, or rapid respirations [90].
If the patient isn't breathing well, open the airway, insert an adjunct,
administer oxygen, and assist ventilations [91].
Monitor ventilations throughout care [91].
Assess circulation (the "C") [92].
Hyperglycemic patients often have dry, warm skin [92].
Hypoglycemic patients often have moist, pale skin [92].
A rapid, weak pulse can indicate symptomatic hypoglycemia [93].
Make a transport decision (the "D") [94].
Transport patients with altered mental status and impaired swallowing [95].
Conscious patients who can swallow may be evaluated on scene [96].
Perform history taking [97].
Investigate the chief complaint and obtain the history of the present illness
using OPQRST [97].
Obtain the patient's history [97].
If the patient ate but didn't take insulin, hyperglycemia is more likely [97].
Obtain a SAMPLE history [98].
For known diabetics, ask about insulin/pills, insulin pump use, insulin/pill dose
taken, food intake, illness, unusual activity, or stress [99].
Look for emergency medical identification tags (wallet card, necklace,
bracelet) [99].
Conduct a secondary assessment [100].
For nature of illness, focus on a neurological assessment [100].
Assess non-responsive patients head-to-toe for clues and secondary injuries
like trauma [100].
When diabetes is suspected, focus on mental status, ability to swallow, and
airway protection [100].
Obtain a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score [100].
Obtain vital signs, including blood glucose level if possible [100].
hypoglycemia vital signs: normal to rapid respirations, weak and rapid pulse,
pale and clammy skin, low blood sugar [101].
hyperglycemia vital signs: rapid (maybe deep and rapid) respirations, rapid,
weak, thready pulse, warm and dry skin, normal blood pressure [102].
Use a portable glucometer if available and protocol allows [103].
Know the glucometer's operating ranges [104].
Normal non-fasting adult/child blood glucose: 80-120 mg/dL [104].
Neonate glucose should be above 70 mg/dL [104].

8. Emergency Medical Care for Diabetic Emergencies
Reassess diabetic patients frequently [105].
Assess changes in mental status and ABCs [106].
Evaluate response to interventions [106].
Adjust interventions based on glucose administration, readings, or
deteriorating consciousness [106].
For conscious hypoglycemic patients who can swallow [107]:
Encourage glucose tablets or juice containing sugar [107].
Use glucose gel or sugar drink if local protocol allows [108].
Provide rapid transport for unconscious hypoglycemic patients [109].
Also transport patients with risk of aspiration (cannot maintain airway) [109].
These patients may need IV glucose, IM shot, or intranasal glucagon [110].
Most EMTs cannot give glucagon [111].
If unsure if the patient is hyperglycemic or hypoglycemic, err on the side of
giving sugar [112].
Determining blood glucose can be hard if signs are confusing and you can't
test [113].
Perform a thorough assessment in these cases [114].
Contact the hospital to help sort out signs and symptoms [114].
Coordinate communication and documentation [114].
Patients refusing transport after symptoms improve with oral glucose need
thorough documentation [114].
Oral glucose preparations are available [115].
Rapidly dissolving gel [115].
Large chewable tablets [115].
Liquid formulation [115].
Contraindications for oral glucose: inability to swallow and patient being
unconscious [116].
Wear gloves before putting anything in a patient's mouth [117].
Follow local protocols for glucose administration [118].
Reassess frequently and transport [118].
hypoglycemia is a possible cause of seizures [119].
Seizures may indicate a life-threatening underlying condition [120].
Management of seizures:
Maintain the airway [121].
Place the patient on their side if no cervical spine trauma [121].
Do not place anything in the mouth [121].
Have suction ready if the patient vomits [121].
Provide oxygen or artificial ventilations if cyanotic or breathing
inadequately [121].
Transport promptly [121].
Altered mental status may be caused by complications like hypoglycemia or
ketoacidosis [122].
Use the mnemonic AEIOU TIPS for altered mental status [122].
Always suspect and check blood glucose in patients with altered mental
status [122].
Management of altered mental status:
Ensure the airway is clear [123].
Be prepared to provide artificial ventilations [123].
Be prepared to suction if they vomit [123].
Provide transport promptly [123].
Diabetic emergencies can be misdiagnosed as neurological dysfunction or
intoxication [124].
An emergency medical identification (bracelet, necklace, card) can be lifesaving
[125].
A blood glucose test can identify the real problem [126].
Be alert for diabetes and alcoholism coexisting [126].
Regarding airway management:
Diabetic patients may not have a gag reflex and vomit [127].
The tongue may obstruct the airway [127].
Carefully monitor the airway [128].
Place the patient in the lateral recumbent position [128].
Ensure suction is readily available [128].
9. Introduction to Hematologic Emergencies
Now transitioning from endocrine to hematologic emergencies [129].
Hematology is the study of blood-related diseases [130].
Three disorders can create pre-hospital emergencies [131].
sickle cell disease [131].
hemophilia [131].
thrombophilia [131].
anemia is also discussed [131].
10. Anatomy and Physiology of Blood
Blood consists of four main components [133].
erythrocytes (red blood cells) [133].
leukocytes (white blood cells) [133].
platelets [133].
Plasma [133].
Each component contributes to maintaining the body's hemostatic balance
[134].
Red blood cells contain hemoglobin [134].
They carry oxygen to the tissues [134].
White blood cells respond to infection [135].
They collect dead cells and manage their disposal [135].
platelets are essential for clotting [136].
Plasma serves as the transport medium for blood components, proteins, and
minerals [137].
Blood Component Function Source

[133]
Leukocytes (White

[133]
Platelets Essential for clotting
[133]
Plasma Transport medium for blood components,
proteins, minerals
[133]
11. Sickle Cell Disease: Pathophysiology, Complications, and
Assessment
sickle cell disease, or hemoglobin s disease, is an inherited blood disorder
[138].
It primarily affects red blood cells [138].
It is predominantly found in people of African, Caribbean, or South American
ancestry [138].
Patients have misshapen red blood cells (sickle-shaped) [138].
Sickled cells lead to dysfunction in oxygen binding [138].
They also cause unintentional clot formation [138].
Sickle cells have a short lifespan, resulting in more cellular waste [139].
This waste contributes to sludging or clumping of blood [139].
Maintaining hydration is important [139].
Insufficient hydration increases blood clumping [139].
Complications of sickle cell disease include:
anemia, gallstones, jaundice, and spleen dysfunction [140].
Vascular occlusion with ischemia [141].
Acute chest syndrome, strokes, joint necrosis, pain crisis [141].
Acute or chronic organ dysfunction or failure, retinal hemorrhages [141].
Increased risk of infections [141].
Many complications are very painful and potentially life-threatening [142].
Patients are more susceptible to infections [143].
Assessment findings in sickle cell crisis:
Increased respirations or signs of pneumonia [167].
Increased heart rate [170].
Swelling of fingers and toes, priapism, or jaundice [173].
Pain (isolated or throughout the body) [174].
Visual disturbances [174].
Nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramping [174].
Chest pain or shortness of breath [174].
Vital signs may be normal to rapid respirations, weak rapid pulse, pale
clammy skin, or low blood pressure [177].
12. Clotting Disorders: Hemophilia and Thrombophilia
Clotting disorders affect the blood's ability to clot properly [144].
hemophilia is a rare disorder [145].
Only about 20,000 Americans have this disorder [145].
hemophilia A affects mostly males [146].
People with hemophilia A have a decreased ability to create a clot after injury
[147].
This decreased ability can be life-threatening [147].
Patients can be prescribed medications to replace missing clotting factors
[148].
Medications can also prevent the breakdown of blood clots [148].
Common complications of hemophilia A include:
Long-term joint problems (may need joint replacements) [149].
Bleeding in the brain [149].
Thrombosis due to treatment [149].
thrombophilia is a disorder of the blood's ability to flow smoothly [150].
It affects the venous and arterial systems [150].
Concentrations of blood elements create clogging or blockage issues [151].
thrombophilia is a general term for conditions causing blood to clot more
easily [152].
It can be an inherited or genetic disorder [152].
Other causes include medications, other factors, or cancer [152].
Clots can develop spontaneously in the blood [153].
13. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Causes, Risk Factors, and
Treatment
deep vein thrombosis (dvt) is a common medical problem [154].
It occurs in sedentary patients and those with recent injury or surgery [154].
Methods to prevent blood clot formation include:
Blood thinning medications [154].
Compression stockings [154].
Mechanical devices [154].
Risk factors for DVT include:
Recent history of some type of replacement [155].
Complications of leg swelling [155].
Remaining sedentary for long periods [155].
Treatment for DVTs includes anticoagulation therapy [156].
Oral medications are typically given for at least three months [157].
A clot from a DVT may travel from the leg to the lung [157].
This causes a pulmonary emboli [158].
14. Anemia: Causes and Impact on Oxygen Delivery
anemia is an abnormally low number of red blood cells [159].
Causes include chronic or acute bleeding [160].
Deficiency in certain vitamins or minerals can cause anemia [160].
An underlying disease process may also be responsible [160].
anemia impairs the blood's ability to deliver adequate oxygen to tissues [160].
Pulse oximetry may show inadequate saturation [160].
This can happen even if underlying tissues are hypoxic [160].
15. Patient Assessment for Hematologic Emergencies
Begin with scene size-up [161].
Ensure scene safety [161].
Most sickle cell patients have experienced a crisis before [162].
Wear gloves and eye protection at a minimum [163].
Determine the number of patients involved [163].
Be alert for possible trauma [164].
Consider advanced life support (ALS) [164].
Perform a primary assessment [165].
Perform cervical immobilization if needed [165].
Form the general impression [165].
Proceed to the ABCs [165].
For inadequate breathing or altered mental status, give high flow oxygen (12-
15 L via non-rebreather) [166].
Sickle cell crisis patients may have increased respirations or pneumonia signs
[167].
For difficulty breathing, open the airway, insert adjuncts, administer oxygen,
and assist ventilations if needed [168].
Assess the patient's circulatory status [169].
Sickle cell crisis patients will have increased heart rate [170].
This helps force sickled cells through smaller vessels [170].
For suspected hemophilia, be alert for signs of blood loss [170].
Note bleeding of unknown origin [170].
Be alert for signs of hypoxia due to blood loss [170].
Make the transport decision (the "D") [171].
Rapid transport to the emergency room is recommended for any patient
experiencing a sickle cell crisis or hemophilia [171].
Perform history taking [172].
Investigate the chief complaint [172].
Obtain history of the present illness from responsive patients, family, or
bystanders [172].
Be alert for signs of sickle cell crisis [173].
Swelling of fingers/toes, priapism, jaundice [173].
Ask specific questions:
Is pain isolated or throughout the body? [174].
Any visual disturbances? [174].
Experiencing nausea, vomiting, or abdominal cramping? [174].
Experiencing chest pain or shortness of breath? [174].
Obtain a SAMPLE history from responsive patients or family [175].
Ask if they've had a crisis before, when the last one was, and how it resolved
[175].
Ask about recent illnesses, unusual activity, or stress [175].
Conduct a secondary assessment [175].
Systematically examine the patient, focusing on the joints [175].
Evaluate and document the mental status [175].
Obtain a complete set of vital signs, including oxygen saturation [176].
Normal sickle cell crisis vital signs: normal to rapid respirations, weak rapid
pulse, pale clammy skin, or low blood pressure [177].
Use pulse ox to monitor oxygen saturation [178].
Readings may be inaccurate in anemic patients [178].

16. Emergency Medical Care for Hematologic Emergencies
Reassess vital signs frequently to track changes in the patient's condition
[179].
Evaluate the effectiveness of interventions performed [180].
Communicate with hospital staff for continuity of care [180].
Document clearly all findings and care provided [180].
Emergency care for hematologic emergencies is mainly supportive and
symptomatic [182].
For patients with inadequate breathing or altered mental status, provide high
flow oxygen (12-15 L/min) [182].
Place the patient in a position of comfort [182].
Transport rapidly to the hospital [182].
17. Review Questions and Conclusion
This concludes Chapter 20 on endocrine and hematologic emergencies [183].
Review questions help assess understanding of the material [183].
Type 1 diabetes impairs glucose utilization because cells lack insulin [184].
In a patient with Type 1 diabetes found unresponsive, asking if they took
insulin is most important [186].
Dehydration in a diabetic patient with high blood glucose is due to the kidneys
excreting glucose and water [187].
Skipping a meal but still taking insulin would most likely cause a hypoglycemic
crisis [188].
For an unresponsive diabetic patient, the first action is to open the airway [191]
.
kussmaul respirations (rapid and deep) are typical in diabetic ketoacidosis
(dka) [193].
Excessive urination, thirst, hunger, altered mental status, and fast breathing in
a child suggest a hyperglycemic crisis (DKA) [195].
If cells don't receive glucose, they metabolize fat [198].
Fat metabolism results in keto acids [199].
Compared to a hyperglycemic crisis, a hypoglycemic crisis usually responds
immediately to treatment with sugar [200].
Patients with DKA experience polydipsia (thirst) because they are dehydrated
from excessive urination [202].
