# Module 4: Airway Management & Adjuncts

---

## Chapter 11: Airway Management

### Overview
Details airway anatomy, techniques for airway assessment and management, and use of airway adjuncts in EMS.

### Learning Objectives
- Identify airway anatomy and common obstructions.
- Perform airway maneuvers and use adjuncts.
- Recognize and treat airway emergencies.

### Key Terms
| Term   | Definition |
|--------|------------|
| OPA    | Oropharyngeal airway. |
| NPA    | Nasopharyngeal airway. |
| Suction | Removal of secretions/obstructions. |
| Head-tilt chin-lift | Maneuver for opening airway. |

### Major Concepts & Guidelines
- Airway patency is critical for life.
- Use maneuver appropriate for patient condition (trauma vs non-trauma).
- Adjuncts (OPA, NPA) maintain open airway when manual maneuvers insufficient.

### Procedures / Protocols
- **Manual Maneuvers:**  
  - Head-tilt chin-lift (non-trauma).
  - Jaw-thrust (trauma).
- **Adjuncts:**  
  - Measure and insert OPA/NPA.
  - Suction as needed.

### Assessment & Clinical Pearls
- Listen for abnormal sounds (stridor, snoring, gurgling).
- Airway assessment is continuous.

### Documentation Standards
- Document airway status, interventions, and patient response.

### Case Example
> Unresponsive patient with snoring respirations. What is the first airway intervention?

### Quick Reference Table
| Adjunct | Indication | Contraindication |
|---------|------------|------------------|
| OPA     | Unresponsive, no gag | Responsive, gag reflex |

### Review Questions
1. What is the jaw-thrust maneuver used for?
2. When is an NPA preferred?
3. What are signs of airway obstruction?
