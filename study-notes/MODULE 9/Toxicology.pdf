1. Introduction to Toxicology and Poisoning
toxicology is the study of toxic or poisonous substances [5].
A poison is any substance that can damage body structures or impair body
function through chemical action [6].
A toxin is a poisonous substance produced by bacteria, animals, or plants [7].
toxins act by changing normal cell metabolism or destroying cells [8].
toxins can have either acute (fast) or chronic (slower) effects [8].
substance abuse is misusing any substance to produce a desired effect [9].
overdosing is a common complication, occurring when a patient takes a
toxic dose [9].
acute poisonings affect over 2 million people annually [4].
chronic poisonings are more common [4].
Deaths from poisonings are fairly rare [5].
Child deaths from poisoning have decreased since the 1960s due to childresistant
caps [5].
Adult deaths from chronic poisoning are rising due to drug abuse [5].
Recognizing that a poisoning has occurred is your primary responsibility [10].
Pay attention to your surroundings for your own safety to avoid exposure [10].
Even small amounts of some poisons can cause considerable damage or
death [11].
If you suspect toxic substance ingestion or exposure, notify medical control
immediately [12].
Begin emergency treatment at once [12].
Poisoning Type Onset Duration
Acute Sudden onset [4] Fast effects [8]
Chronic Longer-term [4] Slower effects [8]
2. Routes of Poison Exposure
How you treat poisoning depends on how the poison entered the body [17].
There are four main routes of poison entry [17].
inhalation [18]
absorption (surface contact) [18]
ingestion [18]
injection [18]
All four routes can lead to life-threatening conditions [18].
Route Description Initial Emergency Actions
Inhalation Breathing in
poisonous
substances [18]
Move patient to fresh air [18]. Provide supplemental
oxygen [19]. Call Hazmat for toxic gas [19].
Immediate transport [20]. Suction available [21].
Absorption Contact with
skin or mucous
membranes [18]
Avoid self-contamination [25]. Remove substance
and contaminated clothing [25]. Flush and wash
skin (brush dry powder first) [26]. Irrigate eyes [28].
Hazmat assistance [29]. Decontaminate thoroughly
[29]. Prompt transport [30]. Obtain material safety
data sheet [31].
Ingestion Swallowing
poisonous
substances [18]
Treat signs and symptoms [36]. Notify poison
control and medical control [36]. Protect airway if
altered mental status [37]. Consider preventing
further absorption (e.g., activated charcoal) [37].
Injection Entry via
needle or bite
[18]
Monitor airway, provide high flow oxygen [40]. Be
alert for nausea and vomiting [40]. Remove
rings/watches/bracelets from injection site [41].
Cannot be diluted or removed in the field [38].
Prompt transport [38].
3. Patient Assessment in Poisoning Emergencies
Patient assessment for toxins begins with scene size-up [42].
Scene size-up involves standard precautions [43].
Look for clues like odors, bottles, syringes, pills, or chemicals [43].
Check for missing medication or drug paraphernalia [44].
Be aware of potential drug labs [44].
Keep an open mind and avoid mistaken conclusions [44].
Primary assessment determines the patient's condition severity [45].
Obtain a general impression [45].
Assess level of consciousness and life threats [45].
Do not assume a conscious patient is stable [45].
Assess the ABCs and D [46].
Airway and Breathing: Ensure an open airway and adequate ventilation [46]
.
Provide oxygen therapy for difficulty breathing [47].
Consider airway adjuncts for unresponsive patients [47].
Have suction ready as patients are susceptible to vomiting [48].
Circulation: Assess pulse and skin condition [49]. Variations depend on the
substance [49].
Transport decision: Prompt transport for patients with altered ABCs or a
poor general impression [50].
Hazardous material exposures require thorough decontamination by
Hazmat before transport [51].
History taking is next, if the patient is responsive [52].
Investigate the chief complaint [52].
Obtain a sample history [53].
Ask specific questions about the substance: what, when, how much, over
what period, interventions used, and patient weight [54].
If the patient is unresponsive, get history from other sources [53].
Secondary assessment focuses on the exposure route or affected body area
[56].
Review all body systems to identify systemic problems [57].
Obtain a complete set of baseline vital signs [58].
Changes in consciousness, pulse, respirations, blood pressure, and skin
indicate serious issues [58].
Reassessment is continuous [59].
Continually check ABCs adequacy [59].
Repeat vital signs and compare to baseline [59].
Evaluate intervention effectiveness [60].
Take vital signs every 15 minutes for stable patients, every 5 minutes for
unstable patients or those who ingested a harmful dose [60].
4. General Treatment and Activated Charcoal
General treatment principles involve supporting the ABCs [61]. This is the most
important task [61].
Contact medical control or a poison center to discuss treatment [62].
Manage airborne exposures with oxygen [62].
Remove contact exposures with copious water, unless contraindicated [62].
Consider activated charcoal for ingested poisons [62].
activated charcoal binds to specific toxins [64].
It prevents toxin absorption in the body [64].
toxins are carried out in the stool [65].
activated charcoal is not indicated for certain ingestions [66].
These include alkali poisons, cyanide, ethanol, iron, lithium, methanol,
mineral acids, or organic solvents [67].
Patients with a decreased level of consciousness should not receive activated
charcoal because they cannot protect their airway [68].
activated charcoal often comes as a pre-mixed suspension, typically 50
grams per bottle [69].
The usual dose is one gram per kilogram of body weight for adults or children
[69].
Always call medical control for pre-approval before administering activated
charcoal [70].
Shake the bottle vigorously to mix [71].
Convince the patient to drink it, but never force them [71].
Record the time of administration [72].
If the patient refuses, document the refusal and your attempts to counsel
them [72].
Transport the patient for further evaluation [72].
Side effects of activated charcoal include constipation and black stools [73].
If the patient vomits after taking charcoal, the dose may need to be repeated
[74].
Indication Contraindication
Ingestion of
certain toxins
Ingestion of alkali poison, cyanide, ethanol, iron, lithium,
methanol, mineral acids, or organic solvents [67]
Prevent toxin
absorption
Decreased level of consciousness (unable to protect airway)
[68]
Toxins carried out
in stool
5. Specific Types of Poisons and Their Management
tolerance is when a person needs increasing amounts of a substance to
achieve the same result [76]. This builds up over time [212].
addiction is an overwhelming desire to continue using a substance, often
increasing the dose [77].
Safety awareness and standard precautions are crucial when caring for drug
abusers [78].
Known drug abusers have a high incidence of serious infections like HIV
and hepatitis [79].
The drug user, not the drug, can pose the greatest threat [80].
Alcohol is a central nervous system depressant, sedative, and hypnotic [85].
It dulls senses, slows reflexes, and reduces reaction time [87].
It can cause aggressive behavior and lack of coordination [88].
Binge drinking (occasional heavy use) can be very damaging [84].
Severe acute ingestion can cause hypoglycemia [90]. Check blood sugar
levels [90].
Alcohol increases the effects of other drugs [91].
Provide respiratory support for severe CNS depression [92]. Emesis can
result from respiratory depression [93].
Alcohol withdrawal can cause hallucinations or delirium tremens (DTs) [94].
DTs include agitation, restlessness, fever, sweating, tremors, confusion,
delusions, or seizures [95].
Withdrawal symptoms can occur after stopping or reducing alcohol
intake [96].
Provide transport, reassurance, care, and emotional support for
withdrawal [96]. Withdrawal is as dangerous as too much alcohol [96].
opiates are narcotics that produce sleep and altered consciousness [98].
They are used for pain relief [99].
Prescription opiates are commonly abused [100]. Physical dependence can
develop from medical prescriptions [101].
opiates are CNS depressants and cause severe respiratory depression [101]
. This can lead to cardiac arrest [101].
tolerance develops quickly; users may need massive doses [102].
Nausea and vomiting are common [104]. Hypotension can occur [104].
Seizures are uncommon but possible [104].
Patients are typically sedated, unconscious, cyanotic with pinpoint pupils
[105].
naloxone (Narcan) reverses opiate/opioid overdose effects [105]. It can be
given IV, IM, or IN [106].
EMTs often administer naloxone intranasally (IN) [107]. Use it for agonal
respirations or apnea due to opioids [108].
Ask bystanders if naloxone was given before your arrival [111].
Sedative-Hypnotic Drugs (barbiturates, benzodiazepines) are CNS
depressants that alter consciousness [112].
They are easily obtained and relatively cheap [112].
Effects are similar to alcohol; patients may be drowsy, peaceful, or
intoxicated [113].
Taken orally, sometimes dissolved or injected [115].
tolerance develops quickly, requiring larger doses [116].
Can be used as "knockout drugs" [117].
Treatment: Ensure patent airway, assist ventilations, and provide prompt
transport [118].
abused inhalants are agents inhaled rather than ingested or injected [119].
Include acetone, glue, cleaning compounds, paint thinners, lacquers,
gasoline, Freon [121].
Commonly abused by teenagers [123].
Effects range from drowsiness to coma and seizures [123].
Hydrocarbon solvents make the heart hypersensitive to adrenaline [123].
Keep patients from struggling or exerting themselves [123].
Provide oxygen and transport [123].
hydrogen sulfide is a highly toxic, odorless, flammable gas with a rotten
egg smell [124]. It affects lungs and CNS [125]. Used in "detergent suicides"
[125].
Be alert for warning signs, containers, buckets in enclosed vehicles
[125]. Wait for Hazmat to declare the scene safe [125].
Signs include nausea, vomiting, confusion, dyspnea, loss of
consciousness, seizures, shock, coma, cardiopulmonary arrest [126].
After decontamination, management is supportive: monitor respiratory
and cardiovascular function, provide rapid transport [127].
Central Nervous System Stimulants (sympathomimetics) mimic the
sympathetic nervous system [129].
They cause hypertension, tachycardia, and dilated pupils [130].
Produce an excited state [131].
Examples: amphetamines, methamphetamines, MDMA (ecstasy/Molly),
cocaine [131].
Cocaine can be absorbed through mucous membranes or skin [132].
Effects last less than an hour [132]. Smoking cocaine (crack) gives the
fastest and most potent effect [133].
Acute overdose is an emergency due to high risk of seizures, cardiac
dysrhythmias, and stroke [133].
Patients may have hallucinations or paranoia [134].
Law enforcement may need to restrain the patient [134]. Do not leave
unattended during transport [135].
Provide prompt transport, supplemental oxygen, and be ready to suction
[135].
bath salts are synthetic drugs similar to MDMA [136].
Sold as bath salts to evade legal restrictions [139].
Produce euphoria, increased mental clarity, and sexual arousal [140]. Users
often snort it [140]. Effects can last 48 hours [140].
Adverse effects: teeth grinding, appetite loss, muscle twitching, lip
smacking, confusion, GI issues, paranoia, headache, elevated heart rate,
hallucinations [141].
Keep the patient calm and transport [141]. Consider advanced life support;
chemical restraint may be needed for safe transport [142].
marijuana contains thc, which produces the high [143].
Inhaling smoke causes euphoria, relaxation, drowsiness [144].
Impairs short-term memory and complex thinking [145].
High doses can cause depression, confusion, hallucinations, anxiety,
paranoia [146].
Often used to introduce other drugs [148].
Edibles (baked goods, candies with thc) can cause cannabinoid
hyperemesis syndrome [149].
This is extreme nausea and vomiting in chronic users, relieved only by
hot showers/baths [150].
Synthetic marijuana (spice) mimics thc effects but can have powerful and
unpredictable outcomes [151]. Effects range from euphoria to loss of
consciousness [151].
Hallucinogens alter sensory perceptions [152].
LSD (acid) is a classic example [153].
Cause visual hallucinations, intensify vision/hearing, separate user from
reality [153].
A "bad trip" can include hypertension, tachycardia, anxiety, paranoia [154].
Care is similar to sympathomimetic overdose: use a calm, professional
manner [155].
Provide emotional support [156]. Avoid restraints unless the patient is in
danger [157].
Watch the patient carefully; never leave unattended during transport [158].
Request advanced life support if appropriate [158].
Anticholinergic Agents block parasympathetic nerves [159].
Classic signs: "hot as a hare, blind as a bat, dry as a bone, red as a beet,
and mad as a hatter" [160].
Common examples: atropine, Benadryl, gypsum weed, Elavil [160].
Difficult to distinguish from sympathomimetic overdose; both can cause
agitation, high heart rate, dilated pupils [160].
Tricyclic antidepressants have significant anticholinergic effects [161].
Death can be rapid (normal to seizure/death in 30 mins) [161].
Immediate transport is crucial [161]. Consider calling advanced life support
[161].
Cholinergic Agents overstimulate parasympathetic functions [162].
Include nerve gas (chemical warfare) and organophosphate insecticides
[162].
Signs are easy to remember using mnemonics "DUMBELS" or "SLUDGE M"
[164].
DUMBELS: Diarrhea, Urination, Miosis, Bradycardia, Emesis,
Lacrimation, Seizures [164].
SLUDGE M: Salivation, Lacrimation, Urination, Defecation, Gastric
upsets, Emesis, Muscle twitching [165].
Anticholinergics have the exact opposite effects [166].
Avoiding self-exposure is the most important consideration [167].
Decontamination is a priority [167]. hazmat teams often provide
decontamination [168].
After decontamination, priorities are decreasing mouth/trachea secretions
and providing airway support [168].
Antidote kits exist for cholinergic agents, e.g., DuoDote auto-injector [169].
DuoDote contains atropine and pralidoxime [170]. Use for known nerve
agent/organophosphate exposure with symptoms [170]. You may need to
use it on yourself [170].
Miscellaneous Drugs include various classifications [171].
Cardiac medicines: Accidental or intentional overdose [171]. Children may
think they are candy; older adults may forget doses [171]. Symptoms vary
by medication [172]. Contact poison control ASAP [172].
Aspirin: Ingesting too much can cause nausea, vomiting, hyperventilation,
ringing in ears [173]. Patients may have anxiety, confusion, tachypnea,
hyperthermia, and be in danger of seizures [174].
Acetaminophen: Overdose is common and serious, whether accidental or
intentional [175].
Alcohols (methyl or ethyl glycol) are more toxic than drinking alcohol [175].
They cause severe tachypnea, blindness, renal failure, and potentially
death [175].
Food Poisoning: Caused by bacteria or toxins [176].
Salmonella bacterium causes severe GI symptoms (nausea, vomiting,
abdominal pain, diarrhea) within 72 hours [176]. Proper cooking and
kitchen cleanliness prevent it [178].
Staphylococcus bacteria grow quickly in unrefrigerated leftovers and
produce toxins [179]. Symptoms start suddenly (nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea) within 2-12 hours [181].
Botulism is the most severe form, resulting from improperly canned
food [182]. Bacterial spores grow and produce a toxin [184]. Symptoms
are neurologic: blurred vision, weakness, difficulty speaking/breathing
[185]. It can be fatal; symptoms develop within 24 hours to 4 days [186].
Do not try to determine the specific food poisoning cause in acute
cases [187]. Gather history and transport promptly [187]. Take suspected
food if multiple people are ill [188].
Plant Poisonings: Tens of thousands of cases annually [189]. Many
household plants are poisonous [190].
Effects vary: local skin irritation, effects on circulatory/GI/CNS systems
[191].
Impossible to memorize all poisonous plants and effects [192].
Assess airway and vital signs [193]. Notify poison control for plant
identification assistance [193]. Take the plant with you to the hospital
[193].

6. Case Studies and Review Questions
Understanding key questions for poisoning assessment is important [198].
Asking why a patient intentionally overdosed is the least pertinent EMT
question [198].
If a patient vomits after ingesting a substance, collect the vomit to bring to the
hospital and look for pill fragments [200].
When caring for a surface contact poisoning, the first priority is to avoid
contaminating yourself [204].
Most poisonings occur via ingestion, accounting for about 80% of cases [205].
activated charcoal dosage is calculated based on patient weight in kilograms
[206]. The dose is one gram per kilogram [206]. To convert pounds to kilograms,
divide by 2.2 [206]. A 55-pound child needs about 25 grams [206].
When a person needs increasing amounts of a substance to achieve the same
effect over time, this is called developing tolerance [210].
Binge drinking does not increase a sense of awareness; it typically causes a
dull sense of awareness [213].
An unconscious patient with slow and shallow respirations, slow/weak pulse,
and constricted (pinpoint) pupils is consistent with an opioid overdose [215].
This patient would likely need naloxone [217].
The mnemonic "DUMBELS" helps recall the signs and symptoms of a
cholinergic drug overdose [218]. The "E" in DUMBELS stands for emesis
(vomiting) [218].
Food poisoning is almost always caused by eating foods containing bacteria,
such as salmonella [218].
