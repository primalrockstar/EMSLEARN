1. Introduction to Allergy and Anaphylaxis
This chapter covers allergy and anaphylaxis. [1]
EMTs often respond to calls involving allergic reactions. [5]
Allergy-related emergencies can involve acute airway obstruction and
cardiovascular collapse. [6]
You must be able to treat these life-threatening complications. [7]
It is important to distinguish between a usual response and an allergic
reaction. [7]
2. Anatomy, Physiology, and Pathophysiology of Allergic
Reactions
Immunology is the study of the body's immune system. [8]
The immune system protects the body from foreign substances. [10]
When a foreign substance invades, the body tries to activate or inactivate it.
[11]
An allergic reaction is an exaggerated immune response. [13]
It is caused by the body's immune system, not directly by an outside
substance. [14]
The immune system releases chemicals to combat the stimulus. [15]
These chemicals include histamines and leukotrienes. [16]
Both contribute to an allergic reaction. [16]

3. Recognizing Allergic Reactions and Anaphylaxis
Some patients may not know what is causing their reaction. [17]
You must be able to recognize the signs and symptoms. [17]
Maintain a high index of suspicion. [17]
An allergic reaction can be mild and local. [18]
Mild reactions are characterized by itching, redness, and tenderness. [18]
An allergic reaction can be severe and systemic. [18]
This severe systemic condition is known as anaphylaxis. [18]
Anaphylaxis is an extreme, life-threatening allergic reaction. [19]
It involves multiple organ systems. [20]
Severe cases can rapidly result in shock and death. [20]
Severity Signs and Symptoms
Mild Itching [18], Redness [18], Tenderness [18]
Severe Urticaria (hives) [21], Angioedema [21], Wheezing or stridor [21],
Hypotension [22], Increased capillary permeability [22], Nausea [23],
Vomiting [23], Abdominal cramps [23]
4. Common Allergens and Their Characteristics
Common allergens fall into five categories. [25]
The first category is food. [25]
Certain foods like shellfish and peanuts are common triggers of
anaphylaxis. [26]
Symptoms may take over 30 minutes to appear. [27]
Skin signs like hives may not be present. [27]
Reactions can be severe and involve respiratory or cardiovascular
systems. [28]
The second category is medications. [29]
Medications are the second most common source of anaphylactic
reactions. [29]
Antibiotics like penicillin are common. [30]
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are also common. [30]
Injected medications can cause immediate and severe reactions. [31]
Reactions to oral medications may take over 30 minutes. [32]
Oral medication reactions can also be very severe. [32]
The third category is plants. [33]
This includes dust, pollens, and other plant material. [33]
Plants can cause rapid and severe allergic reactions. [33]
Common plant allergens include ragweed, rye grass, maple, and oak. [34]
The fourth category is chemicals. [35]
Certain chemicals like makeup and paradine can cause reactions. [35]
Latex is of particular concern to healthcare providers. [36]
Use latex alternatives such as nitrile gloves. [37]
The fifth category is insect bites and stings. [38]
This involves venomation, where the insect injects venom. [38]
Reactions can be localized or severe and systemic. [38]
Category Examples Characteristics

Insect
Bites/Stings [38]
Bees, wasps,
hornets, fire ants
[39]
Localized or severe systemic, venom
injection [38]
5. Insect Bites and Stings: Specific Considerations
Insect bites and stings involve venomation. [38]
Venomation is the injection of venom by the insect. [38]
Reactions can be localized or severe and systemic. [38]
Approximately 2 million Americans are allergic to bee, wasp, and hornet
venom. [39]
Allergic reactions to stings cause at least 62 deaths per year in the US. [39]
About half of victims had no prior reaction. [40]
Most insects have a small hollow spine stinger. [40]
Honey bees cannot withdraw their stinger. [41]
An embedded stinger can inject venom for up to 20 minutes. [42]
Wasps and hornets can sting multiple times. [42]
Fire ants strike repeatedly. [43]
Initial signs include sudden pain, swelling, and localized heat. [44]
Widespread urticaria, redness, itching, and a wheal may appear. [44]
Severe cases (anaphylaxis) include stridor and bronchospasm. [45]
Wheezing, chest tightness, coughing, and dyspnea can occur. [45]
Anxiety, gastrointestinal complaints, and hypotension are possible. [45]
Respiratory failure can occasionally occur. [45]
Untreated anaphylaxis can rapidly lead to death. [45]
More than two-thirds of anaphylaxis deaths occur within the first 30 minutes.
[46]
6. Patient Assessment for Allergic Reactions
Start with scene size-up. [47]
Scene safety is most important. [48]
The environment or recent activity may indicate the source. [48]
A respiratory problem dispatch report may suggest allergy. [48]
Rule out other causes of respiratory distress. [49]
Trauma may be present secondary to the medical issue. [50]
Follow standard precautions (gloves, eye protection). [50]
Consider the need for advanced life support. [51]
Perform a primary assessment. [52]
Quickly identify and treat immediate threats. [52]
ABCs should be reassessed repeatedly. [53]
Form your general impression. [54]
Allergic reactions may present as respiratory or cardiovascular distress
(shock). [54]
If the patient is anxious and in distress, call for ALS backup. [55]
Look for a medical identification tag if unresponsive. [56]
Airway and breathing are major concerns. [57]
Anaphylaxis can rapidly cause upper airway swelling. [57]
Quickly assess for increased work of breathing. [59]
Look for accessory muscle use, head bobbing, and tripod position. [59]
Check for nasal flaring and abnormal breath sounds. [60]
Assist the patient into a comfortable position (high Fowler's). [60]
Place in the supine position if signs of shock emerge. [60]
Assist ventilations with a BVM and high oxygen for severe distress. [61]
Assess circulation (C). [62]
Some anaphylaxis patients show signs of circulatory stress (hypotension).
[63]
Assess for signs of hypoperfusion. [64]
Treat for shock. [64]
Definitive treatment for anaphylaxis is Epi. [65]
Make your transport decision. [66]
Immediate transport is needed if anaphylaxis is suspected. [66]
Transport if a mild reaction appears to be worsening. [66]
If the patient is calm, consider continuing assessment. [67]
Err on the side of emergency transport. [67]
Take a history. [68]
Investigate the chief complaint and history of present illness. [68]
Identify signs and symptoms. [68]
Obtain a SAMPLE history. [69]
If responsive, ask specific allergy questions. [70]
Ask if interventions have been completed. [70]
Ask if the patient had a severe reaction before. [70]
Ask about ingestion of common food allergens. [70]
Inquire about gastrointestinal complaints (nausea, vomiting). [71]
Conduct a secondary assessment. [72]
Perform a rapid head-to-toe exam if indicated. [73]
Focus the physical exam on the chief complaint area. [73]
Remove clothing if unconscious to look for clues. [74]
Look for bee stingers or signs of chemical contact. [74]
Look for a medical alert tag. [75]
Auscultate for abnormal breath sounds (wheezing, stridor). [75]
Inspect the skin for swelling, rashes, or urticaria. [75]
Check vital signs. [76]
Assess baseline pulse, respiratory rate, blood pressure. [76]
Check pupillary response and oxygen saturation. [76]
Skin signs may be unreliable indicators of hypoperfusion. [77]

Assessment [72]
Physical exam (rapid or focused), look for
stingers/chemicals/medical tag, auscultate breath sounds,
inspect skin [73]
Vital Signs [76] Assess pulse, respiration, blood pressure, pupils, O2
saturation [76]
7. Monitoring and Reassessment
Monitoring devices are useful. [78]
A pulse oximeter helps assess perfusion status. [78]
The decision to give oxygen is based on airway, work of breathing, and lung
sounds. [79]
It should not be based solely on pulse oximetry readings. [79]
Reassessment is crucial en route to the hospital. [80]
Repeat the primary assessment. [80]
Reassess vital signs. [80]
Repeat a focused exam of the affected system. [80]
Reassess unstable patients every five minutes. [81]
Reassess stable patients every 15 minutes. [81]
Watch for signs of shock and treat immediately. [81]
8. Interventions and Treatment for Allergic Reactions
Treatment depends on the severity of the reaction. [82]
Mild reactions may need only supportive care and monitoring. [83]
Anaphylaxis requires more aggressive treatment. [84]
This includes Epi and ventilatory support. [84]
Recheck your interventions. [84]
Transport to the emergency department is warranted even if the patient feels
relief. [84]
The medication's effect will wear off. [84]
Symptoms will return. [84]
Administer BLS and provide prompt transport for severe reactions. [86]
If a stinger is present, scrape the skin with a stiff object. [87]
Use a credit card or similar object. [88]
Do not use tweezers or forceps. [88]
Gently wash the area with soap or mild anesthetic. [89]
Remove jewelry from the area before swelling starts. [90]
Position the injection site slightly below heart level. [91]
Apply ice or cold packs, but not directly to skin. [92]
Limit cold application to 10 minutes at a time. [92]
Be alert for swelling and airway issues. [93]
Watch for other anaphylaxis signs like nausea and vomiting. [93]
Do not give anything by mouth. [93]
Place the patient in the supine position if indicated. [94]
Give oxygen if needed. [94]
Monitor vital signs. [95]
Be prepared to provide further support. [96]
Severity of
Reaction
Treatment
Mild [83] Supportive care, monitoring [83]
Severe
(Anaphylaxis) [84]
Aggressive treatment, Epi, ventilatory support, prompt
transport [84]
Specific Actions
(Stinger Present)
Scrape stinger, wash area, remove jewelry, position site,
apply ice, monitor for swelling/airway issues, no oral intake,
position supine, oxygen if needed, monitor vital signs [87]
9. Epinephrine: Mechanism and Administration
Epinephrine (Epi) is a sympathomimetic hormone. [98]
It mimics the sympathetic "fight or flight" response. [98]
It causes blood vessels to constrict. [99]
This reverses vasodilation and hypotension from anaphylaxis. [99]
Epi also increases cardiac contractility. [100]
It relieves bronchospasms in the lungs. [100]
Epi can rapidly reverse the effects of anaphylaxis. [101]
Epi is prescribed by a physician. [102]
It comes pre-dosed in an automatic Epi injector. [102]
Some EMS systems carry Epi. [103]
Others allow EMS providers to help patients self-administer. [103]
Refer to local protocols or medical control. [104]
The adult EpiPen delivers 0.3 milligrams of Epi. [105]
It uses a spring-loaded needle system. [105]
The infant/child system delivers 0.15 milligrams. [106]
Epinephrine can take effect within one minute. [108]
It is the primary way to save someone with severe allergic reaction. [108]
There are side effects. [108]
Side effects include high blood pressure, increased pulse, anxiety. [109]
Cardiac arrhythmias, pallor, dizziness can occur. [109]
Chest pain, headache, nausea, and vomiting are possible. [109]
Patients without respiratory compromise or hypotension should not get Epi.
[110]
Do not give Epi if they don't meet anaphylaxis criteria. [110]
10. Communication and Documentation
Documentation is important following an allergic reaction call. [85]
Include signs and symptoms found during assessment. [85]
Document the reasons for the care provided. [85]
Record the patient's response to treatment. [85]
