1. Introduction to Gynecologic Emergencies
Welcome to chapter 24 on gynecologic emergencies. [1]
After this chapter, you will understand the female reproductive system. [2]
You will also identify and describe assessment and treatment for gynecologic
emergencies. [2]
Special considerations for sexual assault cases are also discussed. [3]
2. Anatomy and Physiology of the Female Reproductive System
Structure Location/Description Function
External
Genitalia
Vaginal opening, labia, clitoris,
perineum
[5]
Ovaries Each side of the lower abdomen Produce an ovum (egg)
[6]
Fallopian tubes Connect each ovary to the uterus Fertilization occurs
here [15]
Uterus Muscular organ Fetus grows here
during pregnancy [8]
Cervix Narrowest part of the uterus, opens
into the vagina
[8]
Vagina Outermost cavity of the reproductive
system
[9]
Menarche Onset of menstruation, typically ages
11-16
Indicates capability of
pregnancy [11]
Menopause End of menstrual activity, usually
around 50 years old
[12]
Ovulation Release of one ovum into the fallopian
tubes each month
[13]
Fertilization Begins in the vagina, sperm travels to
fallopian tubes
Embryo travels to
uterus and grows [14]
Menstruation Occurs if fertilization does not happen
within 14 days of ovulation
Uterine lining
separates [16]
Female
Hormones
Produced primarily in the ovaries Control ovulation and
menstruation [17]
3. Common Gynecologic Emergencies: Pathophysiology and
Symptoms
Condition Pathophysiology Common Symptoms Risk Factors
Pelvic
Inflammatory
Disease (PID)
Infection of upper
reproductive organs
(fallopian tubes,
ovaries) [20]
Generalized lower
abdominal pain [23],
abnormal or foulsmelling
vaginal
discharge [24],
increased pain with
intercourse [24], fever
[24], general malaise
Multiple sexual
partners [25],
untreated STDs
[26], history of
PID [26],
sexually active
under 26 [26],
[24], nausea and
vomiting [24]
douching [26],
IUD use [26]
Sexually
Transmitted
Diseases
(STDs)
Infections spread
through sexual
contact [27]
Can be mild or absent
[30], can lead to PID [28]
, premature birth or low
birth weight (Bacterial
Vaginosis) [33],
susceptible to other
infections (Bacterial
Vaginosis) [33],
cramping [35],
abdominal pain [35],
nausea [35], vomiting
[35], bleeding between
periods (Gonorrhea)
[35], spread to other
body parts (Gonorrhea
untreated) [36]
Multiple sexual
partners [25],
untreated STDs
[26]
- Chlamydia Most common STD
in the US [29],
infection of cervix
can spread to rectum
and progress to PID
[31]
Usually milder, absent
symptoms [30]
- Bacterial
Vaginosis
Most common
infection for women
aged 15-44 [32]
Untreated can lead to
premature birth or low
birth weight in
pregnancy [33], makes
patient more
susceptible to other
infections [33], can
cause PID [33]
- Gonorrhea Caused by bacteria
that grow in warm,
moist areas of
reproductive tract
[34]
Severe infections
present with cramping,
abdominal pain,
nausea, vomiting, and
bleeding between
periods [35]
Vaginal
Bleeding
Causes include
abnormal
menstruation, vaginal
trauma, ectopic
pregnancy,
spontaneous
abortion, polyps, or
cancer [38]
Visible bleeding [57],
quality and quantity
important to note [60]
4. Patient Assessment in Gynecologic Emergencies
Obtaining an accurate and detailed assessment is critical. [40]
Scene safety is the first step. [42]
Ask about assistance needed and number of patients. [42]
Determine the nature of the illness. [42]
Take standard precautions, as large amounts of blood and body fluids may be
present. [42]
Document accurately, especially if it's a crime scene. [44]
Involve the police if assault is suspected. [45]
A female EMT should provide care in sexual assault cases if possible. [45]
The primary assessment includes forming a general impression. [47]
Use the AVPU scale for level of consciousness. [47]
Evaluate airway and breathing immediately. [48]
Palpate pulse and evaluate skin color, temperature, and moisture to identify
blood loss. [49]
Most gynecologic emergencies are not life-threatening. [50]
If signs of shock are present, transport is warranted. [51]
History taking involves investigating the chief complaint. [52]
Be sensitive as questions may be personal. [52]
Protect the patient's privacy and dignity. [52]
For abdominal pain, use OPQRST. [53]
Ask about associated symptoms like syncope, nausea, vomiting, or fever. [54]
For vaginal bleeding, follow OPQRST with SAMPLE history. [54]
Ask about birth control, medical conditions, and last menstrual period. [54]
The secondary assessment focuses on the chief complaint area. [56]
Check vital signs. [57]
Assess the abdomen for distension or tenderness. [57]
Note visible bleeding and mental status. [57]
Physical exams should be limited and professional. [58]
Only examine genitalia if necessary for treatment. [58]
For vaginal bleeding, visualize the bleeding. [60]
Ask about the quality and quantity of bleeding. [60]
Observe for vaginal discharge. [60]
Fever, nausea, and vomiting are significant in gynecologic emergencies. [61]
Syncope is also significant and treat as if in shock. [61]
Vital signs include heart rate, respiratory rate, skin condition, cap refill, and
blood pressure. [62]
Consider orthostatic vital signs if bleeding is known or suspected. [62]
5. Emergency Care and Special Considerations
Principle Description
Maintain Privacy Get the patient to a private location if possible.
[63]
Female EMT Participation Have a female EMT participate in patient care if
possible. [63]
Managing Vaginal Bleeding Use sanitary pads on external genitalia to absorb
blood. [64]
Document the number of saturated pads. [65]
Treat external lacerations, abrasions, or tears
with sterile compresses. [66]
Never pack or place dressings in the vagina.
[67]
Assessment and
Management of PID
Patient will complain of abdominal pain. [68]
Pain usually starts during or after menstruation.
[69]
Pain may be worse with walking, causing a
shuffling gait. [70]
Prehospital treatment is limited. [71]
Non-emergency transport is usually
recommended. [71]
Considerations for Sexual
Assault Victims
Sexual assault and rape are common in the US.
[72]
EMTs face medical, psychological, and legal
issues. [73]
Professionalism, tact, kindness, and sensitivity
are important. [74]
Be aware of drugs used to incapacitate a person.
[75]
Offer the patient the option of being treated by a
female EMT. [76]
Focus on medical treatment, psychological care,
and evidence preservation. [77]
Persuade the patient not to clean themselves if
possible. [78]
Offer to call the local Rape Crisis Center. [79]
Limit physical exam to a brief survey for lifethreatening
injuries. [79]
