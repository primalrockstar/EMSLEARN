1. Introduction to Behavioral Health Emergencies
Common Causes of Behavioral Crises
Acute medical situation [6]
Mental illness [6]
Mind-altering substance [6]
Stress [6]
Other causes [6]
This report covers behavioral health emergencies for EMTs [1].
EMTs will learn to recognize behaviors that pose a risk [2].
This includes risks to the EMT, patient, and others [2].
Basic principles of the mental health system are also discussed [2].
EMTs often care for patients experiencing behavioral crisis emergencies [5].
These crises can result from acute medical situations, mental illness, mindaltering
substances, or stress [6].
Behavior is defined as a person's response to the environment over time [19].
Normal coping mechanisms may not be enough during great stress [20].
Negative coping mechanisms like withdrawing or using drugs and alcohol may
be used [20].
Reactions to stress can create a crisis [21].
A change in behavior may be considered inappropriate [22].
A behavioral crisis includes patients of all ages [23].
Patients may exhibit agitated, violent, or uncooperative behavior [23].
They may also be a danger to themselves or others [23].
EMS is called when behavior becomes unacceptable [24].
2. Understanding Mental Health Disorders and Crises
Most people experience an emotional crisis at some point [7].
This does not mean everyone develops a mental illness [7].
Otherwise healthy people can have temporary mental health disorders [8].
Do not assume a patient is mentally ill [9].
Feeling bad or depressed doesn't mean you are sick [10].
There are justifiable reasons for depression [11].
Examples include divorce, job loss, or death of a loved one [11].
This is a normal reaction to an acute crisis [12].
It is a misconception that all individuals with mental health disorders are
dangerous [13].
Only a small percentage of people with mental health problems are violent [14].
EMTs may see more violent patients [15].
This is because they are seeing patients in a behavioral crisis [15].
Mental health disorders are common in the United States [28].
They affect tens of millions of people each year [28].
A psychiatric disorder has psychological or behavioral symptoms [29].
This may result in impaired functioning [29].
Anxiety disorders are among the most common mental health disorders [30].
These include generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and phobias [31].
Post-traumatic stress disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder are also
common [32].
3. Underlying Causes and Pathophysiology
Organic Disorders Functional Disorders
Physical condition [43] Psychological condition [43]
Temporary or permanent brain dysfunction [45] Impair body function when
structurally normal [49]
Caused by disturbance in brain tissue
functioning [45]
Include schizophrenia, some
anxiety conditions, and
depression [50]
Causes: sudden illness, TBI, seizure disorder,
drug/alcohol abuse, overdose, withdrawal,
Alzheimer's, meningitis [46]
Altered mental status from: hypoglycemia,
hypoxia, impaired cerebral blood flow,
hyperthermia, hypothermia [47]
Behavioral health disorders have many underlying causes [36].
These can include social or situational stress [37].
Examples are divorce or death of a loved one [37].
Diseases like schizophrenia can be a cause [38].
Physical illnesses such as a diabetic emergency can also contribute [38].
Chemical problems like alcohol or drug use are causes [38].
Biological disturbances such as electrolyte imbalance can be involved [38].
These conditions can be compounded by not taking prescribed medications
[39].
EMTs are not responsible for diagnosing the underlying cause [41].
They should understand organic and functional diagnoses [42].
An organic disorder is a physical condition [43].
A functional disorder is a psychological condition [43].
organic brain syndrome is brain dysfunction [45].
It can be temporary or permanent [45].
Causes include sudden illness, traumatic brain injury, or seizure disorder
[46].
Drug and alcohol abuse or withdrawal can cause it [46].
Diseases like Alzheimer's and meningitis are causes [46].
Altered mental status can come from hypoglycemia or hypoxia [47].
Impaired cerebral blood flow can also cause it [47].
hyperthermia or hypothermia can alter mental status [47].
functional disorders impair body function [49].
The body seems structurally normal in functional disorders [49].
Examples include schizophrenia and depression [50].
4. Patient Assessment in Behavioral Health Emergencies
A safe approach is crucial for behavioral crises [50].
Patient assessment begins with the scene size-up [51].
Scene safety is the first consideration [51].
Assess the patient's response to the environment [51].
Determine if the situation is dangerous for you and your partner [51].
Immediate law enforcement backup may be needed [51].
You might need to stage until law enforcement secures the scene [51].
Note any medications or substances the patient is taking [53].
This could contribute to the complaint or be a treatment [53].
Form a general impression during the primary assessment [54].
Begin assessment from a safe distance, like the doorway [54].
Perform a rapid physical exam [54].
Observe the patient closely [54].
Use the AVPU scale to check for alertness [54].
Establish a rapport with the patient [55].
Assess the airway to ensure it is open and adequate [55].
Evaluate the patient's breathing rate and effort [56].
Use pulse oximetry if available [57].
Provide appropriate interventions based on findings [57].
Assess the pulse rate, rhythm, and quality [58].
Evaluate for shock and bleeding [59].
Assess the patient's perfusion [59].
Evaluate skin color, temperature, and capillary refill [60].
Spend time with the patient if medically stable [61].
Take a SAMPLE history for a medical patient [62].
Consider factors like central nervous system function [62].
Hallucinogens, drugs, or alcohol might be factors [62].
Significant life changes or illness could be non-physical [62].
Ask about a history of behavioral health illness [62].
In geriatric patients, consider Alzheimer's and dementia [63].
Identify the patient's baseline mental status [64].
Use reflective listening to understand the patient's thinking [65].
Reflective listening involves repeating what the patient tells you [176].
5. Management and Intervention Strategies
De-escalation Techniques
Establish a level of trust [17]
Be a good listener [79]
Use verbal de-escalation before physical restraint [115]
Communication is the key in behavioral health emergencies [16].
In some cases, patients will de-escalate [17].
This happens when a level of trust is established [17].
You cannot determine the cause of the crisis [17].
However, you may predict potential for violence [17].
The best treatment may be to be a good listener [79].
Intervene only as much as needed to accomplish tasks [79].
If pharmacological restraint might be necessary, request advanced life
support early [79].
Diffuse and control the situation [78].
6. Specific Behavioral Health Conditions
Psychosis is a state of delusion [83].
The person is out of touch with reality [83].
Affected people live in their own reality [83].
Causes of psychotic episodes include altered mind-altering substances [83].
Intense stress or delusional disorders can cause psychosis [83].
schizophrenia is also a cause of psychosis [83].
schizophrenia is a complex disorder [84].
It is not easily defined or treated [84].
Onset typically occurs during early adulthood [85].
Symptoms become more prominent over time [85].
Contributing influences include brain damage and genetics [86].
Physiologic and social influences also contribute [86].
Symptoms are delusions, hallucinations, and lack of pleasure [87].
Erratic speech is also a symptom [87].
When dealing with schizophrenia, determine if the situation is safe [87].
Clearly identify yourself [88].
Be calm, direct, and straightforward [88].
Maintain an emotional distance [88].
Do not argue with the patient [89].
Explain what you are going to do [89].
Involve people the patient trusts, like family [89].
This helps gain the patient's cooperation [89].
excited delirium is also known as agitated delirium [90].
It can also be called exhaustive mania [90].
Delirium is an impairment in cognitive function [91].
It can present with disorientation, hallucinations, or delusions [91].
Agitation is characterized by restlessness [92].
Irregular physical activity is a sign of agitation [92].
Symptoms of excited delirium include hyperactive, irrational behavior [93].
Vivid hallucinations are a symptom [93].
Hypertension, tachycardia, and diaphoresis can occur [93].
Dilated pupils are also a symptom [93].
If safe to approach, be calm, supportive, and empathetic [94].
Approach the patient slowly and purposefully [95].
Respect the patient's personal space [95].
Limit physical contact as much as possible [96].
Do not leave the patient unattended [96].
Use careful interviewing to assess cognitive functioning [97].
Determine the patient's ability to communicate [98].
Observe the patient's appearance, dress, and hygiene [99].
If overdose is suspected, take medicine bottles with you [100].
Transport to a hospital with a behavioral health facility [101].
Refrain from using lights and sirens [101].
If agitation continues, request advanced life support [102].
chemical restraints can be considered [102].
excited delirium can lead to sudden death from cardiac arrest [103].
This is thought to result from metabolic acidosis [103].
Physical control measures include tasers and stimulant drugs [104].
positional asphyxia is also a risk [104].
7. Patient Restraints: Considerations and Procedures
Risks of Improper Restraint
Positional asphyxia [111]
Aspiration [111]
Severe acidosis [111]
Cardiac arrest [111]
Pre-hospital patient restraints reduce injury possibility [104].
This protects the patient and EMS providers [104].
Restraints allow for safe treatment of uncooperative patients [105].
A pre-hospital patient restraint protocol should be followed [106].
The protocol should address appropriateness and types of restraint [107].
Care provided after restraint should be in the protocol [107].
Protocols must consider state laws [108].
Only approved restraint devices should be used [109].
The least restrictive method ensuring safety should be chosen [110].
There are risks associated with restraints [111].
Improper use can lead to life-threatening conditions [111].
These include positional asphyxia, aspiration, and severe acidosis [111].
Cardiac arrest is also a possibility [111].
Restraining without authority can result in legal actions [112].
Examples are assault, battery, or false imprisonment [112].
Violation of civil rights is also a risk [112].
Restraints are only to protect yourself and others from bodily harm [113].
They prevent the patient from injuring themselves [113].
Involve law enforcement for severe behavioral crises [114].
Use verbal de-escalation before physical restraint [115].
Once the decision to restrain is made, do it quickly [116].
Ideally, five people should be present for restraint [117].
One person for each extremity and one for the head is ideal [118].
A team leader should direct the process [119].
Use the minimum force necessary [119].
Force level depends on factors like patient size and strength [121].
The type of abnormal behavior also affects force needed [122].
Talk to the patient throughout the process [123].
Treat the patient with dignity and respect [124].
A provider of the same gender should tend the patient if possible [124].
Wear appropriate barrier protection [125].
Avoid direct eye contact until necessary [125].
Respect the patient's personal space [125].
Never leave a restrained patient unattended [126].
four-point restraints are preferred for uncooperative patients [126].
This means both arms and legs are restrained [126].
Respiratory and circulatory problems can occur in restrained patients [127].
Restraints should not be removed until evaluated at the hospital [128].
Follow skill drills for four-point restraint [129].
two-point restraint is an option if allowed by protocol [130].
Reassess and document respiration, pulse, motor, and sensory functions [77].
Do this every five minutes in restrained extremities [77].
8. Assessing Potential for Violence and Suicide Risk
Violent patients are a small percentage of behavioral crises [131].
Assess the danger level based on risk factors [132].
History is a risk factor for violence [132].
Has the patient been hostile or violent before? [132].
Posture can indicate danger [132].
Is the patient tense, rigid, or sitting on edge? [132].
The scene provides clues [132].
Is the patient near potentially lethal objects like a knife or gun? [132].
Vocal activity is a factor [132].
Is speech loud, obscene, erratic, or bizarre? [132].
Erratic speech patterns usually indicate emotional distress [132].
Physical activity may be the most telling factor [132].
A patient requiring watching has tense muscles or clenched fists [133].
Pacing or inability to sit still are signs [133].
Fiercely protecting personal space is a sign [133].
Poor muscle impulse control is a risk factor [133].
A history of fighting or uncontrollable temper is a risk [134].
Substance abuse history increases risk [134].
Depression accounts for 20 percent of violent acts [134].
A functional disorder can increase risk [134].
If a patient hears voices telling them to kill, believe them [135].
Depression is the most significant factor contributing to suicide [136].
It's a misconception that those who threaten suicide won't commit it [137].
Threatening suicide means someone is in crisis [138].
They cannot handle it alone [138].
Immediate intervention is necessary for suicidal patients [138].
Warning signs include sadness, despair, and hopelessness [139].
Appearing detached is a sign [139].
Inability to talk about the future is a sign [139].
Suggestions of suicide are warning signs [139].
Specific plans for suicide or death are major warnings [139].
Additional risk factors for suicide include unsafe objects nearby [141].
An unsafe environment is a risk [141].
Evidence of self-destructive behavior is a risk [141].
An immediate threat to the patient or others is a risk [141].
An underlying medical problem can increase risk [141].
Cultural, religious, and social beliefs promoting suicide are risks [141].
Trauma can increase suicide risk [141].
A suicidal patient may also be homicidal [141].
9. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) in Combat Veterans
Signs and Symptoms of PTSD
Helplessness [148]
Anxiety, anger, or fear [148]
Avoiding reminders of the trauma [148]
Constant nervous system arousal [148]
Increased heart rate [149]
Dilated pupils [149]
Increased systolic blood pressure [149]
Sharpened senses [150]
Heightened mental acuity [150]
Reliving trauma through thoughts, nightmares, or flashbacks [151]
Alcohol and drug use [152]
Increased risk of suicide [153]
Physical conditions related to injuries [153]
Unfocused pain [153]
Higher incidence of TBI [154]
PTSD can occur after trauma exposure or injury [143].
Examples include sexual or physical assault [144].
Child abuse or serious accidents are also causes [144].
Natural disasters, war, or loss of a loved one can cause PTSD [144].
A stressful life event can lead to PTSD [144].
PTSD is not always from a single recent event [145].
Estimated 7-8% of the general population experience PTSD [146].
Military personnel in combat have a high incidence of PTSD [147].
Signs include helplessness, anxiety, anger, or fear [148].
They frequently avoid trauma reminders [148].
They suffer constant nervous system arousal [148].
Heart rate and systolic blood pressure increase [149].
Pupils dilate [149].
Senses are sharpened and mental acuity heightened [150].
They often relive the trauma through flashbacks [151].
PTSD occurs when trying to escape internal distress [152].
Alcohol and drug use are common among veterans [152].
Veterans have an increased risk of suicide [153].
They may develop physical conditions related to combat injuries [153].
Unfocused pain not tied to a body part is possible [153].
Combat veterans have a higher incidence of TBI [154].
TBI is often from IED explosions [154].
Eliminate excess noise when caring for veterans [155].
Refrain from touching or doing anything without explanation [155].
Keep diesel equipment far away if possible [155].
Returning vets require understanding and compassion [156].
They need specialized attention [156].
Be careful how you phrase questions [157].
Use a calm tone but be in charge [157].
Respect a veteran's personal space [157].
Limit the number of people involved [157].
Move to a private and quiet space if possible [157].
Ask about suicidal intentions [157].
Military personnel are trained with weapons [158].
They are resourceful in improvising weapons [158].
Ensure no accessible objects can be used as weapons [159].
Physical restraint is ineffective with this population [160].
It may simply escalate the problem [160].
10. Medical-Legal Considerations
Medical-legal aspects are complicated in behavioral emergencies [161].
If a patient has impaired mental capacity, decide if they need emergency care
[162].
A mentally unstable patient may resist care [163].
Do not leave this patient alone [163].
Request law enforcement to handle the patient [164].
You need consent to provide care [165].
implied consent is assumed if the patient is not mentally competent [165].
Consent matters are not always clear-cut [165].
If unsure, request law enforcement assistance [166].
Guidance from medical control is also helpful [166].
EMTs have limited legal authority to force care [167].
This is true when no life-threatening emergency exists [167].
A competent adult can refuse treatment [168].
This is true even if life-saving care is involved [168].
In psychiatric cases, providing life-saving care is likely considered appropriate
[169].
An impaired patient may not be competent to refuse treatment [170].
Always maintain a high index of suspicion [171].
Assume the worst and hope for the best [171].
Error on the side of treatment and transport [171].
Carefully document patient statements and behaviors [171].
This supports your actions [171].
