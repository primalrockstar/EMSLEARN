1. Introduction to Pediatric Emergencies
Treating children is different from treating adults.
Children vary anatomically, physically, and emotionally from adults.
Their illnesses and injuries differ based on age and development.
pediatrics is the specialized medical practice for young patients.
Caring for children can be challenging due to their age and developmental level.
Children may not be able to describe what is wrong.
Fear of EMS providers and pain can make assessment difficult.
Parents or caregivers may be stressed or frightened.
2. Communication and Family Support
Caring for a child means caring for both the patient and caregivers.
Family members often need emotional support.
A calm parent helps the child remain calm.
Agitated parents can make a child's care more difficult.
Remaining calm, efficient, and professional is important.
For infants, the caregiver can hold the baby during assessment.
For toddlers, reassure them with simple words and a calm voice if a parent is
unavailable.
For preschool-aged children, communicate simply and directly.
Do not lie to a preschooler as it harms trust.
For school-aged children, talk to the child, not just the caregiver.
Give school-aged children simple explanations about pain.
Ask school-aged children's parents for distraction advice.
For adolescents, allow them to be involved in their own care.
Allow adolescents to speak openly and ask questions.
Maintain professional composure when dealing with sensitive issues like sexual abuse.
After a child's death, support the grieving family.
Learn and use the child's name.
Speak to the family at eye level and maintain contact.
Use the word "dead" or "died" when informing the family.
Acknowledge the family's feelings.
Offer to call family members.
Keep instructions short and simple.
Ask if family members want to hold the child.
Wrap the child in a blanket if the family holds them.
Do not remove tubes or equipment if the family is present.
3. Growth and Development Stages
Childhood extends from birth to age 18.
Children's thoughts and behaviors are grouped into five stages.
Stage Ages Key Considerations
Infancy First year Rapid growth; cannot differentiate strangers from parents;
crying is main expression. Relatively larger head predisposes
to hypothermia. Mobility increases danger. May cry if
separated from parents.
Toddler 1 to 3 years Rapid growth and development; explorers by nature,
increasing injuries. Lack of molars increases choking risk.
Stranger anxiety; may resist separation from caregiver.
Difficulty describing pain; use visual scales.
Preschool
Age
3 to 6 years Rich imagination; fearful about pain; may believe injury is
punishment. Can understand directions; describe painful
areas. Much history still from caregivers. Modesty
developing.
School Age 6 to 12
years
Begin to understand death is final. Assessment more like an
adult. Talk to the child; give simple explanations for pain.
Understand physical and emotional pain.
Adolescence 13 to 18
years
Physically similar to adults, emotionally still children. Time of
experimentation and risk behaviors. Can understand complex
concepts; allow involvement in care. Clear understanding of
pain.
4. Pediatric Anatomy and Physiology Differences
System Pediatric Characteristics Adult Comparison Source
Respiratory Smaller airway diameter and
length; smaller lungs. Heart
opening higher and more
anterior. Larger and rounder
occiput. Tongue larger relative
to mouth size and more
anterior. Long, flappy epiglottis.
Tracheal cartilage less
developed. Upper airway
funnel-shaped. Diameter of
trachea size of drinking straw.
Nose breathers. Oxygen
demand twice that of adults.
Diaphragm dictates air
inspiration. Gastric distension
hinders diaphragm movement.
Thinner chest walls. Less air
exchanged with each breath.
Airway is larger and
longer; lungs are larger.
Heart opening is lower.
Occiput is smaller and
flatter. Tongue is smaller
relative to mouth size
and less anterior.
Epiglottis is smaller and
less pliable. Tracheal
cartilage is more
developed and rigid.
Upper airway is
cylindrical. Trachea is
larger. Mouth breathers.
Oxygen demand is lower.
Other muscles assist in
breathing. Gastric
distension has less
impact on diaphragm.
Thicker chest walls.
More air exchanged with
each breath.
Circulatory Normal pulse ranges vary with
age. Heart rate 160+ in infants.
Compensate for decreased
perfusion by constricting skin
vessels. Signs of
vasoconstriction: pallor, weak
distal pulses, delayed cap refill,
cool hands/feet.
Heart rate is generally
lower and less variable.
Compensation
mechanisms differ.
Nervous Immature, underdeveloped, not
well protected.
Disproportionately larger head
to body ratio. Larger occipital
region. Smaller subarachnoid
space, less cushioning. Fragile
brain tissue and vasculature
prone to bleeding. Higher
requirement for cerebral blood
flow, oxygen, glucose. Higher
risk of secondary brain damage
from hypotension/hypoxia. SCI
less common. Ligament injuries
more likely in cervical spine.
Nervous system is
mature and wellprotected.
Head to body
ratio is proportionate.
Occipital region is
smaller. Subarachnoid
space is larger, providing
more cushioning. Brain
tissue and vasculature
are more robust. Lower
requirement for cerebral
blood flow, oxygen,
glucose. Lower risk of
secondary brain
damage. SCI is more
common with bony
injuries.
Gastrointestinal Abdominal muscles less
developed, less protection from
trauma. Liver, spleen, kidneys
proportionately larger and
more anterior, prone to
bleeding/injury.
Abdominal muscles are
more developed,
providing greater
protection. Liver, spleen,
kidneys are
proportionately smaller
and less anterior, less
prone to injury from
minimum direct impact.
Musculoskeletal Bones are softer; open growth
plates allow growth. Growth
plates are weak spots, prone to
stress fractures. Bone length
discrepancies can occur with
growth plate injury. Infant skull
Bones are harder;
growth plates are closed
after adolescence.
Bones are less flexible,

Thoracic cage is more
rigid (bone). Ribs/organs
are more protected by
muscle/fat.
Integumentary Skin thinner with less
subcutaneous fat. Burns more
deeply and easily with less
exposure. Higher body surface
area to body mass ratio leads
to greater fluid and heat loss.
Skin is thicker with more
subcutaneous fat. Burns
are generally less severe
for the same exposure.
Lower body surface area
to body mass ratio leads
to less fluid and heat
loss.
5. Patient Assessment Techniques
Assessment begins at dispatch.
Mentally prepare for approaching and treating a child.
Plan for pediatric scene size-up and equipment.
Gather information from dispatch like age, gender, location, MOI/NOI, and chief
complaint.
Note the patient's position.
Complete an environmental assessment for safety threats.
Use the pediatric assessment triangle (pat) to determine if the patient is sick.
The PAT takes less than 30 seconds to perform.
It requires no equipment.
The three elements of the PAT are Appearance, work of breathing, and Circulation.
Appearance assesses muscle tone and mental status.
Look at level of consciousness, interactiveness, and muscle tone.
The mnemonic TICKLES (Tone, Interactiveness, Consolability, Look or gaze,
Speech or cry) helps determine if a patient is sick.
work of breathing looks for signs of increased effort.
Signs include abnormal airway noise, accessory muscle use, retractions, head
bobbing, nasal flaring, tachypnea, and tripod position.
The body tries to compensate for oxygenation and ventilation problems.
Circulation to the skin assesses perfusion.
Pallor (pale skin) is seen in compensated shock, anemia, or hypoxia.
Mottling is another sign of poor perfusion.
Cyanosis indicates decreased blood oxygen.
From the PAT, decide if the patient is stable or unstable.
If unstable, assess ABCs, treat life threats, and transport immediately.
If stable, continue with the assessment process.
Perform necessary interventions and discuss transport options.
Perform a hands-on assessment following X-ABCs.
X is for exsanguination (life-threatening bleeding).
A is Airway: ensure it is open and clear. Position in the neutral sniffing position.
B is Breathing: Look, listen, and feel. Feel for chest rise and fall. Belly breathing is
adequate in infants.
C is Circulation: Determine pulse, bleeding, or shock. Palpate brachial or femoral
pulse in infants, carotid in older children. Assess skin temp and moisture, estimate
cap refill.
D is Disability: Use AVPU or pediatric GCS to assess level of consciousness. Check
pupil response and symmetrical movement.
E is Exposure: Remove clothing to observe face, chest wall, and skin. Keep infants
and young children warm to prevent hypothermia.
6. Transport Decisions and Considerations
If the pediatric patient is stable, obtain history and perform a secondary assessment at
the scene.
Transport and provide additional treatment as needed.
Rapid transport is indicated for specific conditions:
Significant mechanism of injury.
History of or capable of serious illness.
Physical abnormality noted during primary assessment.
Potentially serious anatomical abnormality or significant pain.
Abnormal level of consciousness or altered mental status.
Any signs or symptoms of shock.
Consider the type of problem, benefits of advanced life support, local protocols, and
your comfort level.
Transport time to the hospital is also a factor.
If the patient's condition is urgent, transport immediately to the closest facility.
Special facilities (trauma centers, children's hospitals) provide complete care.
The most appropriate facility is not always the closest.
Ask if you can deliver the patient to the most appropriate facility without risk or delay.
If not, transport to the closest facility.
Patients less than 40 pounds not requiring spinal immobilization should be transported
in a car seat.
Mount the car seat to the stretcher following manufacturer instructions.
Patients younger than two must be transported rear-facing due to immature neck
muscles.
For pediatric patients requiring spinal immobilization, use a long backboard or suitable
device.
Pediatric patients in cardiopulmonary arrest should be on a device that secures to the
stretcher.
Do not use the pediatric car seat for patients in cardiac arrest.
The goal is to secure and protect the patient during transport.
7. History Taking in Pediatric Patients
The approach to history taking depends on the child's age.
For infants, toddlers, and preschool-aged children, obtain history from the parent or
caregiver.
For adolescents, most information comes from the patient.
Ask adolescents about sexual activity, pregnancy, drugs, or alcohol in private.
Question about the immediate illness or injury based on the chief complaint.
When interviewing the caregiver or child about the chief complaint, obtain:
Mechanism of injury or nature of illness.
How long the patient has been sick or injured.
Key events leading to the illness or injury.
Presence of fever.
Effects on the child's behavior and activity level.
Recent eating, drinking, and urine output.
Change in bowel or bladder habits.
Presence of vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, or rashes.
Obtain the caregiver's name and phone number if they cannot go to the hospital.
Use the SAMPLE history, adapting questions to the patient's age and developmental
stage.
The process for obtaining OPQRST is the same as for adults.
OPQRST questions should also be based on the patient's age and developmental
stage.
8. Secondary Assessment and Physical Exam
A secondary assessment of the entire body is used when there is potential for hidden
illness or injuries.
It helps identify problems not obvious during the primary assessment.
Use the DCAP-BTLS mnemonic for the secondary assessment.
A focused assessment is performed on patients without life-threatening conditions.
For infants, toddlers, and preschool-aged children without life threats, assess from the
feet to the head.
For school-aged children and adolescents, use the head-to-toe approach like adults.
During the physical exam, examine specific areas:
Head: assess for bruising, DCAP-BTLS, and fontanelles in infants.
Nose: clear nasal congestion as it can cause respiratory distress.
Ears: look for drainage indicating skull fracture.
Mouth: check for bleeding or airway obstruction. Note breath smell for possible
diabetes.
Neck: look for tracheal deviation.
Chest: assess for DCAP-BTLS, listen and feel. Check clavicles.
Back: look for DCAP-BTLS.
Abdomen: inspect for distension, palpate for guarding, pain, tenderness. Look for
seat belt abrasions or bruising.
Extremities: check pms (Pulse, Motor, Sensation), look for symmetry, and range of
motion.
9. Vital Signs Assessment
Vital signs assess circulatory status but have limitations in pediatric patients.
Normal heart rates vary with age.
Blood pressure is usually not assessed in children younger than three.
Assessment of the skin is a better indicator of circulatory status.
Use appropriately sized equipment.
Use a blood pressure cuff covering two-thirds of the upper arm.
Systolic blood pressure for children 1-10 years old can be estimated as (Child's age in
years x 2) + 70.
Respiratory rates can be difficult to interpret.
Count respirations for at least 30 seconds and double it.
In infants and children younger than three, evaluate respirations by assessing
abdominal rise and fall.
Assess pulse rate by counting for at least a minute.
Note pulse quality and regularity.
Normal vital signs vary with age.

Assess vital signs in the order: Respirations, Pulse, Blood Pressure last.
Compare pupil size.
Pulse oximetry measures oxygen saturation.
Reassess vital signs every 15 minutes if stable, every 5 minutes if unstable.
Continually monitor respiratory effort, skin, and level of consciousness.
Parents or caregivers can assist by calming the child.
Communicate and document all information for emergency department personnel.
10. Respiratory Emergencies
Respiratory emergencies are the leading cause of cardiopulmonary arrest in children.
Failure to recognize and treat declining respiratory status leads to death.
Respiratory distress means the child is working harder to breathe.
If untreated, respiratory distress will progress to respiratory failure.
Early signs of respiratory distress include behavioral changes like combativeness,
restlessness, and anxiety.
Signs of increased work of breathing include nasal flaring, abnormal breath sounds,
accessory muscle use, and tripod position.
As respiratory failure progresses, breathing efforts decrease.
Chest rise lessens with inspiration.
The body has used up energy stores.
Behavioral changes occur, leading to altered consciousness.
Patients may have periods of apnea.
The heart rate slows due to hypoxic heart muscles.
Respiratory failure does not always indicate airway obstruction.
Other causes include trauma, nervous system problems, dehydration, or metabolic
disturbances.
A child's condition can worsen from distress to failure quickly.
Treatment for respiratory distress includes supplemental oxygen.
Assist ventilation with a bag valve mask (BVM) and 100% oxygen if needed.
Allow the patient to remain in a comfortable position.
11. Specific Respiratory Conditions
Asthma: smaller airway passages are inflamed and swell, producing mucus.
It is a true emergency if not treated promptly.
Causes include infection, exercise, cold air, smoke, and emotional stress.
Signs are wheezing, cyanosis, respiratory arrest, or tripod position.
Treatment: allow position of comfort, administer supplemental oxygen, administer
albuterol (with or without ipratropium) via MDI or nebulizer. Contact ALS and assist
ventilations if needed.
Pneumonia: an infection of the lungs, often secondary to a pre-existing infection.
Can also result from chemical ingestion, lung injury, or submersion.
Children with immunodeficiency are at increased risk.
Signs: rapid breathing, grunting or wheezing sounds, nasal flaring, tachypnea,
hypothermia or fever, diminished breath sounds or crackles.
Treatment is supportive: administer supplemental oxygen and bronchodilator if
wheezing.
Diagnosis is confirmed at the hospital.
Croup: infection of the airway below the vocal cords, usually viral.
Typically seen in children 6 months to 3 years.
Easily passed between children.
Starts with cold symptoms, cough, and low-grade fever.
Hallmark signs: stridor and a seal bark cough.
Responds well to oxygen or humidified oxygen.
Bronchodilators are not indicated and can worsen the condition.
Epiglottitis: infection of soft tissue above vocal cords, usually bacterial.
Incidence decreased with vaccination.
Epiglottis can swell significantly.
Children look ill, report sore throat, high fever.
Often in tripod position and drooling.
Bronchiolitis: viral infection (often RSV) causing inflammation of bronchioles.
Highly contagious.
More common in premature infants.
Results in copious secretions requiring suctioning.
Occurs in the first two years, more common in males.
Bronchioles inflame, swell, and fill with mucus.
Airways easily blocked.
Look for signs of dehydration, shortness of breath, fever.
Treatment: allow position of comfort, administer humidified oxygen, consider ALS
backup.
Pertussis (Whooping Cough): bacterial disease spread by respiratory droplets.
Less common due to vaccinations.
Starts like a common cold (sneezing, runny nose).
Progresses to severe coughing with a distinctive whoop sound on inspiration.
Infants may develop pneumonia or respiratory failure.
Treatment: keep airway open, transport. Follow standard precautions (mask, eye
protection).
12. Airway Adjuncts and Oxygen Delivery
Airway adjuncts help maintain the airway or assist ventilation.
These include OPAs, NPAs, bite blocks, and BVM devices.
Oral Pharyngeal Airway (OPA): keeps tongue from blocking airway, makes suctioning
easier.
Use in unconscious patients in possible respiratory failure.
Do not use in conscious patients, those with a gag reflex, or who ingested
caustic/petroleum products.
Nasal Pharyngeal Airway (NPA): usually well tolerated, less likely to cause vomiting.
Used in responsive patients with possible respiratory failure.
Rarely used in infants younger than one year.
Do not use in patients with nasal obstruction or head trauma.
Potential problems with airway adjuncts:
Small diameter airway can obstruct with mucus, blood, vomit.
Airway too long can stimulate vagal nerve (slow heart rate) or enter esophagus
(gastric distension).
Can cause laryngeal spasm and vomiting if inserted into responsive patient.
NPA should not be used with facial trauma due to bleeding risk.
Oxygen delivery devices:
Blow-by technique: provides >21% oxygen at 6 L/min. Not as effective as
mask/cannula, but better than none.
Nasal cannula: provides 24-44% oxygen at 1-6 L/min. Some children prefer it.
Non-rebreather mask: delivers up to 95% oxygen at 10-15 L/min. Patient exhales
CO2 without rebreathing it.
Bag-Valve Mask (BVM): provides nearly 100% oxygen at 10-15 L/min.
Non-rebreather, nasal cannula, or simple face mask are for patients with adequate
respirations.
Patients with respirations fewer than 12 or more than 60, altered consciousness, or
inadequate tidal volume need assisted ventilations with a BVM.
BVM is indicated for patients with respirations too slow or too fast, unresponsive, or
not responding purposefully to pain.
Two-person BVM is similar to one-person, but one holds the mask and the other
ventilates. It is usually more effective for maintaining a tight seal.
13. Cardiopulmonary Arrest and Shock
Cardiopulmonary arrest in children is most often associated with respiratory arrest.
Children are affected differently by decreasing oxygen than adults.
Focus on effective CPR, early use of an AED, and transport.
Shock develops when the circulatory system cannot deliver enough blood to vital
organs.
It results in organ failure and cardiopulmonary arrest.
Compensated shock is the early stage where the body compensates.
Decompensated shock is the later stage where blood pressure falls.
Common causes of shock in children: traumatic injury, dehydration, severe infection,
neurologic injury, anaphylaxis, heart disease, tension pneumothorax, blood around the
heart.
Children respond to fluid loss differently than adults.
They may increase heart rate and respirations, show pale or blue skin.
Signs of shock in children: tachycardia, poor capillary refill (>2 seconds), mental
status change.
Begin treating shock by assessing ABCs and intervening.
If obvious life-threatening external hemorrhage, the order is CAB (Circulation, Airway,
Breathing).
If cardiac arrest is suspected, the order is also CAB for chest compressions.
Children in shock often have increased respirations but blood pressure falls only in
severe shock.
Limit management to simple interventions.
Ensure airway is open, prepare for artificial ventilation, control bleeding.
Give supplemental oxygen by mask or blow-by.
Keep the patient warm.
Provide rapid transport to the nearest appropriate facility.
Contact ALS backup as needed.
14. Anaphylaxis and Bleeding Disorders
Anaphylaxis: a life-threatening allergic reaction involving multiple body systems.
Characterized by airway swelling and blood vessel dilation.
Common causes: insect stings, medications, food.
Signs and symptoms: hypoperfusion, stridor, wheezing, increased work of
breathing, restlessness, agitation, sense of impending doom, hives.
Treatment: keep the patient calm, administer oxygen, assist parent with prescribed
Epi auto-injector. Provide rapid transport.
Hemophilia: a congenital condition where the patient lacks normal clotting factors.
Mostly hereditary and severe.
Predominantly in males.
Bleeding may occur spontaneously.
All injuries become serious due to blood loss as blood does not clot.
Transport immediately.
Do not delay applying tourniquets for life-threatening hemorrhage.
15. Neurologic Emergencies
Use the AEIOU-TIPS mnemonic for major causes of altered mental status.
Understand normal developmental and age-related changes in behavior.
Listen carefully to the caregiver's opinion.
Signs and symptoms of altered mental status vary from confusion to coma.
Management focuses on ABCs.
Seizures: disorganized electrical activity in the brain.
Subtle in infants (sucking, bicycling movements).
More obvious in older children (repetitive muscle contractions, unresponsiveness).
Common causes are listed on a slide.
After a seizure, muscles relax, becoming flaccid.
Breathing is labored during the post-ictal state.
The post-ictal state is over when the child regains normal consciousness.
Status epilepticus is seizures every few minutes without regaining consciousness
or lasting over 30 minutes.
Recurring or prolonged seizures are potentially life-threatening.
If seizing or unconscious, protect the patient from harm and call for ALS.
Management: Protect the airway (top priority). Place in recovery position if
vomiting, have suction ready. Provide 100% oxygen (non-rebreather or blow-by).
Begin BVM ventilations if no improvement. Monitor breathing and consciousness.
Transport to appropriate facility.
Meningitis: inflammation of the tissues covering the spinal cord and brain.
Recognizing it in children is important.
Risk factors: males, newborns, compromised immune systems, history of
brain/spinal cord/back surgery, head trauma, shunts/pins/foreign bodies in
brain/spinal cord.
Signs and symptoms vary by age.
Common symptoms in all ages: fever, altered level of consciousness.
Seizure may be the first sign.
Infants <2-3 months may have apnea, cyanosis, fever, high-pitched cry,
hypothermia.
Meningeal irritation causes pain with movement, often a stiff neck.
Infant sign: increasing irritability and bulging fontanelle without crying.
Bacterial meningitis can have rapid onset, leading to shock and death.
Bacterial meningitis signs: small, pinpoint cherry red spots or larger purple-black
rash.
Suspected meningitis patients are considered contagious.
Follow standard precautions. Follow up on diagnosis for possible antibiotics if
exposed.
Treatment: give oxygen, assist ventilations if needed. Reassess vital signs
frequently. Transport to the highest level of service.
16. Gastrointestinal Emergencies
Never take a complaint of abdominal pain lightly.
Significant bleeding can occur internally without outward signs of shock.
Monitor for signs and symptoms of shock.
Gastrointestinal complaints are common in children.
Common causes: ingestion of certain foods or substances.
Symptoms: abdominal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.
Vomiting and diarrhea can cause dehydration.
If appendicitis is suspected, promptly transport to the hospital.
Obtain history from the caregiver, especially regarding:
Number of wet diapers.
Tolerance of liquids.
Frequency of diarrhea.
Presence of tears when crying.
17. Poisoning Emergencies
Poisonings are common in children.
Occur via ingestion, inhalation, injection, or absorption.
Common sources: alcohol, aspirin, cosmetics, cleaning products (bleach), plants, iron,
prescription/illicit drugs, vitamins.
Signs and symptoms vary widely based on substance, age, and weight.
Child can appear normal initially or be confused, sleepy, or unconscious.
Some substances are lethal with just one pill in a small child.
Infants can be poisoned by siblings, parents, or caregivers; be alert for abuse.
May be exposed in settings where harmful substances are smoked.
After primary assessment, ask the patient or caregiver:
What substance was involved?.
Approximately how much and how long ago?.
Any changes in behavior or consciousness?.
Any choking or coughing after exposure?.
Contact medical control for assistance in identifying poisons and treatment.
Perform external decontamination.
Assess ABCs and monitor breathing.
Provide oxygen and ventilations if necessary.
If signs of shock, position supine, keep warm, and transport.
May give activated charcoal per medical control or protocol.
18. Dehydration and Fever Emergencies
Dehydration: fluid loss is greater than intake.
Most common causes: vomiting and diarrhea.
If untreated, can lead to shock and death.
Infants and children are at greater risk due to smaller fluid reserves.
Life-threatening dehydration can occur in hours in infants.
Signs of mild dehydration: dry lips, decreased saliva, few wet diapers.
Signs of moderate dehydration: sunken eyes, sleepiness, irritability, loose skin,
sunken fontanelles.
Signs of severe dehydration: mottled, cool, clammy skin, delayed cap refill,
increased respirations.
Management: Assess ABCs. ALS backup is necessary for severe dehydration.
Transport all patients with moderate or severe dehydration.
Fever: increase in body temperature, usually from infection.
Temperatures 100.4°F or higher are abnormal.
Rarely life-threatening alone, but fever with a rash can indicate serious conditions
like meningitis.
Common causes: infection, status epilepticus, cancer, drug ingestion (aspirin),
arthritis, systemic lupus, high environmental temperatures.
Result of increased heat generation and decreased heat loss.
Accurate body temp is important.
Rectal temperature is most accurate for infants and toddlers.
Signs may include respiratory distress, shock, stiff neck, rash, hot skin, flushed
cheeks, seizures, bulging fontanelles (infants).
Assess for other signs/symptoms.
Provide rapid transport and management.
Follow standard precautions if communicable disease suspected.
Febrile seizures: common in children 6 months to 6 years, caused by fever alone.
Typically occur on the first day of a febrile illness.
Characterized by generalized tonic-clonic seizure activity.
Usually last fewer than 15 minutes with little or no post-ictal state.
May indicate a more serious problem like meningitis.
Management: Assess ABCs, provide cooling measures.
All patients with febrile seizures need to be seen at the hospital.
19. Drowning Emergencies
Drowning is the second most common cause of unintentional death in children 1-4
years.
Children can drown in pools, lakes, bathtubs, puddles, or buckets.
Older adolescents drown while swimming or boating; alcohol can be a factor.
The primary result is lack of oxygen.
Lack of oxygen affects heart, lungs, and brain even in minutes.
Submersion in icy water can cause hypothermia.
Diving increases the risk of neck and spinal cord injuries.
Signs and symptoms vary by submersion time.
Symptoms: coughing, choking, difficulty breathing, altered mental status, seizure,
unresponsiveness.
Management: request ALS, assess and manage ABCs. Administer oxygen or BVM. If
trauma suspected, apply cervical collar and backboard.
20. Pediatric Trauma Emergencies
Unintentional injuries are the number one killer of children.
Quality of care after injury greatly impacts recovery chances.
Children's muscles and bones are still growing.
Adolescents are prone to extremity fractures.
Femur fractures are rare but cause major blood loss.
Children's bones and soft tissues are less developed, affecting how force impacts
them.
Child's head is proportionately larger, exerting more stress on neck during deceleration
injury.
Children are often injured due to underdeveloped judgment and lack of experience.
Always assume serious neck or head injuries in vehicle collisions.
Injury area depends on child's height and bumper position.
Sports injuries are common; immobilize the cervical spine for sports-related injuries.
Head injuries are common due to head-to-body ratio.
Infant skull is softer and thinner, increasing brain tissue injury risk.
Scalp and facial vessels bleed easily, causing significant blood loss.
Nausea and vomiting are common signs.
Immobilization is necessary for possible head or spine injury after trauma.
Immobilization can be difficult due to body proportions.
Chest injuries are often due to blunt rather than penetrating trauma.
Flexible chest can cause flail chest without external signs.
Significant internal chest injuries may be present.
Abdominal injuries are common.
Monitor for shock.
Prevent hypothermia by keeping warm with blankets.
If low pulse, ventilate and monitor during transport.
Monitor all children with abdominal injuries for shock.
Burns are generally more serious than in adults.
Higher surface area to mass ratio increases shock risk, hypothermia risk, and
airway problems.
Common causes: hot substances (scalding water, stove), caustic substances
(cleaners, paint thinners).
Older children burned by flames.
Infection is common; use sterile techniques.
Consider abuse in any burn situation and report suspicions.
Severity: minor (partial thickness <10%), moderate (partial thickness 10-20%),
severe (full thickness any %; partial thickness >20%; any burn to hands, feet, face,
airway, genitalia).
Management is the same as adults.
Extremity injuries: bones are immature with active growth centers (growth plates).
Growth plates are potential weak spots.
Incomplete or greenstick fractures can occur.
Management is generally the same as adults.
21. Pain Management
The first step is recognizing that the patient is in pain.
Use visual clues and the Wong-Baker FACES Pain Scale as some children use nonverbal
or limited vocabulary.
Pain interventions are limited:
Positioning.
Ice packs.
Extremity evaluation.
These interventions decrease pain and swelling.
Kindness and emotional support are important tools.
22. Disaster Management (Jumpstart Triage)
Use the Jumpstart triage system instead of START triage for pediatric patients.
Intended for patients younger than 8 or appearing to weigh less than 100 pounds.
Four triage categories, designated by colors:
Green: Minor, not an immediate need for treatment. Able to walk (except infants).
Yellow: Delayed, spontaneous breathing, peripheral pulses, responsive to painful
stimuli.
Red: Immediate, apnea and respiratory failure, breathing but without a pulse,
inappropriate response to painful stimuli.
Black: Apnea without a pulse, or apnea and unresponsive to rescue breathing.
23. Child Abuse and Neglect
Child abuse: improper or excessive action that harms a child or infant.
Includes physical abuse, sexual abuse, neglect, and emotional abuse.
Over half a million child abuse victims annually.
Many suffer life-threatening conditions or die.
You must report suspected child abuse.
Abuse is likely to reoccur, potentially causing permanent injury or death.
Abuse occurs in every socio-economic status.
Be aware of the surroundings and document findings objectively.
You may testify in abuse cases, making accurate records essential.
Ask yourself questions to identify potential abuse:
Is the injury typical for the child's developmental level?.
Is the reported mechanism of injury consistent?.
Is the parent or caregiver behaving appropriately?.
Is there evidence of drinking or drug abuse at the scene?.
Was there a delay in seeking help?.
Is there a good relationship between caregiver and child?.
Does the child have multiple injuries in different healing stages?.
Does the child have unusual marks (cigarettes, heating, branding)?.
Does the child have several types of injuries?.
Are there burns on hands/feet with a glove distribution?.
Unexpected decreased level of consciousness?.
Is the child clean and appropriate weight?.
Any rectal or vaginal bleeding?.
What is the condition of the home (clean, dirty, warm, cold, food)?.
The mnemonic CHILD ABUSE helps remember points to look for.
Child abuse (the mnemonic itself).
History inconsistencies.
Injuries: multiple types or stages.
Lack of concern from caregiver.
Delay in seeking care.
Bruises: note color and location; suspicious on back, buttocks, face (usually inflicted).
Burns: suspicious on penis, testicles, vagina, buttocks (usually inflicted). Burns
encircling hand or foot (glove distribution) are suspicious. Suspect abuse with
cigarette burns or grid pattern burns.
Fractures: humerus or femur fractures without major trauma are suspicious. Falls out
of bed usually don't cause fractures. Maintain suspicion for femur or complete fracture
in infants/young children.
Shaken baby syndrome: life-threatening head trauma from shaking or head impact.
Bleeding in head, cervical spine damage from shaking.
Neglect: refusal or failure to provide necessities. Neglected children are often dirty,
thin, developmentally delayed.
Behavioral indicators: withdrawn, fearful, or hostile children. Be concerned if a child
avoids discussing injury cause. Alert for conflicting stories or lack of caregiver concern.
Abuser can be parent, caregiver, relative, or friend.
EMTs in all states must report suspected abuse. Most states have special forms.
Supervisors are generally forbidden from interfering with reporting.
Law enforcement and child protective services determine if abuse occurred.
Sexual abuse: victims can be any age or gender. Maintain a high index of suspicion.
Assessment limited to determining dressing needs for injuries (bruises, fractures). Do
not examine genitalia unless bleeding is evident.
Do not allow child or EMT to wash, urinate, or defecate.
Ensure same-gender EMT or police officer stays with the child.
Maintain professional composure.
Obtain as much information as possible.
Transport all child victims; sexual abuse is a crime.
24. Sudden Unexpected Infant Death Syndrome (SUIDS/SIDS)
Sudden unexpected infant death (SUID): sudden death where cause is unknown until
investigation.
One cause of SUID is Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), death unexplained by
another cause.
About 3,500 infants die of SIDS annually.
Recommendations to reduce SIDS risk: place baby on their back in a crib free of
bumpers, blankets, toys.
Have baby sleep in the same room, but not the same bed.
Breastfeeding and pacifier use are associated with lower risk.
SIDS risk factors (impossible to predict): mother <20, mothers who smoke, use alcohol
or drugs, low birth weight.
SIDS can occur at any time of day.
EMT tasks in SIDS cases: scene assessment, patient assessment/management,
communication/support for family.
Patient assessment for a SIDS victim: blue, pale, not breathing, unresponsive.
Other potential causes to consider: infection, child abuse, airway obstruction,
meningitis, accidental poisoning, hypoglycemia, metabolic defects.
Begin assessment with XABCs. Provide interventions as needed.
If signs of postmortem changes are present (depending on time passed), call medical
control.
If no postmortem changes, begin CPR immediately.
Note any marks or bruises on the child before procedures.
Document any interventions not done prior to your arrival.
Scene assessment: inspect the environment, noting conditions where found.
Concentrate on signs of illness (medications, humidifiers, thermometers), house
condition, hygiene, family interaction, and where infant was discovered.
Communication and support for the family after death: a devastating event evoking
strong emotions in healthcare providers.
Follow or allow the family to express grief. Offer empathy and understanding.
Family may want resuscitation attempts conflicting with protocols.
Introduce yourself, ask date of birth and history.
Do not speculate on the cause of death.
Ask if they want to hold the child and say goodbye.
Helpful interventions: use child's name, speak at eye level, maintain contact.
Use "dead" or "died", not euphemisms.
Acknowledge feelings, offer to call family.
Keep instructions short and basic. Ask each family member individually if they want to
hold the child.
Wrap the child in a blanket and stay with them.
Each culture expresses grief differently. Some require intervention.
Most caregivers feel responsible for the death.
Some EMS systems arrange home visits for closure, requiring special training.
Child's death is stressful for providers. Take time off, talk to colleagues. Be alert for
PTSD signs in self/others, consider professional help.
25. Apparent Life-Threatening Events (ALTES)
Infants found not breathing, cyanotic, or unresponsive may resume breathing/color
with stimulation.
This is an Apparent Life-Threatening Event (ALTE).
Characteristics: cyanosis, apnea, distinct change in muscle tone, choking, or gagging.
After the event, the child may appear healthy with no signs of illness or distress.
Management: strict attention to airway management.
Assess the infant's history.
Allow caregivers to ride in the back.
Physicians will determine the cause of this brief, unexplained event.
Signs and symptoms include brief color changes (pale or cyanosis), choking,
absent/low/irregular breathing, abnormal muscle tone, decreased consciousness, no
abnormality on assessment.
Transport is required for evaluation.
