Report on Geriatric Emergencies
1. Introduction to Geriatric Emergencies and the Aging Process
Year Projected Population Aged 65+ (Millions)
2012
geriatrics focuses on the assessment and treatment of disease in individuals aged
65 or older . The population aged 65 and older is projected to nearly double between
2012 and 2050 . Caring for geriatric patients presents unique challenges due to
chronic conditions, multiple medications, and the physiological changes of aging .
Human growth and development peak in the late 20s and early 30s, after which the
aging process begins . This process is inevitable and includes changes in
physiological functions, like a decline in liver and kidney function . All body tissues
age, and the decrease in functional capacity of organ systems is normal, impacting
how a patient responds to illness .
2. Communication and Generational Considerations in Geriatric
Care
Understanding and appreciating the life of an older person is important . It requires
time and patience to interact with older individuals . Always treat patients with
respect and avoid ageism, the stereotyping that can lead to discrimination . Older
people can remain fit and active, though not at the same level as in their youth .
Effective verbal communication is essential for successful assessment and
treatment . Communication can be challenging due to conditions like dementia .
When caring for older individuals, use their name or "sir" or "ma'am".
Ask how they prefer to be addressed to build trust.
Identify yourself and be aware of your presentation.
Look directly at the patient at eye level in good lighting.
Speak slowly and distinctly.
Have one person talk to the patient, asking one question at a time.
Do not assume all older patients have hearing loss.
Give the patient time to respond, unless urgent.
Listen to the answer they provide.
Explain actions before performing them.
Avoid talking about the patient as if they are not present.
3. Common Complaints and Leading Causes of Death in Older
Adults
Changing physiology predisposes geriatric patients to unique problems . Simple
injuries can have severe consequences .
Common Conditions Leading Causes of Death
Chronic Lower Respiratory Disease
Influenza
Pneumonia
Heart Disease
Cancer
Stroke
Alzheimer's Disease
Diabetes
Accidents/Falls
A simple rib fracture in an 80 or 90-year-old can lead to pneumonia or death . Hip
fractures from low-mechanism falls are common with dire consequences . Hip
fractures are more likely with weakened bones due to osteoporosis or infection .
Sedentary behavior during healing can predispose patients to pneumonia and blood
clots . Many older people do not return to their pre-injury activity level after a hip
fracture .
4. Age-Related Changes in the Respiratory System
Age-related changes in the respiratory system increase susceptibility to illness .
Airway musculature weakening can decrease breathing capacity . Alveoli may
enlarge, losing elasticity and making air expulsion difficult . Slower chemoreceptors
cause a delayed response to hypoxia . Loss of protective airway mechanisms
includes decreased cough and gag reflexes .
Pneumonia is a leading cause of death from infection in older Americans.
Aging causes immune suppression, increasing infection risk.
Increased mucus, secretions, and inflammation interfere with oxygenating
blood.
Management is the same as for other patients.
Maintain high suspicion for geriatric patients with pneumonia signs.
pulmonary emboli are sudden blockages by venous clots.
Patients may have shortness of breath and chest pain.
It can be confused with cardiac, lung, or musculoskeletal issues.
Risk factors include nursing home residence, hospitalization, trauma,
cancer, blood clot history, heart failure, pacemaker, paralyzed extremities,
obesity, smoking, or recent long-distance travel.
Symptoms include tachycardia, sudden dyspnea, shoulder/back/chest
pain, cough, syncope (with larger clots), anxiety, apprehension, low-grade
fever, leg pain, redness, unilateral pedal edema, fatigue, and cardiac
arrest.
Treatment focuses on airway, ventilatory, and circulatory support.
Supplemental oxygen and ventilation may be needed.
5. Age-Related Changes in the Cardiovascular System
Signs/Symptoms Older Adults Younger
Adults
Myocardial Infarction Often silent or atypical Classic chest
pain
Heart Failure (Right-
Sided)
Jugular vein distension, ascites,
peripheral edema, enlarged liver
Heart Failure (Left-
Sided)
Pulmonary edema, shortness of breath,
crackles, proximal nocturnal dyspnea
The heart hypertrophies with age, possibly due to stiffening blood vessels . Cardiac
output declines over time due to decreasing stroke volume . Arteriosclerosis
contributes to systolic hypertension, burdening the heart . The ability to speed up
contractions, increase strength, and constrict vessels decreases with stiffer vessels .
Atherosclerosis is the buildup of fat and cholesterol in arteries.
Older people are at increased risk for aneurysms. Severe blood loss can
occur if an aneurysm ruptures.
Stiff blood vessels result in higher systolic blood pressure. Stiffening and
degeneration of heart valves may impede blood flow.
Changes in the heart's electrical conduction system can lead to abnormal rate
or rhythm.
orthostatic hypotension is a blood pressure drop with position change. The
body adapts less to rapid postural changes.
venous stasis can cause clots, leading to deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary
emboli. Loss of proper vein function in the legs also occurs.
Myocardial infarcts (heart attacks) often lack classic symptoms in geriatrics.
Up to one-third of older patients have silent heart attacks. This is more
common in women and patients with diabetes. Atypical signs include
epigastric/abdominal pain, loss of bowel/bladder control, nausea, vomiting,
weakness, dizziness, lightheadedness, syncope, fatigue, and confusion.
Other signs include diaphoresis, pale/cyanotic/mottled skin, abnormal breath
sounds, and increased peripheral edema. Treatment involves airway,
ventilatory, and circulatory support, aspirin, and assisting with nitroglycerin.
Heart failure symptoms vary based on the affected side. Right-sided failure
shows fluid backup in the body (jugular vein distension, ascites, peripheral
edema). Left-sided failure causes fluid in the lungs (pulmonary edema,
shortness of breath, crackles). Proximal nocturnal dyspnea is sudden
respiratory distress waking a person at night due to fluid accumulation in the
lungs. Symptoms include coughing, suffocation feeling, cold sweats, and
tachycardia. Treatment is airway, ventilatory, and circulatory support.
6. Stroke in the Geriatric Population
Stroke is a leading cause of death in older people . Preventable risk factors include
smoking, hypertension, diabetes, Afib, obesity, and a sedentary lifestyle .
Uncontrollable factors include age, race, and gender .
Signs and symptoms include altered level of consciousness, one-sided
numbness, weakness, or paralysis. Other signs are slurred speech, aphasia,
visual disturbances, headache, dizziness, incontinence, and potentially
seizures.
Hemorrhagic strokes involve bleeding into the brain from broken vessels;
they are less common but more fatal.
Ischemic strokes occur when blood clots block blood flow to part of the
brain.
Determining the onset of symptoms is important. Patients with symptom
onset within a few hours might be candidates for stroke center therapy.
A transient ischemic attack (TIA) can have the same symptoms as a stroke.
Always manage the patient as if they are having a stroke.
7. Age-Related Changes in the Nervous System
Sense Age-Related Changes Impact
Vision Decline in acuity, depth
perception, light accommodation
Increased likelihood of falls and
medication errors
Hearing Difficulty hearing high
frequencies, balance problems
Falls more likely
Taste Diminished sense of taste Lessened interest in eating,
weight loss, malnutrition, fatigue
Touch Decreased sense of touch and
pain perception
May not know if injured
Normal findings in older people include changes in thinking speed, memory, and
posture stability . The brain decreases in weight and volume with age, increasing
space in the cranium and the risk of head injuries . There is a loss of neurons that
affects control of breathing, heart rate, blood pressure, hunger, thirst, and body
temperature . Performance of most sense organs declines with age .
Vision changes include cataracts, which interfere with vision, making it hard
to distinguish colors and see clearly. Decreased tear production leads to drier
eyes. Older people may have difficulty differentiating colors and decreased
night vision. Presbyopia, the inability to see up close, is caused by less lens
elasticity. Other diseases affecting vision include glaucoma, macular
degeneration, and retinal detachment.
Hearing changes in the inner ear make high-frequency sounds difficult to
hear. Ear changes can also cause balance problems, increasing fall risk.
Heredity and noise exposure contribute to hearing loss. Check for hearing aid
use during assessment.
The sense of taste diminishes due to decreased taste buds, potentially
leading to less interest in eating, weight loss, malnutrition, and fatigue.
A decreased sense of touch and pain perception from nerve fiber loss means
an injured person may not realize it. Decreased sensation of hot and cold also
occurs.
dementia is a chronic, generally irreversible condition with slow onset,
progressive disorientation, shortened attention span, and loss of cognitive
function. Causes include Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, stroke, and genetic factors.
Patients may show loss of cognitive function, memory problems, decreased
attention span, decreased communication ability, and confusion.
delirium is a sudden change in mental status, consciousness, or cognitive
processes. It is marked by inability to focus, think logically, and maintain
attention. It affects a significant percentage of hospitalized older adults. It is
usually caused by reversible physical ailments like fever or metabolic causes.
Look for histories of intoxication/withdrawal, UTIs, bowel obstruction,
dehydration, fever, cardiovascular disease, hyperglycemia/hypoglycemia,
depression, malnutrition, and environmental emergencies. Assess for hypoxia,
hypovolemia, hypoglycemia, and hypothermia. Changes in circulation, breath
sounds, motor function, and pupillary response may be seen.
Syncope should always be assumed to be an underlying life-threatening
problem until proven otherwise. It is often caused by interrupted blood flow to
the brain.
neuropathy is a disorder of the peripheral nervous system nerves, impairing
their function and structure. Symptoms depend on the affected nerves
(motor, sensory, autonomic) and their location.
8. Age-Related Changes in the Gastrointestinal and Renal
Systems
Changes in the gastrointestinal system affect digestion . Reduced saliva volume
causes mouth dryness . Dental loss is widespread, contributing to nutritional and
digestive problems . Gastric secretions are reduced . Changes in gastric mobility lead
to slower emptying . The incidence of certain bowel diseases increases with age .
Blood flow to the liver declines, decreasing enzyme activity and metabolism . This
affects how medications impact patients .
Poor muscular tone of sphincters can lead to regurgitation, heartburn, and
acid reflux. The rectal sphincter also weakens.
GI bleeding is common. Causes include inflammation, infection, and
obstruction. Hematemesis (vomiting blood) is seen with upper GI bleeding.
melena (black, tarry stools) usually indicates bleeding in the lower tract. Red
blood often signifies a local source like hemorrhoids. Patients may experience
weakness, dizziness, or syncope with GI bleeding. GI bleeding can be lifethreatening.
Specific common GI problems include diverticulitis, bleeding in the
upper/lower GI system, peptic ulcer disease, gallbladder disease, or a bowel
obstruction. Ask about NSAID and alcohol use. Orthostatic vital signs can help
determine hypovolemia. Treatment includes airway, ventilatory, and
circulatory support.
Acute abdomen complaints in the pre-hospital setting pose the threat of
blood loss, leading to shock and death. Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a
rapidly fatal condition.
Age-related changes in the renal system include reduced function and blood flow .
Kidney weight decreases, leading to a loss of functioning filtering surface . Renal
blood flow can decrease by 50% . Acute illnesses in older patients often involve
electrolyte imbalance due to a markedly decreased thirst mechanism . This can
cause rapid and severe dehydration .
Incontinence is not a normal part of aging and can cause skin irritation,
breakdown, and UTIs. Bladder capacity decreases with age.
stress incontinence occurs during activities like coughing, laughing,
sneezing, lifting, and exercise.
urge incontinence is triggered by fluids, running water, or thinking about
the bathroom.
Urinary retention, or difficulty urinating, is the opposite of incontinence. An
enlarged prostate (benign prostate hypertrophy) in men can pressure the
urethra, making voiding difficult.
Bladder and urinary tract infections can cause inflammation. Severe urinary
retention can lead to renal failure.
9. Age-Related Changes in the Endocrine and Immune Systems
A significant change in older persons is a decrease in metabolism . This affects the
body's metabolism, temperature, growth, and heart rate . Symptoms attributed to
this include slower heart rate, fatigue, drier skin/hair, cold intolerance, and weight
gain . Increased secretion of antidiuretic hormone can cause fluid imbalance .
Hyperglycemia and increased norepinephrine levels may harm the cardiovascular
system .
Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic nonketotic syndrome (hhns) is a diabetic
complication more common in type 2 diabetes. hhns and diabetic
ketoacidosis (DKA) symptoms often overlap. Symptoms include
hyperglycemia, polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, dizziness, confusion, altered
mental status, and possibly seizures. Changes in circulation may include
warm, flushed skin, poor skin turgor, pale/dry oral mucosa, and a furrowed
tongue. Patients may show hypotension and shock signs like tachycardia.
Blood glucose is typically 600 or higher in hhns, while it varies in DKA. DKA
presents with Kussmaul's respirations; hhns does not. Treatment includes
airway, ventilatory, and circulatory support.
Older people's immune systems may be weakened . They may not develop a fever;
hypothermia can indicate severe systemic infection . Anorexia, fatigue, weight loss,
falls, or changes in mental status may be the primary symptom of infection .
Pneumonia and UTIs are common in bedridden patients . When infection occurs,
signs and symptoms may be decreased or minimized .
10. Age-Related Changes in the Musculoskeletal and Skin
Systems
Common Musculoskeletal
Conditions
Description
Osteoporosis Decrease in bone mass and strength, leading to
fractures
Osteoarthritis Progressive joint disease destroying cartilage,
forming bone spurs, causing stiffness
Aging leads to a widespread decrease in bone mass, especially in postmenopausal
women . Bones become more brittle and break more easily . Spinal discs narrow,
causing a decrease in height and changes in posture . Joints lose flexibility and may
be immobilized by arthritis . Decreased motion and muscle mass result in less
strength . Changes in physical abilities can affect confidence in mobility . The muscle
system atrophies and weakens, strength declines . Joint ligaments and cartilage lose
elasticity, and cartilage degenerates . Stooped posture comes from atrophy of
supporting structures and kyphosis (forward curling of the spine) .
osteoporosis makes patients more susceptible to fractures. Bone loss is
influenced by genetics, smoking, activity level, diet, alcohol consumption,
hormonal factors, and body weight.
Osteoarthritis affects joints like hands, knees, hips, and spine. Patients
complain of pain and stiffness that worsens with exertion.
Changes also occur in the skin . Proteins that make skin pliable decline . The fat layer
under the skin becomes thinner . Bruising is more common because skin tears easily .
Sweat glands respond less readily to heat due to atrophy .
Pressure ulcers, or bedsores, develop when pressure cuts off blood flow to
skin areas. Padding under bony areas and in voids prevents these ulcers.
Ulcers have various stages. They can be painful and cause complications like
bleeding, sepsis, and bone inflammation.
11. Toxicology and Polypharmacy in Geriatric Patients
Older people are more susceptible to toxicology due to decreased kidney function,
altered GI absorption, or decreased liver vascular flow . Kidneys undergo many
changes with age . Decreased liver function makes it harder to detoxify blood and
eliminate substances like medications and alcohol . Common over-the-counter
medications used by older people include aspirin, antacids, cough syrups, and
decongestants . These can have negative effects mixed with herbal substances,
alcohol, or prescriptions .
polypharmacy refers to the use of multiple prescription medications by one
patient. Negative effects can include overdosing and negative medication
interactions. Medication non-compliance is also an issue due to financial
changes, inability to open containers, and impaired cognitive, vision, or
hearing ability.
12. Behavioral Emergencies in Older Adults
Depression is not normal aging but a medical disease affecting millions of older
Americans . It is treatable with medication and therapy . Untreated depression is
associated with a higher suicide rate in geriatrics . Risk factors include history of
depression, chronic disease, and loss . Substance abuse, isolation, prescription
medicine use, or chronic medical conditions contribute to depression onset .
Suicide: Most older adult suicide victims have recently been diagnosed with
depression and seen a doctor within a month before the event. Older men
have the highest suicide rate in the US. Older persons attempting suicide
choose more lethal means and have diminished capacity to survive.
Predisposing events include death of a loved one, physical illness,
depression/hopelessness, alcohol abuse/dependence, or loss of meaningful
life roles.
When assessing a patient showing signs of depression, ask if they are
considering suicide. If yes, ask if they have a plan. Include this in your report.
13. The GEMS Triangle for Assessing Older Patients
The GEMS diamond was created to highlight differences in older patients . It is an
acronym for issues to consider when assessing an older patient .
G stands for geriatric: Older patients differ from younger ones. Be familiar
with normal aging changes and treat with compassion and respect.
E stands for Environmental Assessment: Assess the environment for clues
to the patient's condition and the emergency's cause. Preventative care is
vital as older patients may not notice risks.
M stands for Medical Assessment: Older patients have multiple medical
problems and take numerous medications (prescription, OTC, herbal).
Obtaining a thorough medical history is very important.
S stands for Social Assessment: Older people may have smaller social
networks due to loss of loved ones. They may need help with daily living
activities. Consider pamphlets about agencies helping older people.
14. Special Considerations and Assessment of Geriatric Medical
Patients
Assessing geriatric patients has special considerations . These include
communication issues, hearing/visual deficits, and altered consciousness .
Complicated medical histories and medication effects also affect assessment .
Scene safety: geriatric patients are often in homes, retirement homes, or
skilled nursing facilities. Access may be hampered if they cannot reach the
door. Note unsafe environmental conditions. Look for clues explaining history
or current problem. In facilities, find staff to explain the call reason. With
altered mental status, find someone for history and baseline behavior.
Mechanism of Illness and Injury (NOI): NOI can be difficult to determine with
altered mental status or dementia. Ask family, caregivers, or bystanders why
they called. Multiple chronic diseases complicate NOI determination. Chest
pain, shortness of breath, and altered consciousness are always serious.
Primary Assessment: Address life threats and determine transport priority.
Maintain high suspicion for serious injuries, even with minor mechanisms.
General Impression: Assess stable or unstable condition as you
approach. Use AVPU for level of consciousness.
Airway and Breathing (A&B): Aging and disease can compromise airway
protection. Loss of gag reflex and swallowing occurs. Ensure open airway,
free from obstruction (dentures, vomit, fluid, blood). Suction may be
needed. Anatomic changes affect breathing effectiveness. Loss of
protective reflexes decreases ability to clear secretions. Treat airway and
breathing issues with oxygen immediately.
Circulation (C): Poor perfusion is serious. Changes negatively affect
circulation. Lower heart rates and weaker/irregular pulses are common.
Vascular changes may make radial pulse hard to feel. Treat circulatory
problems with oxygen immediately. Determine if a cardiac abnormality is
acute or chronic; manage acute emergencies rapidly.
Transport Decision (D): Complaints compromising airway, breathing, or
circulation require priority transport. Determine and treat life-threatening
conditions; transport priority patients. Older people lack reserves and
decompensate quickly. Consider early ALS treatment and immediate
transport.
15. History Taking and Secondary Assessment of Geriatric
Patients
Find and account for all medications . Communication can be complicated, but
thorough history is critical . Determine early if altered consciousness is acute or
chronic . Multiple diseases and vague complaints complicate assessment .
Take a full set of vital signs and determine the patient's normal. The chief
complaint may relate to a chronic condition. Obtain a list of medications and
take them to the hospital if possible. Transport to a facility familiar with the
patient's history if possible. Last oral intake is important for diabetic patients
and may indicate dehydration.
Secondary assessment: Protect patient modesty and keep them warm
during the exam.
Vital signs: Medications like beta blockers keep heart rate low, preventing
tachycardia seen in dehydration/shock. Weak/irregular pulses are common.
Circulatory compromise makes radial pulse hard to feel; use other pulse
points. Blood pressure tends to be higher. Capillary refill is unreliable due to
skin changes and reduced circulation. Respiratory rate should be normal, but
chest rise is compromised by stiffness. Pulse oximetry requires adequate
perfusion for accuracy.
Reassessment: Reassess geriatric patients often as conditions can
deteriorate quickly. Recheck interventions, identify and treat changes.
Document all history, medication, assessment, and intervention information.
Guidelines for assessing geriatric patients are available.
16. Trauma in the Geriatric Population
Increased Risks and Complications of
Trauma
Factors
Higher risk of serious injury or death Slower homeostatic compensatory
mechanism
Complicated assessment Limited physiologic reserves
Subtler physical findings Normal aging effects
Longer healing process Existing medical conditions
Older patients have a higher risk of serious injury or death from trauma than younger
patients . Several conditions increase this risk and complicate assessment . Physical
findings may be more subtle and easily missed . The healing process takes longer .
Older pedestrians are more likely to have life-threatening complications after being
struck by a vehicle . Secondary impacts can cause serious injuries .
Older people are more likely to experience burns due to altered mental status,
inattention, and compromised neurologic status. Mortality from burns
increases with pre-existing conditions and a weakened immune system. Fluid
replacement is complicated by renal compromise.
There is higher mortality from penetrating trauma, especially gunshot
wounds. Penetrating trauma can easily cause serious internal bleeding.
Falls are the leading cause of fatal and non-fatal injuries in older adults.
Nearly half of fatal falls result in traumatic brain injuries.
Changes in pulmonary, cardiovascular, neurologic, and musculoskeletal
systems make older patients more susceptible to trauma. Brain shrinkage
increases the risk of cerebral bleeding after head trauma. Skeletal changes
and spinal curvature require extra padding during spinal immobilization. Loss
of strength, sensory impairment, and medical illness increase fall risk.
A geriatric patient's overall physical condition may lessen their ability to
compensate for simple injuries.
osteoporosis predisposes to hip and pelvis fractures; compression fractures
of the spine are more likely.
Brain shrinkage makes older patients more likely to sustain closed head
injuries like subdural hematomas. Acute subdural hematomas are among the
deadliest head injuries. Serious head injuries are often missed because
mechanisms seem minor. Factors predisposing to serious head injuries
include long-term alcohol abuse, recurrent falls, repeated head injuries, and
anticoagulation medications.
17. Environmental Injuries and Trauma Assessment in Older Adults
Changes in the endocrine system cause delayed internal temperature regulation .
Heat gain and loss are further delayed by impaired circulation, decreased sweat
production, chronic diseases, medication, and alcohol use . Half of hypothermia
deaths occur in older people . Most indoor hypothermia deaths involve geriatric
patients . Death rates from hyperthermia more than double in older people . People
over 85 are at the highest risk . Trauma in geriatric patients is rarely isolated to a
single issue .
Trauma Assessment: Look for clues indicating if a medical incident preceded
the trauma. Address life threats and determine transport priority. Transporting
older patients to a trauma center is recommended.
General Impression: Get information from someone familiar with the
patient if possible. Use AVPU and GCS for mental status.
Airway: Diminished cough ability makes suctioning important. Assess for
dentures but don't remove unless they obstruct the airway.
Circulation: Alcohol and anticoagulants worsen internal/external bleeding.
Older patients can go into shock more easily. Hypertensive patients may
have normal blood pressure while in shock.
Investigate the chief complaint and consider past medical conditions.
Secondary Assessment: Perform physical exams like on younger adults, but
consider damage likelihood. Head injuries are life-threatening. Examine the
chest, considering impaired breathing. Look for bruising and trauma evidence.
Assess pulse, blood pressure, and vital signs. Capillary refill is unreliable due
to compromised circulation. Beta blockers inhibit tachycardia expected in
shock. Repeat the primary assessment. geriatric patients are more likely to
decompensate after trauma.
Broken bones are common and should be splinted. Do not force kyphosis into
normal position. Provide blankets and heat to prevent hypothermia. Provide
psychological support along with medical treatment. Document assessment,
treatment, and reassessment, including status changes.
18. Responding to Calls in Nursing and Skilled Facilities
Calls at nursing homes or skilled facilities can be challenging . Patients often have
altered consciousness and cannot provide NOI or mechanism of injury . The most
important information is what is wrong and what is different today that prompted the
call . Talk to the staff who care for the patient daily .
Infection control is a high priority.
MRSA infections are common in close quarters like nursing homes. It can
be found in ulcers, feeding tubes, and catheters. Protect yourself and
reduce spread by washing hands before and after every patient contact.
Properly dispose of or disinfect equipment and use standard precautions.
VRE is a cause of hospital-acquired infections.
RSV infects upper and lower respiratory tracts. It is highly contagious and
found in nasal/throat discharges. Wear appropriate PPE and
decontaminate the ambulance/equipment.
C. diff causes hospital-acquired infectious diarrhea. Healthcare workers
can carry it after contact with contaminated feces. Alcohol-based hand
sanitizers do not kill C. diff. Contact precautions with gowns, gloves, and
hand-washing with soap and water are essential to prevent transmission.
SARS-CoV-2 causes COVID-19, a respiratory illness affecting vulnerable
older people, especially with pre-existing conditions. It spreads through
airborne droplets.
19. Caring for Dying Patients and Advanced Directives
More terminally ill older patients are choosing to die at home . Dying patients receive
palliative or comfort care . This focuses on relieving pain and providing emotional
support for the patient and loved ones . Your interaction with a dying patient impacts
the family long-term; be understanding, sensitive, and compassionate .
Advanced directives are legal papers guiding relatives/caregivers about
medical treatment for patients unable to speak for themselves.
A Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) order gives permission not to attempt
resuscitation from cardiac arrest. A valid DNR must be signed by the
patient/surrogate and a physician/healthcare provider.
A DNR does not mean "do not treat". If the patient is alive, provide
supportive measures like oxygen, pain relief, and comfort.
A healthcare power of attorney is an advanced directive where an
authorized person makes medical decisions for the patient.
A POLST (Physician Orders for Sustaining Treatment) provides medical
orders in addition to advanced directives. Orders may be specific to
patients with life-threatening conditions or frail health.
If there is any question about orders or no written orders, initiate
resuscitation.
20. Elder Abuse and Neglect
Elder abuse is any action by a person that takes advantage of an older person's
property or emotional state . Abuse can be acts of commission (words/actions
causing harm, like verbal, physical, sexual assault) . Abuse can also be acts of
omission (failure to act, like denying nutrition or medical care) .
Elder abuse is often hidden. Definitions of abuse/neglect vary. Victims are
hesitant to report due to feeling traumatized or fearing punishment.
Abused persons are often frail with chronic medical conditions or dementia.
Abuse most often occurs in women older than 75.
Abusers may be products of child abuse themselves, with abuse being
retaliatory. Most abusers are not trained in older person care. Environments
like nursing homes are sites where older people sustain harm (physical,
physiological, financial, pharmacological).
Be suspicious of abuse if answers about injuries are concealed or avoided, or
if answers are unbelievable.
Information suggesting abuse includes caregiver apathy or defensiveness,
caregiver not allowing patient to answer, repeated ER visits, history of being
accident prone, unbelievable/vague/inconsistent injury explanations. Other
signs include chronic pain without explanation, self-destructive behavior,
eating/sleep disorders, depression, lack of energy, and substance/sexual
abuse history. Many abused patients make false statements due to fear of
retribution.
Signs of physical abuse include bruises on buttocks/lower back, genitals/inner
thighs, cheeks/ear lobes, neck, upper lip, or inside the mouth. Pressure
bruises from a hand may be oval grab marks, pinch marks, or hand prints.
Human bites are typically on upper extremities and can cause
lacerations/infections. Inspect earlobes for signs of twisting, pulling, or
pinching. Investigate multiple bruises in various stages or signs of being
undernourished.
Typical abuse burns are caused by cigarettes, matches, heated metal, forced
immersion in hot liquids, chemicals, and electrical sources.
Check for signs of neglect like lack of hygiene, poor dental hygiene, poor
temperature regulation, or lack of reasonable home amenities. Regard injuries
to genitals or rectum without reported trauma as potential sexual abuse.
