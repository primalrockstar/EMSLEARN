## Chapter 34: Obstetrics and Neonatal Care

### Overview
Covers childbirth, normal and abnormal deliveries, and neonatal assessment and care.

### Learning Objectives
- Recognize signs of imminent delivery.
- Assist with safe childbirth in the field.
- Assess and care for the newborn.

### Key Terms
| Term     | Definition |
|----------|------------|
| Crowning | Appearance of fetal head at vaginal opening. |
| APGAR    | Scoring system for newborn assessment. |
| Meconium | Fetal stool, risk for aspiration. |

### Major Concepts & Guidelines
- Prepare for delivery and neonatal resuscitation.
- Support mother and monitor for complications.
- Use APGAR for newborn assessment.

### Procedures / Protocols
- **Delivery:**  
  - Support head, clear airway, dry/warm baby.
- **Neonatal Care:**  
  - Assess APGAR at 1 and 5 minutes.

### Assessment & Clinical Pearls
- Meconium-stained fluid: suction airway if needed.
- Clamp/cut cord after pulsations stop.

### Documentation Standards
- Record times, complications, interventions.

### Case Example
> Delivery in ambulance, baby not crying. What are EMS priorities?

### Quick Reference Table
| APGAR Element | 0 | 1 | 2 |
|---------------|---|---|---|
| Appearance    | Blue | Pink body | Pink all over |
| Pulse         | Absent | <100 | >100 |

### Review Questions
1. What does APGAR stand for?
2. What is crowning?
3. How is neonatal airway managed?

## Chapter 35: Pediatric Emergencies

### Overview
Discusses assessment and management of medical and trauma emergencies in children.

### Learning Objectives
- Modify assessment for pediatric patients.
- Recognize and treat respiratory distress and shock.
- Understand pediatric anatomy and physiology.

### Key Terms
| Term      | Definition |
|-----------|------------|
| Pediatric | Birth to adolescence. |
| Epiglottitis | Life-threatening airway infection. |
| Croup      | Upper airway infection, "barking cough." |

### Major Concepts & Guidelines
- Pediatric airway is narrower and easily obstructed.
- Early recognition and intervention prevent deterioration.
- Use Broselow tape for medication/dosing.

### Procedures / Protocols
- **Airway:**  
  - Position, suction, oxygen as needed.
- **Shock:**  
  - Recognize subtle signs, treat aggressively.

### Assessment & Clinical Pearls
- Look for grunting, retractions, nasal flaring.
- Vital signs vary by age.

### Documentation Standards
- Record age, weight, interventions, response.

### Case Example
> Infant with fever, drooling, and stridor. What is likely, and what is EMS management?

### Quick Reference Table
| Age         | Normal Pulse | Notes          |
|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| Infant      | 100â€“160      | Fast, irregular|

### Review Questions
1. Name two signs of pediatric respiratory distress.
2. What is the Broselow tape?
3. Why is shock harder to detect in children?

## Chapter 36: Geriatric Emergencies

### Overview
Explores the challenges and adaptations needed for assessment and management of elderly patients.

### Learning Objectives
- Recognize common geriatric emergencies.
- Modify assessment and communication.
- Identify abuse and neglect.

### Key Terms
| Term      | Definition |
|-----------|------------|
| Polypharmacy | Use of multiple medications. |
| Elder Abuse  | Harm or neglect of elderly. |
| Dementia     | Chronic cognitive impairment. |

### Major Concepts & Guidelines
- Multiple comorbidities complicate care.
- Communication may be impaired.
- Be alert for signs of neglect or abuse.

### Procedures / Protocols
- **Assessment:**  
  - Use clear, slow speech, involve caregivers.
- **Abuse:**  
  - Mandatory reporting.

### Assessment & Clinical Pearls
- Atypical presentations common.
- High risk for medication interactions.

### Documentation Standards
- Record findings, interventions, concerns.

### Case Example
> Elderly patient with confusion and bruises. What should EMS consider?

### Quick Reference Table
| Concern    | EMS Action      | Note         |
|------------|----------------|--------------|
| Polypharmacy | List meds     | Ask about interactions|

### Review Questions
1. What are signs of elder abuse?
2. Why are geriatric patients at higher risk for adverse drug reactions?
3. How is dementia managed in EMS?
