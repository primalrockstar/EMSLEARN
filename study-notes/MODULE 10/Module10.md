# Module 10: Trauma Overview Bleeding & Soft‐Tissue Injuries

---

## Chapter 25: Trauma Overview

### Overview
Introduces the concepts of trauma assessment, mechanisms of injury, and triage in the prehospital setting.

### Learning Objectives
- Recognize types and mechanisms of trauma.
- Perform a rapid trauma assessment.
- Apply triage principles to trauma patients.

### Key Terms
| Term         | Definition |
|--------------|------------|
| MOI          | Mechanism of Injury. |
| Blunt Trauma | Injury from force without penetration. |
| Penetrating Trauma | Injury from objects piercing the body. |
| Triage       | Sorting patients by severity. |

### Major Concepts & Guidelines
- Trauma is a leading cause of death; early recognition and management are critical.
- Assess MOI for clues to hidden injuries.
- Use trauma triage protocols for destination decisions.

### Procedures / Protocols
- **Rapid Trauma Assessment:**  
  - ABCDE, head-to-toe survey, identify life threats.
- **Triage:**  
  - Use START or local protocol.

### Assessment & Clinical Pearls
- High index of suspicion for internal injuries.
- Always reassess after interventions.

### Documentation Standards
- Document MOI, assessment, interventions, and disposition.

### Case Example
> Car accident with significant vehicle damage. What injuries should EMS anticipate?

### Quick Reference Table
| MOI           | Possible Injury | Intervention         |
|---------------|----------------|----------------------|
| High-speed MVC| Head, spine, chest| Immobilize, rapid transport |

### Review Questions
1. What is MOI?
2. Name two types of trauma.
3. Why is triage important?

## Chapter 26: Bleeding

### Overview
Covers recognition and management of hemorrhage, types of bleeding, shock, and prehospital interventions.

### Learning Objectives
- Identify types and sources of bleeding.
- Implement bleeding control techniques.
- Recognize and treat hemorrhagic shock.

### Key Terms
| Term      | Definition |
|-----------|------------|
| Arterial  | Bright red, spurting bleed. |
| Venous    | Dark red, steady bleed. |
| Capillary | Oozing bleed. |
| Tourniquet| Device to stop severe limb bleeding. |

### Major Concepts & Guidelines
- Uncontrolled bleeding is life-threatening.
- Direct pressure is first-line intervention.
- Tourniquets for severe limb bleeding not controlled by pressure.

### Procedures / Protocols
- **Bleeding Control:**  
  - Apply direct pressure, use hemostatic dressings, apply tourniquet as needed.

### Assessment & Clinical Pearls
- Early recognition prevents shock.
- Do not remove dressings once applied.

### Documentation Standards
- Record site, type, amount of bleeding, interventions.

### Case Example
> Severe arm laceration with arterial bleeding. What is the EMS approach?

### Quick Reference Table
| Bleed Type | Color/Flow   | Control Method      |
|------------|--------------|---------------------|
| Arterial   | Bright red, spurting | Tourniquet, pressure |

### Review Questions
1. What is the first step in bleeding control?
2. When is a tourniquet indicated?
3. What are risk factors for hemorrhagic shock?

## Chapter 27: Soft-Tissue Injuries

### Overview
Discusses wounds, burns, and other soft-tissue trauma, including assessment and management.

### Learning Objectives
- Classify types of soft-tissue injuries.
- Provide appropriate wound care in the field.
- Recognize complications (infection, shock).

### Key Terms
| Term        | Definition |
|-------------|------------|
| Abrasion    | Scrape of skin. |
| Laceration  | Cut through skin/tissue. |
| Avulsion    | Tissue torn away. |
| Burn        | Injury from heat, chemicals, electricity. |

### Major Concepts & Guidelines
- Clean and cover wounds; control bleeding.
- Burns: assess depth and surface area; prevent hypothermia.
- Avoid further contamination.

### Procedures / Protocols
- **Wound Care:**  
  - Control bleeding, dress wound, monitor for shock.
- **Burns:**  
  - Cool with water, cover with dry dressing.

### Assessment & Clinical Pearls
- Assess for underlying injuries.
- Monitor for signs of infection.

### Documentation Standards
- Record type, size, location, care provided.

### Case Example
> Chemical burn to hand. What is the field management?

### Quick Reference Table
| Injury    | Priority        | Field Care      |
|-----------|----------------|-----------------|
| Deep burn | High            | Cool, cover, transport |

### Review Questions
1. What are the main types of burns?
2. How is an avulsion managed?
3. Why is infection risk higher with soft-tissue injuries?
