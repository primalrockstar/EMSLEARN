1. Introduction to Bleeding and the Circulatory System
Component Function
Heart Pumps blood [7]
Blood Vessels Serve as the container for blood [7]
Blood and Body Fluids The fluid circulated [7]
Bleeding can be external and visible or internal and hidden [4].
Both types of bleeding are potentially dangerous and can lead to weakness, shock,
and death [4].
Uncontrolled bleeding is a common cause of hypoperfusion following traumatic
injury [5].
The circulatory system circulates blood to all body cells and tissues [5].
It delivers oxygen and nutrients and carries away metabolic waste products [6].
The system is responsible for supplying and maintaining adequate blood flow [6].
The contents of the circulatory system are the heart (pump), blood vessels
(container), and blood and body fluids (fluid) [7].
The heart requires a rich and well-distributed blood supply [9].
It works as two paired pumps: the upper chamber (atrium) and the lower chamber
(ventricles) [10].
Blood leaves each chamber through a one-way valve [11].
Types of blood vessels include arteries, arterioles, capillaries, venules, and veins [13]
.
Oxygen and nutrients pass from capillaries into cells, while waste and carbon dioxide
diffuse from cells back into capillaries [14].
Blood contains red blood cells (oxygen/carbon dioxide transport), white blood cells
(fighting infection), platelets (forming blood clots), and plasma (liquid part) [15].
Blood clot formation depends on blood stasis, changes in blood vessel walls (like a
wound), or the blood's ability to clot [18].
The autonomic nervous system monitors the body's needs and adjusts blood flow by
constricting or dilating blood vessels [20].
It automatically redirects blood away from other organs to the heart, brain, lungs, and
kidneys in an emergency [22].
This system adapts to changing conditions and maintains homeostasis and perfusion
[22].
2. Pathophysiology and Perfusion
perfusion is the circulation of blood within an organ or tissue [24].
It must be in adequate amounts to meet cell needs for oxygen, nutrients, and waste
removal [24].
Blood flow speed must be fast enough to maintain adequate circulation and avoid
clotting [24].
It must also be slow enough to allow cells time to exchange oxygen and nutrients for
waste products [24].
Some tissues need a constant blood supply [25].
Others can survive with very little blood [25].
All tissues, organs, and organ systems rely on adequate perfusion to function
properly [26].
Some organs cannot tolerate a blood supply interruption for more than a few minutes
without damage [27].
Death of an organ system can quickly lead to the death of a patient [28].
The heart requires a constant flow of blood [29].
If the circulatory system fails to provide significant circulation, shock results [23].

hemorrhage means bleeding, and external bleeding is a visible hemorrhage [29].
With serious external bleeding, estimating the amount of blood loss can be difficult [30]
.
Blood looks different on different surfaces, making estimation important [31].
The body cannot tolerate an acute blood loss greater than 20 percent of blood
volume (about two pints) [32].
Adverse changes in vital signs occur with significant blood loss [33].
These include an increase in heart rate, an increase in respiratory rate, and a
decrease in blood pressure [33].
How well people compensate for blood loss depends on how rapidly they bleed [34].
Rapid blood loss, even if less than 20%, can cause signs of hypovolemic shock [35].
The patient's age and pre-existing health should also be considered [36].
Bleeding is considered serious if certain conditions are present [37].
These conditions include poor general appearance, no response to external stimuli,
signs of shock, significant blood loss, rapid blood loss, uncontrolled bleeding, or a
significant mechanism of injury [37].
Types of external bleeding are arterial, venous, and capillary [38].
Arterial bleeding spurts with the pulse and is typically brighter red [39].
Venous bleeding is dark red and does not spurt [40].
Capillary bleeding is dark red and oozes slowly [41].
Venous and capillary bleeding are more likely to clot spontaneously than arterial
bleeding [40].
4. The Clotting Process and Hemophilia
Bleeding tends to stop within about 10 minutes in response to internal mechanisms
and exposure to air [42].
When skin is broken, blood flows rapidly from the open vessel [42].
The cut ends of the vessel begin to narrow, a process called vasoconstriction [43].
vasoconstriction reduces the amount of bleeding [44].
Then a clot forms [44].
Bleeding will not stop if a clot does not form, unless the injured vessel is cut off by
direct pressure or a tourniquet [45].
With hemophilia, the patient lacks one or more blood clotting factors [46].
Bleeding may occur spontaneously in hemophiliacs [46].
All injuries, even trivial ones, are potentially serious for patients with hemophilia [46].
hemophiliac patients should be transported immediately [46].
5. Internal Bleeding: Recognition and Assessment
Possible Causes Signs and Symptoms
Stomach ulcer [51] Pain (most common) [57]
Lacerated liver [51] Swelling in the area [57]
Ruptured spleen [51] Distension (chest cavity, lung) [57]
Broken bones [51] Hematoma or bruising [57]
Contusions or
ecchymosis [52]
Bleeding from any body opening (mouth, rectum, hematuria,
vaginal, hematemesis, melena) [57]
Ulcers [55] Pain, tenderness, bruising, guarding, or swelling (possible
fractures) [58]
Bleeding in the colon [55] Rigid, distended abdomen [58]
Ruptured ectopic
pregnancy [55]
Change in mental status (anxiety, restlessness,
combativeness) [59]
Aneurysms [55] Weakness, faintness, or dizziness on standing [59]
Closed unstable pelvic
fracture [111]
Change in skin [60]
Tachycardia [60]
Thirst [60]
Nausea and vomiting [60]
Cool, moist, clammy skin [60]
Shallow, rapid breathing [60]
Dull eyes, slightly dilated pupils slow to respond to light [60]
Cap refill over two seconds (infants, children) [61]
Weak rapid pulse [61]
Decreasing blood pressure [61]
Altered mental status [61]
Internal bleeding can be very serious because it is not easy to detect immediately [48]
.
Injury or damage to internal organs commonly causes extensive internal bleeding [49].
Internal bleeding can lead to hypovolemic shock [50].
Possible causes include stomach ulcers, lacerated liver, ruptured spleen, and broken
bones [51].
Signs of internal bleeding may include contusions or ecchymosis [52].
A high-speed mechanism of injury increases suspicion for serious unseen injury [52].
Blunt trauma and penetrating trauma are mechanisms for internal bleeding [53].
The mnemonic DCAP-BTLS is used to assess for signs of injuries [53].
This stands for deformities, contusions, abrasions, punctures, penetrations, burns,
lateral tenderness, laceration, swelling, and other signs of injury [53].
Internal bleeding is not always caused by trauma [54].
Non-traumatic causes can be ulcers, bleeding in the colon, ruptured ectopic
pregnancy, or aneurysms [55].
Recognizing a patient in shock and responding appropriately is important [56].
Signs and symptoms of internal bleeding include pain, swelling, distension, and
bruising (hematoma) [57].
Bleeding from any body opening can indicate internal bleeding [57].
This includes bright red bleeding from the mouth or rectum, hematuria, non-menstrual
vaginal bleeding, hematemesis (vomiting blood), and melena (black, tarry stool) [57].
Pain, tenderness, bruising, guarding, or swelling can indicate possible closed fractures
or broken ribs [58].
A rigid, distended abdomen might be seen [58].
hypoperfusion (hypovolemic shock) can cause changes in mental status like anxiety,
restlessness, or combativeness [59].
Weakness, faintness, or dizziness on standing are signs [59].
Changes in skin can also occur [60].
Later signs of hypoperfusion include tachycardia, weakness, fainting, thirst, nausea,
vomiting, and cool, clammy skin [60].
Shallow, rapid breathing, dull eyes, slightly dilated pupils, and a weak rapid pulse may
be present [60].
Capillary refill over two seconds in infants and children is a sign [61].
Decreasing blood pressure and altered mental status are also indicators [61].
Patients with these signs and symptoms require prompt transport [61].
6. Patient Assessment in Bleeding Emergencies
The scene size-up involves being alert for potential hazards, especially in violent
incidents [62].
Ensure police are on scene if necessary and follow standard precautions [62].
Consider the mechanism of injury and the need for spinal immobilization and
additional resources [62].
The primary assessment focuses on identifying life threats without distraction [63].
Form a general impression to identify serious conditions [64].
Perform a rapid exam [65].
Address obvious life-threatening external bleeding first [65].
Assess skin color [65].
Determine the level of consciousness using the AVPU scale [66].
Assess the ABCs (Airway, Breathing, Circulation) and the D (Transport Decision)
[67].
Ensure a patent airway and provide high-flow oxygen [67].
Assist ventilations if needed using a bag-valve mask or non-rebreather mask [68].
Insert an oral pharyngeal airway if the patient is unconscious [68].
Assess pulse rate and quality, skin condition, color, temperature, and cap refill time for
circulation [69].
Control external bleeding and treat for shock [69].
Make the transport decision based on ABCs and life threats [70].
Patients with significant bleeding can become unstable quickly [72].
Signs needing rapid transport include tachycardia, tachypnea, low blood pressure,
weak pulse, or clammy skin [73].
History taking involves investigating the chief complaint [74].
Look for signs and symptoms of other injuries based on the mechanism of injury or
nature of illness [75].
Gather the SAMPLE history (Signs, Allergies, Medications, Past medical history, Last
oral intake, Events leading up to injury) [76].
Ask about blood-thinning medications [76].
For unresponsive patients, get history from medical alert tags or bystanders [77].
Look for signs of shock and estimate the amount of blood loss [77].
The secondary assessment involves assessing all areas using DCAP-BTLS [78].
Check the head for uncontrolled bleeding from scalp lacerations [79].
Feel all four abdominal quadrants for tenderness or rigidity [80].
Record pulse, motor, and sensory functions in the extremities [81].
Record vital signs [81].
With critically injured patients or short transport times, a full secondary assessment
may not be possible [82].
Reassessment is done frequently, especially in areas with abnormal findings [83].
Reassess unstable patients every 5 minutes and stable patients every 15 minutes [83].
Interventions include high-flow oxygen, controlling external bleeding, treating for
shock, and rapid transport [84].
If internal bleeding is suspected, provide high-flow oxygen and rapid transport [85].
Do not delay transport to complete assessments [86].
7. Emergency Care for External Bleeding
Method Application Notes
Direct Pressure Apply glove fingertip
or hand over sterile
dressing [94]
Most common and effective method [92].
Apply pressure for at least 5 minutes [95].
Pressure Dressing Wrap sterile, selfadhering
roller
bandage around
wound [96]
Stretch tight enough to control bleeding [96].
Should still feel distal pulse [97]. Do not
remove until physician evaluates [98]. Add
more dressings if bleeds through [99].
Tourniquets Apply above the
level of bleeding
[100]
Useful for substantial extremity bleeding not
controlled by direct pressure [99]. If not
possible, consider additional tourniquet or
wound packing [100]. Follow skill drill 26-3 [108].
Hemostatic
Dressing/Wound
Packing
Pack gauze or
dressing into larger
wounds [103]
Used when direct pressure is inadequate or
tourniquet is not possible [103]. Hemostatic
dressing has chemical to promote clot
formation [104]. Can be used with wound
packing and direct pressure [105]. Follow skill
drill 26-2 [106].
Junctional
Tourniquets
Apply for proximal
compression in
areas like groin or
axilla [108]
For severe hemorrhage at the junction of
torso with arms/legs [109]. Pelvic binder is a
type [109].
Air Splints Apply to entire
extremity [109]
Controls internal and external bleeding with
severe extremity injuries [109]. Immobilizes
fractures [109]. Acts like a pressure dressing
[109].
Pelvic Binder Apply for suspected
closed unstable
pelvic fracture [110]
Helps control internal bleeding, especially
with life-threatening open-book pelvic
fracture [111].
Follow standard precautions when providing emergency care for external bleeding
[88].
Wear a mask, gloves, eye protection, and sometimes a gown [88].
Ensure the patient has an open airway and is breathing adequately [89].
Provide high-flow oxygen [90].
If obvious life-threatening bleeding is present, control it quickly [90].
Several methods exist to control external bleeding [91].
These include direct pressure, pressure dressings, tourniquets, hemostatic
dressing, and wound packing [91].
Direct pressure is the most common and effective method [92].
Pressure stops blood flow and allows normal coagulation [93].
Apply pressure with a gloved fingertip or hand over a sterile dressing [94].
For a protruding object, stabilize it with bulky dressing and apply pressure [95].
Hold uninterrupted pressure for at least five minutes [95].
A pressure dressing involves wrapping a sterile, self-adhering bandage firmly around
the wound [96].
Stretch the bandage tightly enough to control bleeding [96].
You should still feel a distal pulse after applying the dressing [97].
Do not remove the dressing until a physician has evaluated the patient [98].
Add more dressings if the first one bleeds through [99].
A tourniquet is useful for substantial extremity bleeding not controlled by direct
pressure [99].
Apply the tourniquet above the level of bleeding [100].
If a single tourniquet is not possible, consider an additional one or wound packing [100].
Follow the skill drill for applying a commercial tourniquet [108].
Wound packing uses gauze packed into larger wounds [103].
This is done when direct pressure is inadequate or a tourniquet is not possible [103].
A hemostatic dressing is impregnated with a chemical that promotes clot formation
[104].
It can be used with wound packing and direct pressure [105].
Follow the skill drill for wound packing [106].
junctional tourniquets provide proximal compression for bleeding in areas like the
groin or axilla [108].
They are indicated for severe hemorrhage at the junction of the torso with limbs [109].
A pelvic binder is a type of junctional tourniquet [109].
air splints can control internal and external bleeding associated with severe extremity
injuries [109].
They also immobilize fractures and act as a pressure dressing for an entire extremity
[109].
A pelvic binder is indicated for suspected closed unstable pelvic fractures [110].
It helps control internal bleeding from open-book pelvic fractures [111].
8. Emergency Care for Internal Bleeding and Special Cases
Controlling internal bleeding or bleeding from a major organ usually requires surgery
or other hospital procedures [120].
Try to keep the patient calm, reassured, and quiet [120].
Provide high-flow oxygen [121].
Maintain the patient's body temperature [121].
Splint the injured extremity, usually with an air splint [121].
Never use a tourniquet to control bleeding from a closed internal or soft tissue injury
[121].
Follow the skill drill for caring for patients with internal bleeding [121].
Bleeding from the nose, ears, or mouth can result from several conditions [112].
These include skull fracture, facial injury, sinusitis, infection, nose drop abuse, dried
nasal mucosa, high blood pressure, coagulation disorders, digital trauma, or cancer
[112].
Epistaxis (nosebleed) is a common emergency [114].
It can occasionally cause enough blood loss to lead to shock [114].
Much of the blood may pass down the throat into the stomach [115].
Swallowing a large amount of blood can cause nausea and vomiting [115].
Most non-traumatic nosebleeds occur from sites in the septum [115].
Pinching the nostrils together is usually effective for this type of bleeding [115].
Bleeding from the nose or ears after a head injury may indicate a skull fracture [116].
This type of bleeding may be difficult to control [116].
Do not attempt to stop this blood flow by applying excessive pressure [116].
Excessive pressure may force blood to collect in the head [116].
Loosely cover the bleeding site with a sterile gauze pad to collect blood [117].
This also keeps contaminants away [117].
Apply light compression by wrapping a bulky dressing around the head [118].
A target or halo shaped stain on the dressing may indicate the presence of
cerebrospinal fluid [119].
9. Communication and Documentation
Do not delay transport of any patient to complete assessments [86].
It is essential to communicate and document in bleeding emergencies [86].
Recognize, estimate, and report the amount of blood loss [86].
Report how rapidly the bleeding occurred [87].
Communicate all relevant information to the staff at the receiving hospital [87].
This includes all injuries, the care provided, and the patient's response [87].
10. Conclusion and Review
What is not a component of the cardiovascular system? The lungs are part of the
respiratory system [123].
How is perfusion most accurately defined? It is the circulation of enough oxygen and
nutrients in significant amounts [124].
Which injury is the highest treatment priority for a man in a motorcycle crash with
multiple abrasions and lacerations? A one-inch laceration on the thigh squirting blood
(arterial bleeding) is the highest priority [126].
Which set of vital signs is least indicative of internal bleeding? Vital signs that do not
show significant changes are least indicative [128].
When caring for a patient with internal bleeding, what must the EMT do first? The EMT
must first take appropriate standard precautions [129].
What is the quickest and most effective way to control external bleeding from an
extremity? Direct pressure is the quickest and most effective way [130].

history of cardiac issues and high blood pressure? High blood pressure is the most
likely contributing factor [132].
When caring for epistaxis, what is the most effective way to prevent aspiration of
blood? Leaning the patient forward and tilting them forward is most effective [135].
What does controlling internal bleeding typically require? Controlling internal bleeding
usually requires surgical intervention [136].
