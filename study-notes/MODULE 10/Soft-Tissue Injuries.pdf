1. Introduction to Soft-Tissue Injuries
Soft tissue injuries are common [4]. They can be as serious as life-threatening internal injuries
[4]. You should not become distracted by dramatic open wounds [5]. Soft tissues can be
injured by blunt force, penetrating injury, barotrauma, or burns [5]. Wound care is frequently
performed in emergency departments [8]. Most injuries require basic interventions [9]. Death is
often related to hemorrhage or infection [10]. Infection can be life or limb threatening [11]. This
is especially true in children, older adults, and people with weakened immune systems [11].
Simple protective actions can often prevent injuries and complications [12].

The skin is the body's first line of defense [14]. It protects against external forces and infection
[14]. It is the largest organ in the body [15]. Skin varies in thickness with age and location [18].
Injuries can expose blood vessels, nerves, and bones [16]. The EMT must control bleeding and
prevent contamination [17]. Protecting wounds and applying dressings is important [17]. The
skin is a barrier against infection [27]. It is also a sensory organ [27]. It assists with body
temperature regulation [27]. Skin helps maintain fluid balance [27]. A break in the skin allows
bacteria to enter [28]. This increases the possibility of infection, fluid loss, and loss of
temperature control [28].
3. Pathophysiology of Wound Healing
Healing of wounds is a natural process [31]. It involves several overlapping stages [31]. All
stages aim to maintain homeostasis [31]. Cessation of bleeding is the primary concern [32]. The
next stage is inflammation [32]. Additional cells move to the damaged area to begin repair [32].
White blood cells migrate to combat pathogens [33]. Lymphocytes destroy bacteria and
pathogens [34]. Mast cells release histamine [34]. Inflammation removes foreign material and
damaged cells [35]. A new layer of cells moves into the region [36]. New blood vessels form to
bring oxygen and nutrients [37]. Collagen provides stability to damaged tissue [38]. It joins
wound borders, closing the open tissue [38].

contusions result from blunt force trauma [39]. The epidermis remains intact [40]. Cells within
the dermis are damaged [40]. Small blood vessels are usually torn [41]. Blood buildup produces
ecchymosis [42]. A hematoma is blood collection within damaged tissues [43]. It occurs when a
large blood vessel is damaged [44]. Crush injuries depend on force and duration [46].
Continued compression cuts off circulation [47]. crush syndrome can develop after prolonged
entrapment [48]. Damaged muscle cells release harmful substances [49]. compartment
syndrome develops from increased pressure within a compartment [51]. This interferes with
circulation and oxygen delivery [52]. Severe closed injuries can damage internal organs [56].
Reassess skin color, temperature, and pulses distal to the injury [55].

Four types of open wounds are abrasions, lacerations, avulsions, and penetrating wounds [58].
An abrasion is a superficial wound from friction [60]. A laceration is a jagged cut from a sharp
object or blunt force [61]. An avulsion separates tissue layers [61]. Tissues may be detached or
hang as a flap [61]. avulsions often have significant bleeding [62]. Replace the flap if possible;
never remove it [63]. An amputation is complete severance of a body part [64]. penetrating
wounds usually have small entrance wounds [65]. They produce little external bleeding [65].
Impaled objects may damage deep structures [65]. Foreign materials inside tissue can cause
infection [66]. Stabbings and shootings often cause multiple penetrating injuries [67]. Assess
patients carefully to find all wounds [68]. Count penetrating injuries, especially gunshot
wounds [68]. Blast injuries often result in multiple penetrating injuries [70]. blast injury
mechanisms include the blast wave, flying debris, and the victim being thrown [71].
6. Patient Assessment for Soft-Tissue Injuries
Assessing a closed injury is more difficult than an open injury [75]. Begin with scene size-up
[75]. Look for indicators of the mechanism of injury [76]. This helps suspect underlying injuries
[76]. The mechanism of injury provides safety threat information [77]. Use all information to
evaluate scene safety [78]. Consider if additional resources are needed [78]. Perform a primary
assessment [79]. Focus on identifying life threats and transport priority [79]. Form your general
impression [80]. Look for indicators of the patient's condition seriousness [81]. Assess
responsiveness using AVPU [81]. Administer high flow oxygen to patients less than alert [81].
Treat for potential shock and provide immediate transport [81]. Significant bleeding is an
immediate life threat [82]. It must be controlled before opening the airway [82]. If lifethreatening
external bleeding is obvious, control it first [82]. This helps treat for shock [83].
Ensure the airway is clear and patent [85]. Auscultate for clear breath sounds [85]. Assess for
equal chest rise [85]. Provide high flow oxygen or assist ventilations if needed [85]. Evaluate
open chest wounds for air movement [86]. Consider appropriate transport destination [88].
Patients needing immediate transport include those with a poor general impression or altered
level of consciousness [89]. Dyspnea, abnormal vital signs, shock, and severe pain also
indicate immediate transport [89].
Next, take history [90]. Investigate the chief complaint [90]. Use SAMPLE and OPQRST for
trauma patients [90]. Look for DCAP-BTLS during assessments [90]. If the patient is
unresponsive, get history from another source [91]. Chronic medical conditions can complicate
open injuries [92]. Assess interventions and repeat vital signs en route [93]. Assess all
autonomic regions [94]. Look for jugular vein distension and tracheal deviation in the neck [95].
Check the pelvis for stability [96]. Check the abdomen for tenderness, rigidity, and bruising [97]
. Check extremities and record pulse, motor, and sensory function [98]. Signs of poor perfusion
indicate rapid transport [99]. These include tachycardia, tachypnea, low blood pressure, and
cool, pale skin [100]. Conduct reassessment regularly during transport [101]. Repeat the primary
assessment [101]. Pay attention to areas of concern [101]. Assess the effectiveness of prior
treatments [101]. Reassess vital signs and chief complaint [101]. Identify and treat changes in
condition [102]. Communicate and document findings for the hospital [102]. Include mechanism
of injury and patient position [102]. Report estimated blood loss [102]. Include location and
description of wounds treated [102]. Describe the size and depth of the injury [102]. Provide an
accurate account of treatment [102].
7. Emergency Care for Closed Soft-Tissue Injuries
Small contusions generally require no special emergency care [103]. Note their presence to
determine injury extent [104]. More extensive closed injuries can have significant swelling and
bleeding [105]. This could lead to hypovolemic shock [105]. Injuries might not show swelling or
bruising initially [106]. Watch any injury closely while caring for the patient [107]. Treat closed
soft tissue injuries using the rice mnemonic [108]. rice stands for Rest, Ice, Compression,
Elevation, and Splinting [108]. Be alert for signs of developing shock [108]. Signs include anxiety,
changes in mental status, increased heart rate and respiratory rate [108]. Diaphoresis, cool
skin, and decreased blood pressure are also signs [108]. If the patient shows signs of shock,
treat accordingly and aggressively [109].
8. Emergency Care for Open Soft-Tissue Injuries
Injury Type Emergency Care Procedures Source
General Open
Wounds
Follow standard precautions, control bleeding with direct
pressure, pressure dressings, splints, or tourniquets; apply
sterile dressing, do not remove material, flush small wounds
with sterile water if no significant bleeding [110]
[110]
Abdominal
Wounds
Cover with sterile moistened gauze, secure with occlusive
dressing, keep organs moist and warm, immediate transport
to trauma center [120]
[120]
Impaled
Objects
Treat following skill drill 27-1, remove only if obstructing
airway in cheek/mouth or interfering with CPR in chest,
secure and shorten long objects, provide rapid transport [124]
[124]
Open Neck
Injuries
Cover with occlusive dressing, apply manual pressure, do not
compress both carotid arteries simultaneously, use caution
depending on mechanism [130]
[130]
Animal Bites
(Small)
Consider contaminated and potentially infected, evaluated
by physician, major concern for rabies, ensure animal is
secured before entering scene [134]
[134]
Human Bites Contains wide range of bacteria/viruses, considered very
serious if skin penetrated, lacerations by human tooth can
cause serious infection spread [138]
[138]
Bites
(General
Care)
Apply dry sterile dressing, immobilize area with
splint/bandage, transport for surgical cleansing and
antibiotics [142]
[142]
Before caring for an open wound, follow standard precautions [110]. If life-threatening bleeding
is seen, apply direct pressure [110]. Control bleeding using direct pressure and elevation [111].
Pressure dressings or splints, and possibly tourniquets can be used [111]. All open wounds are
assumed contaminated and a risk of infection [112]. Applying a sterile dressing reduces
contamination risk [113]. Do not remove material from the open wound [114]. Small wounds
without significant bleeding can be flushed with sterile water [114]. Chemical burns should be
flushed to remove chemicals [115]. Hospital personnel usually clean open wounds [116].
Splinting can help control bleeding even without a fracture [117].
For abdominal wounds, organs may expose from the wound [118]. This is an evisceration [119].
Cover the wound with sterile, moistened gauze [120]. Secure the gauze with an occlusive
dressing [121]. Keep the organs moist and warm [122]. Most abdominal wounds require
immediate transport to a trauma center [123]. Treat impaled objects following skill drill 27-1 [124]
. Remove impaled objects only if obstructing the airway in the cheek/mouth or interfering with
CPR in the chest [125]. Secure and shorten very long objects [126]. Provide rapid transport [126].
Open neck injuries can be life-threatening [127]. Open neck veins may suck air in [128]. Air
entering a blood vessel can block blood flow in the lungs [129]. This can cause cardiac arrest
from an air embolism [129]. Cover the wound with an occlusive dressing [130]. Manually apply
pressure [130]. Do not compress both carotid arteries simultaneously [130]. This could impair
brain circulation and cause a stroke [130]. Use caution with neck injury patients depending on
the mechanism [131].
Small animal bites are heavily contaminated with bacteria [134]. Consider all small animal bites
contaminated [134]. All small animal bites should be evaluated by a physician [134]. Rabies is a
major concern [135]. Rabies is a fatal viral infection of the central nervous system [135]. It
affects all warm-blooded animals [135]. Children may be seriously injured or killed by dogs [136].
The animal may attack you [137]. Do not enter the scene until the animal is secured [137].
Human mouths contain a wide range of bacteria and viruses [138]. Consider animal bites that
penetrate the skin very serious [139]. lacerations by a human tooth can cause serious infection
spread [140]. For bites, apply a dry sterile dressing [142]. Immobilize the area with a splint or
bandage [142]. Transport to the emergency department for wound cleansing and antibiotics
[142].
9. Burns: Types and Pathophysiology
Burns are among the most serious and painful injuries [143]. A burn occurs when the body
receives too much radiant heat [143]. This results in injury [143]. Sources include heat, toxic
chemicals, or electricity [144]. Always perform a complete assessment [145]. Determine if other
serious injuries are present [145]. Children, older patients, and those with chronic illness are
more likely to experience shock from burns [146]. Burns are soft tissue injuries over a large area
[147]. They are created by transfer of energy [147]. Energy can be radiation, thermal, or
electrical [147]. Thermal burns occur when skin is exposed to temperatures over 111°F [148].
Burn severity correlates with temperature, concentration of heat energy, and duration of
exposure [149]. Burn injuries are progressive [150]. Greater heat energy means a deeper wound
[150]. Exposure time is important [151]. Thermal injury can occur in unresponsive or paralyzed
patients [151]. The skin barrier is destroyed when a person is burned [153]. Burns create a high
risk for infection [153]. Hypothermia, hypovolemia, and shock are also risks [153]. Burns to the
airway are significant [154]. Loose mucosa in the hypopharynx swells [154]. This leads to
complete airway obstruction [154]. Circumferential chest burns can compromise breathing [155].
Circumferential extremity burns can lead to compartment syndrome [156]. This results in
neurovascular compromise and irreversible damage [156]. Call for advanced life support if you
suspect complications [156].
10. Burn Severity and Assessment
Factor Determining
Severity
Description Source
Depth How deep the burn is (superficial, partial thickness,
full thickness)
[157]
Extent Percentage of total body surface area burned (rule
of palm, rule of nines)
[157]
Critical Areas Involved Face, upper airway, hands, feet, genitalia, over
joints [157]
[157]
Patient Factors Pre-existing medical conditions/injuries, age (under
5, older than 55) [157]
[157]
Five factors determine burn severity [157]. These are depth and extent of the burn [157]. Critical
areas involved are also important [157]. These include the face, upper airway, hands, feet, or
genitalia [157]. Pre-existing medical conditions or injuries matter [157]. Patient age is a factor
(under five or older than 55) [157]. Burns to the face are important due to potential airway
involvement [158]. Hand, foot, or joint burns are serious due to potential function loss from
scarring [158].
There are three types of burn depth: first, second, and third degree [158]. First degree is
superficial [160]. It involves only the epidermis [161]. The burn site is often painful [162]. A
sunburn is a first degree burn example [163]. Partial thickness is a second degree burn [164]. It
involves the epidermis and some dermis [165]. These burns do not destroy the skin's entire
thickness [166]. Subcutaneous tissue is not injured [166]. Skin is typically moist and mottled [167].
White or red blisters are present [167]. Second degree burns can cause intense pain [167]. Full
thickness or third degree burns extend through all skin layers [168]. They may involve
subcutaneous layers, muscle, bone, or internal organs [168]. The burned area is dry and
leathery [169]. It may appear white, dark brown, or charred [169]. If nerve endings are
destroyed, the burned area may have no feeling [170]. Surrounding, less severe areas may be
very painful [171]. Significant airway burns are serious [171]. Signs may include singed hair, soot,
hoarseness, or hypoxia [171]. These patients need rapid transport for advanced airway
management [171].
The extent of burns is important [172]. We calculate extent using the rule of palm or rule of
nines [173]. The rule of palm estimates surface area using the patient's palm size [174]. A
patient's palm is roughly one percent of their total body surface [174]. The rule of nines divides
body parts into sections [175]. Each section represents approximately nine percent of the total
body surface area [175]. Proportions differ in infants, children, and adults [176]. When
calculating extent, include only partial and full thickness burns [176]. Document superficial
burns but do not include them in the estimation [176].
11. Assessment and Emergency Care for Burns
When assessing a burn, classify it [179]. Classify based on source, depth, and severity [179].
Ensure the scene is safe [180]. Make sure factors causing the burn are not a hazard [180].
Determine the type of burn sustained [181]. The patient's report provides important information
[181]. Assess the scene for environmental hazards [182]. Determine the number of patients [182].
Call for additional resources [182]. Consider potential for spinal immobilization or injuries [182].
Begin the primary assessment with a rapid assessment [183]. Form a general impression [183].
Look for clues to determine severity [183]. Be suspicious of clues indicating abuse [183].
Consider the need for manual stabilization [183]. Check responsiveness using AVPU [184].
Administer high flow O2 to patients less than alert [184]. Provide immediate transport [184]. For
airway and breathing, look for singed facial hair or soot [185]. Heavy secretions or coughing
may indicate respiratory burn [186]. For circulation, control major bleeding [187]. If obvious lifethreatening
external bleeding exists, control it first [187]. Treat the patient for shock [187]. Treat
shock in burn patients by preventing heat loss [188]. Cover them with a blanket [188]. Consider
rapid transport for airway issues or significant burns [189]. Signs of external bleeding also
require rapid transport [189]. Consider rendezvousing with advanced life support [189].
Next, take history [190]. Investigate the chief complaint [190]. Be alert for signs of other injuries
[191]. If burned in a confined space, suspect inhalation injuries [191]. Obtain medical history [191].
Be alert for injury-specific signs and symptoms [191]. Obtain a SAMPLE history [191]. Ask about
difficulty breathing or swallowing [191]. Check for an emergency medical identification device
[191]. The secondary assessment is a physical exam [192]. Assess the patient head to toe using
DCAP-BTLS [193]. Estimate burn extent using the rule of nines [194]. Determine burn
classification and severity [194]. Package the patient for transport based on findings [195].
Obtain vital signs [195]. Use monitoring devices like oxygen saturation and carbon monoxide
monitors [195]. Reassess the patient and interventions en route [196]. Communicate and
document findings for the hospital [196]. Describe how the burn occurred [196]. Describe the
extent, body surface area, depth, and location [196]. Specifically mention and document if
special areas are involved [197].
Your first responsibility is to stop the burning process [199]. Prevent additional injury [199].
When caring for a burn patient, follow skill drill 27-2 steps [200]. Stop the burning source [206].
Cool the burned area [206]. Remove all jewelry [206]. Maintain a high suspicion for inhalation
injuries [207]. Increased exposure time increases damage [207]. Larger burns make the patient
susceptible to hypothermia or hypovolemia [207]. Apply a dry sterile dressing to patients with
large surface burns [208].

Thermal burns are caused by heat [201]. Common causes are scolds or open flames [201].
Flame burns are often deep [202]. Scalds are commonly seen in children and handicapped
adults [202]. Contact with hot objects causes contact burns [203]. Contact burns are rarely
deep unless the patient is trapped [203]. Steam burns can produce topical or scald burns [204].
Flash burns are produced by an explosion [205]. Lightning strikes can cause a flash burn [205].
Inhalation burns occur when burning is in enclosed spaces [209]. Upper airway damage is from
superheated gases [210]. Lower airway damage is from chemicals or particulate matter [210].
Severe upper airway swelling may occur [211]. This requires immediate intervention [211].
Consider requesting advanced life support [212]. Signs of edema include stridor or singed
nasal hairs [212]. Burns to the face may also be present [212]. Cool mist aerosol or humidified
oxygen can reduce minor edema [213]. Consider carbon monoxide intoxication [215]. Hydrogen
cyanide is also a concern [217]. Signs involve the central nervous system, respiratory, and
cardiovascular systems [218]. Pre-hospital treatment includes decon and supportive care [219].
Chemical burns occur when a toxic substance contacts the body [220]. Most are caused by
strong acids or alkalis [221]. The eyes are particularly vulnerable [222]. Severity relates to the
chemical type, concentration, and duration [223]. Ensure you can safely approach the patient
[223]. You may need to wait for the Hazmat team to decon [224]. Wear appropriate chemicalresistant
gloves and eye protection [224]. Remove the chemical from the patient first [225]. If
dry, brush it off before flushing [225]. Remove all clothing and jewelry [225]. Take care not to
contact the chemical [226]. The patient should be properly deconned [227]. For liquid chemicals,
immediately flush the area with large amounts of water [227]. Continue flushing for 15 to 20
minutes after burning stops [228]. If eyes are burned, hold the eye open and flood with a gentle
water stream [229]. Properly dispose of decon fluid [229].
Electrical burns result from contact with electricity [229]. High voltage burns can occur from
power lines [229]. Ordinary household current can cause severe burns and dysrhythmias [229].
Electricity needs a complete circuit to flow [230]. An insulator prevents a circuit from
completing [231]. A conductor allows current to flow [231]. The human body is a good conductor
[232]. Electrical burns happen when the body completes a circuit [232]. Type of current,
magnitude, and voltage affect seriousness [232]. Your safety is important at electrical scenes
[233]. A burn appears where electricity enters and exits [234]. Dangers include deep tissue
injury and cardiac/respiratory arrest [235]. Management includes starting CPR if indicated [238].
Use an AED and be prepared to defibrillate [238]. Give supplemental oxygen and monitor
closely [238]. Apply dry sterile dressings to burn wounds [239]. Splint suspected fractures [239].
Provide prompt transport [239].
Taser injuries involve darts puncturing the skin [240]. Barbs are generally treated as impaled
objects [241]. They are removed by a physician [241]. EMTs may remove barbs in some
jurisdictions per protocol [241]. Potential complications exist with underlying disorders [242].
Excited delirium is commonly associated with illegal drug ingestion [243]. Excited delirium is a
true emergency and warrants advanced life support [243]. Taser use with excited delirium has
been associated with dysrhythmias and cardiac arrest [245]. Have access to an AED when
responding to taser patients [245].
Radiation burns are a potential threat [245]. Incidents relate to radioactive isotopes or terrorist
attacks [245]. Determine if radiation exposure occurred and if it's ongoing [245]. There are three
types of radiation: alpha, beta, and gamma [246]. Alpha has little penetrating injury [246]. Beta
has greater penetrating power [247]. Gamma is very penetrating [249]. It passes through the
body and solid materials [249]. Most accidents involve gamma rays or X-rays [250]. People
exposed to radiation generally don't risk others [251]. In explosions, patients may be
contaminated [252]. Maintain a safe distance and wait for Hazmat for decon [252]. Most
contaminants are removed by removing clothes [253]. Once no threat exists, treat ABCs [253].
Notify the emergency department [254]. Identify the source and duration of exposure [254].
Limit your exposure duration [255]. Increase distance from the source [255]. Attempt to place
shielding between you and the source [255].
13. Dressings and Bandages
Dressings and bandages have three functions [256]. They control bleeding [256]. They prevent
further wound damage [256]. They prevent further contamination and infection [256]. Sterile
dressings are used for most wounds [257]. These include conventional sizes and small
adhesive dressings [257]. Non-adherent roller dressings are also used [257]. The universal
dressing is ideal for large open wounds [258]. Gauze pads are appropriate for smaller ones [258]
. Adhesive dressings are useful for minor wounds [259]. Occlusive dressings prevent air and
liquids from entering or exiting [259]. They are made from Vaseline gauze, aluminum foil, or
plastic [260]. They cover sucking chest wounds or abdominal eviscerations [260]. They are also
used for penetrating back wounds and neck injuries [260].
To keep dressings in place, use roller gauze, triangular bandages, tape, or self-adherence [261].
Self-adhering soft roller bandages are easiest to use [262]. Adhesive tape holds small
dressings in place [263]. It helps secure larger dressings [263]. Some people are allergic to
adhesive tape [264]. Use paper or plastic tape for these individuals [264]. Do not use elastic
bandages to secure dressings [265]. If the injury swells, the bandage may become a tourniquet
[265]. This can cause further damage [265]. Always check a limb distal to the bandage [266].
Check for signs of impaired circulation and loss of sensation [266]. Air splints and vacuum
splints stabilize broken extremities [267]. They can be used with dressings to control bleeding
[267]. If a wound continues to bleed despite direct pressure, quickly use a tourniquet [268].
14. Conclusion and Review
If a young man is struck in the forearm by a baseball [271]. He complains of pain and has slight
swelling and ecchymosis [272]. There is no external bleeding [272]. This describes a contusion
[273]. It is a contusion from blunt force trauma [274]. A severe compression injury cutting off
blood flow below the injury is compartment syndrome [275].
A 45-year-old clerk was shot in the right chest [276]. Blood is bubbling from the wound with
every breath [277]. The most immediate action is to put an occlusive dressing [278]. This
prevents air from entering the wound [278]. This is a sucking chest wound [278]. Applying ice to
a hematoma will cause vasoconstriction [279]. This decreases bleeding [279].
The primary reason for applying a sterile dressing to an open injury is to control external
bleeding [281]. While reducing infection risk is important, controlling bleeding is primary [280].
The most appropriate way to manage an open abdominal wound with protruding organs is
using a moist sterile dressing [282]. Secure it with an occlusive dressing [282]. Do not apply
pressure [283].
A 22-year-old male is attacked with a knife in his chest [284]. He is not breathing and pulseless
[284]. If a knife is present and interfering with CPR, carefully remove it [285]. Control the
bleeding and begin CPR [285].
Severe burns include full thickness burns involving hands, feet, or genitalia [287]. Burns of more
than 10% body surface area are also severe [287]. 5% or more can also be considered severe
[288].
A five-year-old boy pulled a barbecue grill on himself [289]. He has partial and full thickness
burns to his anterior chest and both arms circumferentially [290]. Using the pediatric rule of
nines, the anterior chest is 9% [292]. Each arm is 9% [292]. This totals 27% [292].
Regarding chemical burns, it is false to remove a dry chemical after flushing with water [293].
You should brush off the dry chemical first, then flush [294].
