1. Introduction to Trauma and Energy Concepts
Traumatic injuries are the leading cause of death for people younger than 44 years
old in the United States [6]. Trauma emergencies happen because of physical forces
on the body [7]. Understanding the mechanism of injury (MOI) helps predict serious
unseen injuries [7]. This awareness is called index of suspicion [7].
Traumatic injury happens when body tissues are exposed to energy beyond their
tolerance [9]. MOI describes the forces causing the injury [10]. Three key energy
concepts related to injury are potential energy, kinetic energy, and work [11]. Energy
cannot be created or destroyed, only changed [13].
Work is force over distance [13]. Forces that bend or compress tissues cause
injury [14].
kinetic energy is the energy of a moving object [14]. It relates to the object's
mass (weight) and velocity (speed) [15].
potential energy is related to the mass and gravity [15]. It's mostly linked to
falling objects [15].

2. Mechanisms of Injury: Blunt and Penetrating Trauma
Traumatic injuries are categorized as blunt trauma or penetrating trauma [18].
blunt trauma is caused by force without penetrating tissues or organs [18].
Common examples include motor vehicle crashes and falls [22]. Skin
discoloration and pain might be the only signs [23]. It's important to have a
high index of suspicion for hidden injuries [7].
penetrating trauma occurs when objects pierce the body's surface [19]. This
damages soft tissues, internal organs, and body cavities [19].
Both types can happen from various MOIs [20].

3. Motor Vehicle Crash Mechanisms and Associated Injuries
A motor vehicle crash typically involves three collisions [23]. The vehicle's condition
can indicate the MOI [24].
First collision: Vehicle against an object (e.g., a tree) [23].
Second collision: Passenger against the car's interior [24]. kinetic energy is
converted to work of stopping the body [24]. Common injuries include lower
extremity fractures, rib fractures, and head trauma [25].
Third collision: Passenger's internal organs against body structures [26].
Internal injuries may be life-threatening but not obvious externally [26].
Significant MOIs in crashes include:
Death of an occupant [27].
Severe vehicle deformity or intrusion [27].
Moderate lateral intrusion or severe rear damage [27].
Crashes with rotation involved [27].
Ejection from the vehicle [27].
Different crash types cause specific injury patterns:
Frontal crashes: Evaluate restraint systems and airbag deployment [28]. Seat
belts and airbags prevent the second collision's severity [29]. Airbags
decrease deceleration injuries to chest, face, and head [30]. Suspect extremity
and internal organ injuries despite airbags [31]. Improper restraints can cause
injuries; seat belts too low cause hip dislocations, too high cause internal
injuries, and lumbar spine fractures are possible [33].
Rear-end crashes: Known for whiplash injuries, especially without a proper
headrest [36]. Acceleration injury to the brain is possible [38]. Rear passengers
with only a lap belt may injure the thoracic and lumbar spine [38].
Lateral crashes: Common cause of death [40]. Vehicle rocks away from the
impact side [41]. Passenger sustains a whiplash-type injury [41]. Substantial
intrusion suggests lateral chest and abdominal injuries, lower extremity and
pelvis fractures, or rib fractures and organ damage [42].
Rollover crashes: Large trucks and SUVs are prone due to high center of
gravity [43]. Injuries depend on restraint use [44]. Ejection is the most common
life-threatening event [45]. Severe injuries can occur even when restrained [46].
Rotational crashes (spins): Similar to rollovers [47]. Vehicle spinning can
strike objects like utility poles [48].
Crash
Type

Lower extremity fractures, ribs, head trauma
(passenger vs interior) [25], extremity/internal
organ injuries (despite airbags) [31]

Whiplash, acceleration brain injury [36],
thoracic/lumbar spine injury (lap belt only) [38]
Lateral Vehicle struck
from the side
Whiplash, lateral chest/abdominal injuries, lower
extremity/pelvis fractures, rib/organ damage [41]
Rollover Vehicle rolls over Ejection (most common life-threat) [45], severe
injuries even when restrained [46]
Rotational Vehicle spins Injuries from striking objects during spin [48]
4. Other Blunt Trauma Mechanisms: Pedestrian, Bicycle,
Motorcycle, and Falls
Other blunt trauma mechanisms also cause significant injuries.
Car versus Pedestrian: Injuries are often graphic and obvious [49]. Serious
unseen injuries are also possible [49]. Key factors include vehicle speed, if the
patient was thrown and how far, where they landed, and if they were pulled
under the vehicle [50]. Evaluate the striking vehicle for damage [51]. ALS should
be called for significant MOI [52].
Car versus Bicycle: Evaluate similarly to car versus pedestrian crashes [53].
Assess bicycle damage and position [53]. Inspect the helmet for damage [53].
Presume spinal cord injury until ruled out at the hospital [53]. Spinal
immobilization is crucial [53].
Car versus Motorcycle: Helmets offer protection but not against severe
cervical injury [54]. Leather or abrasion-resistant clothing protects against
road abrasion but not blunt trauma [55]. Boots protect feet [55]. When
assessing, look for motorcycle deformity, side of most damage, skid distance,
damage to other objects, and helmet deformity [56]. There are four types of
motorcycle impacts:
Head-on: Motorcycle stops, rider continues forward [57].
Angular: Motorcycle strikes object at an angle; rider's lower extremity is
crushed [58].
Ejection: Rider travels at high speed until stopped by an object or road
drag [59].
Controlled crash: Rider separates from the motorcycle before impact
(laying the bike down) [60].
Falls: Injury potential relates to the fall height [62]. Greater height means
greater potential energy [62]. A fall over 20 feet is significant [63]. Internal
injuries are the greatest threat [63]. Landing on feet may lessen internal
injuries but cause serious lower extremity and pelvis injuries [64]. Spinal
injuries are possible [64]. Consider fall height, surface struck, body part that
hit first, and energy displacement path [64].
5. Penetrating Trauma: Low, Medium, and High Velocity
penetrating trauma is the second leading cause of death after blunt trauma [66]. It
can be caused by low, medium, or high energy impacts.
Low energy penetrating trauma: Caused by objects like knives or ice picks
[67]. Injuries are from sharp edges moving through tissue, close to the object's
path [68]. Knives moved internally can cause more damage than external
wounds suggest [69].
Medium and high velocity penetrating trauma: Usually caused by bullets [70]
. The bullet's path can be unpredictable; it may flatten, tumble, or ricochet [71].
The path is called the trajectory [72]. Fragmentation increases damage [72].
cavitation results from rapid tissue/fluid pressure changes [72].
Temporary cavitation: Tissue stretching from pressure changes [73].
Permanent cavitation: Injury closer to the bullet path that remains after
passage [73].
The distance and injury severity depend on the weapon type [74]. Air resistance
(drag) slows the projectile, reducing penetration depth and energy [75]. The damaged
area from medium/high velocity projectiles is much larger than the projectile's
diameter [76]. Exit wounds are often larger than entrance wounds for this reason [77].
Energy's ability to cause damage is more about speed than mass [78]. The type of
tissue the projectile passes through significantly impacts injury seriousness [79].
Velocity Characteristics Damage Mechanism
Low Velocity Objects like knives or
ice picks [67]
Sharp edges moving through tissue
[68]
Medium/High
Velocity
Usually bullets [70] Trajectory, fragmentation, cavitation
(temporary and permanent) [72]
6. Blast Injuries: Mechanisms and Affected Tissues
Blast injuries are seen in civilian settings from explosions in mines, shipyards,
chemical plants, and terrorist activities [81]. There are four mechanisms of blast
injuries [82].
Primary blast injuries: Caused entirely by the blast's pressure wave [83].
Secondary blast injuries: Damage from flying debris hitting the body [84].
tertiary blast injuries: Victim is thrown by the explosion force against a
stationary object [85].
Quaternary blast injuries: Burns from hot gases, respiratory injury from toxic
gas, crush injury from building collapse, suffocation, poisoning, or other
medical emergencies/contamination [86].
Most survivors have a combination of these four injury types [88]. Tissues containing
air are most susceptible to pressure changes, like the middle ear, lungs, and GI tract
[89].
The ear is the most sensitive [90].
pulmonary blasts are lung trauma from close exposure to detonations [91].
pneumothorax is common and may need field decompression [92]. arterial
air emboli are concerning pulmonary blast injuries, occurring when air enters
lung blood vessels, potentially causing vision issues, behavioral changes,
consciousness changes, or neurological signs [93].
Solid organs are somewhat protected but can be injured by secondary
missiles or being thrown [94].
Neurologic injuries and head trauma are the most common causes of death
from blast injuries [94]. Extremity injuries, including traumatic amputations,
are also frequent [95].

suffocation, poisoning [86]
7. Multi-System Trauma and Pre-hospital Care Principles
multi-system trauma involves injury to more than one body system [96]. Examples
include head/spine trauma, chest/abdomen injuries, or chest/multiple extremity
injuries [97]. Patients with multi-system trauma have high morbidity and mortality [98].
Rapid transport and medical control contact are important [97].
The golden principles of pre-hospital trauma care guide management [98]:
Ensure safety: Your safety first, then crew safety, then patient safety [98].
Determine the need for additional personnel and equipment [100].
Evaluate the mechanism of injury [100].
Identify and manage life threats [101].
Focus on patient care [101].
Hemorrhage control is the highest priority [101].
Access and manage the airway, including ventilatory support and highflow
oxygen [102]. Maintain spinal restriction [102]. This is the second priority
[102].
Ensure other shock therapy is completed [102].
Protect the spine and proceed with spinal immobilization if indicated [102].
Transport the patient immediately to the appropriate facility [103]. Definitive
care for multi-system trauma often requires surgery [104]. Scene time should
be 10 minutes or less [104].
During transport, obtain a SAMPLE history and complete the secondary
assessment [105].
Consider advanced life support (ALS) intercept or air medical transport
[105].
8. Patient Assessment and Injury Patterns by Body Region
For patients with a significant MOI and serious/critical condition, perform a rapid
physical exam [107]. Focus on the chief complaint while assessing the whole patient
[108]. Common injury patterns are seen in different body regions.
Head injuries: Disability and unseen brain injury can occur [110]. Bleeding or
swelling inside the skull is often life-threatening [111]. Include frequent
neurologic examinations [111]. Signs and symptoms may appear minutes or
hours later [111].
Neck and Throat injuries: Airway problems can quickly become lifethreatening
[112]. Frequent physical exams, including DCAP-BTLS
(Deformities, Contusions, Abrasions, Punctures/Penetrations, Burns,
Tenderness, Lacerations, Swelling), are essential [113]. Assess for jugular vein
distension and tracheal deviation [114]. Swelling can impede blood flow to
the brain [114]. Crushing injuries to the upper neck can fracture airway
cartilage [115].
Chest injuries: The chest contains the heart, lungs, and large vessels [116].
Many life-threatening injuries are possible [116].
Broken ribs can hinder breathing [117].
Bruising to the heart can cause irregular rhythms [117].
Torn large vessels can cause massive unseen bleeding [117].
Air collection between the lung and chest wall is a pneumothorax [118].
Blood collection in the chest is a hemothorax [118].
A penetrating chest wound is an open chest wound [119].
If untreated, shock may occur [120]. Assess the chest every five minutes [120].
Assessment includes DCAP-BTLS, lung sounds, and chest rise/fall [121].
Abdomen injuries: The abdomen holds vital organs with high blood flow [122].
Solid organs (liver, spleen, pancreas, kidneys) can tear, lacerate, or
fracture, causing serious bleeding [123].
Hollow organs (stomach, intestines, bladder) can rupture, leaking toxic
digestive chemicals and causing life-threatening infection [125].
Ruptured blood vessels can cause serious unseen bleeding [126].

9. Transport Decisions and Trauma Center Levels
Scene time survival is critical for trauma patients [127]. On-scene time for critically
injured patients should be less than 10 minutes [127].
Criteria for identifying a critically injured patient include:
Dangerous mechanism of injury [128].
Decreased level of consciousness [129].
Threats to the airway, breathing, or circulation [129].
Very young or very old patients, or those with chronic illness [129].
Trauma centers are classified into levels one through four [130].
Level one: Provides every aspect of trauma care, most resources [131].
Level two: Provides initial definitive care [132].
Level three: Provides assessment, resuscitation, emergency care, and
stabilization [133].
Level four: Provides advanced trauma life support [133].
Criteria for using emergency air medical services for trauma patients:
Extended time to access or extricate a remote/trapped patient [135].
Distance to a trauma center is more than 20-25 miles [135].
Patient needs advanced care, and no ALS ground ambulance is available [135].
Traffic or hospital availability makes ground transport to a trauma center
unlikely [136].
Multiple trauma patients overwhelm nearby hospitals [137].
EMS system requires transport to the nearest hospital instead of bypassing to
a trauma center, delaying definitive surgical care [138].
Mass casualty event [139].
Trauma centers are categorized as adult or pediatric, not necessarily both [140].
Modes of transport are ground or air [141]. Ground units are staffed by EMTs and
paramedics [142]. Air or critical care units are staffed by critical care nurses and
paramedics [142]. Special considerations during transport include staying calm,
completing a thorough assessment, correcting life-threatening injuries, doing no
harm, and contacting ALS backup or medical control if needed [142].
