1. Introduction to Medical, Legal, and Ethical Issues in Emergency
Care
This report covers medical, legal, and ethical issues relevant to EMTs [1].
It will explain the ethical responsibilities and medical legal directives and
guidelines for EMTs [2].
Key concepts include confidentiality, consent to treat, refusal of care, and
advance directives [3].
Topics like organ donor systems, evidence preservation, and end-of-life
issues are also discussed [4].
A basic principle is to do no further harm [6].
2. Consent in Emergency Medical Care
Consent is the permission to render care [9].
A patient must give consent for treatment [9].
The foundation of consent is decision-making capacity [11].
This means the patient can understand and process information [11].
The patient can also make an informed choice [11].
Patient autonomy is the patient's right to make decisions about their health
[12].
Factors for determining decision-making capacity include intellectual
capacity, legal age, and impairment from alcohol, drugs, injury, or illness [13].
Express consent means the patient acknowledges they want care and
transport [14].
For consent to be valid, it must be informed consent [15].
You must explain the nature of treatment, risks, benefits, alternatives,
and consequences of refusing care [15].
implied consent applies to patients who are unconscious or incapable of
making a rational decision [16].
This is based on the emergency doctrine [19].
It is used when a serious threat to life exists [17].
Try to get consent from a spouse or relative if possible [20].
Involuntary consent applies to patients who are mentally ill, in a behavioral
crisis, or developmentally delayed [21].
Consent should be obtained from a guardian or conservator [22].
Local provisions may allow for protective custody statutes [23].
For minors, the parent or legal guardian usually gives consent [25].
Some states allow emancipated minors to give consent [25].
emancipated minors may be married, in the armed services, or parents
[26].
School teachers or officials may provide consent for injuries at school or
camp [27].
In a true emergency with no consent available, consent is implied for
minors [28].
Forcible restraint is necessary for combative patients who are a danger to
themselves or others [29].
forcible restraint is legally permissible with medical control
authorization and law enforcement assistance [30].
Restraining without legal authority can lead to civil and criminal penalties
[30].
Do not remove restraints en route unless they pose a risk [31].
Consider ALS backup for chemical restraint [32].
Adults with decision-making capacity have the right to refuse treatment
[34].
They can withdraw from treatment at any time [35].
Refusal of treatment calls require caution and involvement of medical
control [36].
The decision to refuse should be based on information provided by the
EMT [37].
When treatment is refused, assess the patient's ability to make an
informed decision [38].
If the patient is confused or delusional, you cannot assume the refusal is
informed [39].
Providing treatment is often more defensible than failing to treat [40].
Ensure your safety with law enforcement if needed [40].
Encourage the patient to permit treatment and call back if their condition
worsens or they change their mind [41].
Advise the patient to contact their own physician [43].
Ask the patient to sign a refusal of treatment form with a witness [43].
Thoroughly document all refusals [44].

3. Confidentiality and HIPAA
Communication between the EMT and patient is confidential [45].
Confidential information includes history, assessment findings, and
treatments [46].
Inappropriately releasing this information is breach of confidentiality [47].
Records can usually be released only with a patient signed release, a legal
subpoena, or for billing purposes [48].
HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) strengthened
privacy laws [49].
HIPAA protects patient information obtained during medical treatment [51].
This is called Protected Health Information (PHI) [52].
PHI includes medical information and identifiable information [53].
Failure to follow HIPAA can result in civil or criminal action [54].
The general public is often allowed to record identifying patient information
[55].
EMTs should avoid associating with their agency on social media while off
duty unless an official spokesperson [56].
Conduct yourself with the same professionalism online as on duty [58].
Recognize that free speech has limitations [60].
4. Advanced Directives and End-of-Life Issues
advanced directives are written documents specifying medical treatment
for a competent patient who becomes unable to make decisions [66].
A Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) order gives permission to withhold
resuscitation [63].
A DNR does not mean do not treat [64].
You are obligated to provide supportive measures even with a DNR [65].
advanced directives are often called a living will or healthcare directive [66].
Valid DNR orders must meet specific requirements [67].
These requirements include a clear statement of the medical problem,
signatures of the patient/guardian and physician/healthcare provider, and
an expiration date within the preceding 12 months [67].
You may encounter Physician's Orders for Sustaining Treatment (POST) or
Medical Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (MOLST) forms for terminally
ill patients [70].
These forms explicitly describe acceptable interventions and must be
signed by an authorized medical provider [70].
Contact medical control if you encounter these documents [71].
Patients may name surrogates called Durable Powers of Attorney for
Healthcare or healthcare proxies [72].
Determining the cause of death is a medical responsibility of a physician
[73].
presumptive signs of death include unresponsiveness, lack of
pulse/heartbeat, absence of chest rise/fall, no reflexes, no pupillary activity,
no blood pressure, profound cyanosis, and decreased body temperature [74].
definitive signs of death are obvious mortal damage, dependent lividity, rigor
mortis, algor mortis, and putrefaction [75].
dependent lividity is blood settling to the lowest point of the body [76].
rigor mortis is the stiffening of body muscles, occurring 2 to 12 hours after
death [78].
algor mortis is the cooling of the body [80].
putrefaction is the decomposition of body tissues, occurring 40 to 96 hours
after death [81].
The medical examiner or coroner must be notified in certain cases [82].
These cases include dead on arrival, death without previous medical care,
physician unable to state cause of death, suicide, violent death, poisoning,
accident, suspicion of criminal act, and infant/child deaths [82].
Limit your disturbance of a death scene [84].
Keep thorough notes if emergency care is initiated at a death scene [84].
Treat potential organ donors the same as any other patient [85].
Your priority is to save the patient's life [85].
Organ donor information may be on a donor card or driver's license [85].
medical identification insignia (bracelets, necklaces, etc.) indicate
conditions like DNRs, allergies, or serious medical conditions [85].
Valid DNR Requirement Description
Clear statement of the patient's
medical problem
Specifies the patient's condition
Signature of the patient or legal
guardian
Provides authorization from the patient or
their representative
Signature of one or more physicians
or licensed HCPs
Confirms the medical order by a qualified
professional
Dated within the preceding 12
months
Ensures the order is current
5. Legal Aspects of EMT Practice
scope of practice outlines the care you are able to provide [88].
It is usually defined by state law [88].
The medical director further defines the scope of practice through protocols
or standing orders [89].
Authorization for treatment comes from the medical director [90].
This can be online (radio/telephone) or offline (standing orders/protocol)
[90].
Carrying out procedures outside the scope of practice can be considered
negligence [90].
The standard of care is the manner in which you must act or behave [91].
It is defined as how a person with similar training would act under similar
circumstances [92].
Standards of care are established by local custom, law (statutes, ordinances,
regulations, case law), professional/institutional standards, EMS agency
rules, textbooks, and state medical practices acts [93].
duty to act is an individual's responsibility to provide patient care [97].
Once your ambulance responds or treatment begins, you have a legal duty to
act [97].
If off duty, you are generally not legally obligated to stop and assist [98].
You must know local laws and policies regarding duty to act [99].
negligence is the failure to provide the same care as a person with similar
training in the same situation [101].
Four factors must be present for negligence to apply: duty, breach of duty,
damages, and causation [102].
Duty is the obligation to provide care [104].
Breach of duty means the EMT did not act within the standard of care
[104].
Damages means the patient was physically or physiologically harmed
[105].
Causation is a cause and effect relationship between the breach of duty
and the damages [106].
res ipsa loquitur means the EMT can be liable if an injury occurred, the EMT
was in control, and injuries don't generally occur without negligence [108].
negligence per se applies when conduct violates a statute, like an EMT
performing an ALS skill outside their scope that causes injury [108].
torts are civil wrongs, such as defamation or invasion of privacy [109].
abandonment is the unilateral termination of care without the patient's
consent or provision for continued care by a competent professional [111].
Once care begins, you must continue until an equally competent provider
assumes responsibility [112].
abandonment can occur at the scene or in the emergency department [113].
Obtain a signature on your patient record from the person accepting
transfer of care [113].
Assault is unlawfully placing a person in fear of immediate bodily harm,
including threatening restraint [114].
Battery is unlawfully touching a person, including providing medical care
without consent [116].
Kidnapping is seizing, confining, abducting, or carrying away by force,
including transporting a patient against their will [117].
False imprisonment is unauthorized confinement of a person [118].
Serious legal problems can arise if a patient rescinds consent and is confined
[118].
Defamation is the communication of false information that damages a
person's reputation [119].
Libel is written defamation [119].
Slander is spoken defamation [119].
Statements on your run report should be accurate, relevant, and factual [119].
good samaritan laws offer immunity for errors made in good faith when
reasonably helping another person without expectation of compensation and
acting within your training, provided you did not act in a grossly negligent
manner [119].
Gross negligence is willful or reckless disregard for a duty or standard of
care [120].
Immunity statutes may apply to EMS systems that are not governmental
agencies [121].
sovereign immunity limits liabilities for governmental entities [121].
6. Documentation and Reporting Requirements
Compile complete and accurate records of all incidents [121].
Records are an important safeguard against legal complications [121].
If an action was not recorded, the court may perceive it as not performed
[122].
Incomplete or untidy reports suggest incomplete and inexpert care [122].
nemsis is the National EMS Information System [123].
nemsis allows for the collection, storage, and sharing of standardized EMS
data [124].
Some states have special mandatory reporting requirements for healthcare
providers [125].
Mandatory reporting requirements may vary by state [126].
These include reporting child abuse, elder abuse, and abuse of at-risk
adults [127].
Other mandatory reports include injuries during a felony, drug-related
injuries, childbirth, attempted suicides, dog bites, certain communicable
diseases, assaults, and domestic violence [128].
Reporting is also mandatory for sexual assault/rape, exposures to
infectious diseases, transport of patients in restraints, crime scenes, and
the deceased [130].
7. Ethical Responsibilities and the EMT in Court
EMTs have ethical responsibilities as healthcare providers [131].
Ethics is a philosophy of right and wrong, moral duties, and ideal
professional behavior [132].
Morality is a code of conduct affecting character, conduct, and
consequence [133].
bioethics addresses ethical issues in healthcare practice [133].
EMTs will face ethical dilemmas requiring evaluation and application of
ethical standards [134].
Applied ethics is how ethical principles are incorporated into professional
conduct [135].
Allow rules, laws, and policies to guide your decision-making [135].
EMTs can be involved in court as a witness or a defendant [136].
Cases can be civil or criminal [136].
If subpoenaed, immediately notify your service director and legal counsel
[137].
As a witness, remain neutral and review the run report beforehand [138].
As a defendant, an attorney is required, often supplied by your service [139].
In a civil suit, defenses may include statutes of limitations, governmental
immunity, and contributory negligence [140].
Statutes of limitations are the time frame for starting a case [140].
Governmental immunity may protect municipalities or entities from
lawsuits or limit monetary judgments [140].
Contributory negligence is when the plaintiff's conduct contributed to
their injuries [142].
Discovery is when both sides obtain information, including depositions (oral
questions) and interrogatories (written questions) [143].
Most cases are settled after discovery and do not go to trial [146].
If a case goes to trial, damages can be awarded [147].
Compensatory damages compensate the plaintiff for injuries [148].
Punitive damages deter the defendant from repeating behavior and are
for reckless or intentional actions [149].
If a judgment is against you, your service or insurance carrier usually pays
[151].
An EMT charged with a criminal offense should immediately get an
experienced criminal attorney [152].
