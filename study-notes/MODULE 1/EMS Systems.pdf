1. Introduction to EMS Systems
This report provides an overview of ems systems.
It covers their history and the roles and responsibilities of EMTs.
The main focus is understanding the structure and function of emergency
medical services.
It also highlights the EMT's place within this system.
EMS is defined as a system.
It consists of teams of healthcare professionals.
This system provides emergency care and transportation.
EMS is governed by state laws [10].

4. Components of the EMS System
The EMS Agenda 2050 outlines five components of the EMS system [68].
These components include comprehensive, quality and convenient care [69].
Evidence-based clinical care is another component [69].
Efficient, well-rounded care is also included [69].
Preventative care is a key part [69].
Comprehensive and easily accessible patient records are essential [69].
Public access ensures easy access to help in an emergency [70].
The 911 system is part of public safety [71].
An emergency medical dispatch (EMD) system helps dispatchers give
medical instructions [72].
Mobile apps can alert lay people trained in CPR to cardiac arrests [73].
Human resources focuses on the people who deliver care [74].
The EMS Agenda 2050 encourages an environment where talented people
want to work [75].
Medical direction is provided by a physician [76].
The medical director authorizes EMTs to provide care in the field [76].
medical directors are liaisons between the medical community and EMTs [77].
Appropriate care is described in standing orders and protocols [77].
protocols are a comprehensive guide for the EMT's scope of practice [78].
standing orders are part of protocols [78].
They designate what the EMT must do for a specific complaint [78].
Providers do not need to consult medical direction before implementing
standing orders [79].
Medical control can be offline (indirect) or online (direct) [80].
Offline control involves standing orders, training, or supervision [80].
Online control is a physician's direct order over the phone or radio [81].
Legislation and regulation ensure training, protocols, and practices follow
state laws [82].
A senior EMS official manages administrative tasks and daily operations [83].
Integration of healthcare services means pre-hospital care continues in the
emergency department [84].
Mobile integrated healthcare (MIH) uses the pre-hospital spectrum for
healthcare delivery [85].
MIH evolved to improve access to affordable healthcare [85].
Healthcare in the MIH model is provided in the community [86].
This is done by an integrated team of professionals [86].
This branch uses additional training levels for EMS providers [87].
This includes community paramedicine [88].
Experienced paramedics receive advanced training for community services
[88].
They can perform health evaluations and monitor chronic illnesses [89].
They can obtain lab samples and administer immunizations [89].
Information systems use computer systems to document patient care [90].
Electronically stored information is used to improve care [90].
Evaluation means the medical director is responsible for quality control [91].
Adopting a just culture promotes fairness and accountability [92].
continuous quality improvement (cqi) reviews and audits the EMS system
[93].
CQI identifies areas for improvement and assigns remedial training [94].
Minimizing errors is the goal of CQI [95].
It uses a plan, do, study, act cycle [95].
Patient safety involves minimizing medical errors [95].
This requires efforts from both the EMS agency and personnel [96].
System finance varies depending on the organization [97].
Personnel can be paid, volunteer, or a mix [98].
EMTs may gather insurance information or secure signatures on hipaa notices
[99].
They may obtain permission to bill health insurance [99].
The ET3 pilot program reimburses EMS for appropriate patient care [100].
It sets up payment for transport to alternative destinations [101].
It also covers on-scene treatment with no transport [101].
Education systems involve licensed instructors in most states [102].
Training programs must follow national standards from CoAEMSP and
CAAHEP [103].
Continuing education and refresher courses maintain and update EMT skills
[105].
Prevention and public education focus on public health [106].
Public health examines the population's health needs [106].
The goal is preventing health problems [106].
EMS works with public health agencies in two ways [107].
Primary prevention strategies prevent events from happening [107].
Examples include pool safety education and car seat installation [107].
Secondary prevention occurs after an event [108].
It aims to decrease the effects of the event [109].
Helmets and seat belts are examples of secondary prevention [109].
Examples of public health accomplishments include vaccination programs and
seat belt laws [110].
5. Roles and Responsibilities of an EMT
EMTs are healthcare professionals [116].
Roles include keeping vehicles and equipment ready [117].
Ensuring safety is crucial: self, partner, patient, bystanders [117].
Being familiar with emergency vehicle operation is needed [117].
EMTs should be on-scene leaders [117].
They perform an evaluation of the scene [117].
Calling for additional resources when needed is a role [117].
Gaining access to patients is necessary [117].
Performing a patient assessment is a key task [117].
Giving emergency medical care while awaiting resources is essential [117].
Administrative support is also required [117].
Constant professional development is important [118].
Cultivating and sustaining community relations is a role [118].
Giving back to the profession is encouraged [118].
Professional attributes include integrity, acting consistently and honestly
[119].
Empathy involves being aware of others' needs [121].
Self-motivation means solving problems without direction [121].
Appearance and hygiene project trust and professionalism [121].
Self-confidence is knowing what you know and don't know [121].
Being able to ask for help is part of self-confidence [121].
Time management involves performing or delegating tasks efficiently [122].
Communication means understanding and being understood [122].
Teamwork and diplomacy involve working with others and respecting them
[122].
Respect is holding others in high regard [122].
Patient advocacy keeps the patient's needs central to care [123].
Careful delivery of care means paying attention to details [123].
It ensures care is done as safely as possible [123].
Every patient is entitled to compassion and respect [124].
EMTs are bound by patient confidentiality [125].
Patient privacy must be protected [125].
Findings or disclosures should only be discussed with treating personnel [126].
Limited disclosures may be made as required by law, like to the police [126].
Protection of patient privacy is highlighted by hipaa [127].
6. Licensure and Certification Requirements
Successful completion of the EMT course allows taking national or state
certification exams [11].
After passing the certification exam, one is eligible for state licensure [12].
Licensure is how the state ensures an applicant's competency [13].
This process allows states to manage who can be a healthcare provider [14].
Licensure requirements differ by state but generally include [27]:
A high school diploma or equivalent [27].
Proof of immunization [27].
Successful background check and drug screening [27].
A valid driver's license [27].
Successful completion of a recognized BLS CPR course [28].
Successful completion of a state-approved EMT course [28].
Successful completion of state-recognized written and practical exams
[28].
Demonstrating necessary mental and physical abilities [28].
Compliance with other state, local, and employer provisions [28].
The americans with disabilities act (ada) protects people with disabilities
[29].
It prevents denial of access to state or local government programs [30].
It prohibits employers from denying equal employment to the disabled [31].
Title 1 protects EMTs with disabilities seeking employment [32].
Employers may need to adjust processes or modify the work environment [33].
Personal background information is checked based on state criminal
requirements [34].
States have requirements prohibiting individuals with misdemeanors or
felonies from becoming EMS providers [35].
7. Quality Improvement and Patient Safety
The EMT has a role in the quality improvement process [2].
The medical director is responsible for maintaining quality control [91].
This involves adopting a just culture [92].
A just culture promotes a learning culture [92].
It balances fairness and accountability [92].
continuous quality improvement (cqi) involves reviews and audits [93].
CQI identifies areas for improvement and assigns remedial training [94].
The goal of CQI is minimizing errors [95].
It uses a plan, do, study, act cycle [95].
Patient safety aims to minimize medical errors [95].
Errors can result from rules-based, knowledge-based, or skills-based failures
[95].
Minimizing errors requires efforts from both the EMS agency and personnel
[96].
8. Research and Evidence-Based Decision-Making
An EMT has an impact on research and evidence-based decision-making
[5].
EMS research helps determine the shape and impact of EMS on the
community [112].
evidence-based medicine focuses on procedures proven useful for
improving patient outcomes [113].
Many ems systems consult national model EMS clinical guidelines [114].
These guidelines are from the National Association of EMS Officials [114].
The guidelines are based on a review of current research and expert
consensus [115].
