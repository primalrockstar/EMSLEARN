## Chapter 1: EMS Systems

### Overview
Explores the origins, evolution, and structure of EMS systems, including integration with health care, levels of providers, and the role of medical direction.

### Learning Objectives
- Outline the history and goals of EMS.
- Identify components and organization of EMS systems.
- Describe provider roles and responsibilities.
- Explain the importance of quality improvement.

### Key Terms
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| EMS | Emergency Medical Services: a system for prehospital emergency care. |
| Medical Director | Physician providing clinical oversight of EMS. |
| NHTSA | National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, sets EMS standards. |
| EMR | Emergency Medical Responder. |
| EMT | Emergency Medical Technician. |

### Major Concepts & Guidelines
- EMS systems are public safety networks integrating emergency response, care, and transport.
- Providers are classified by training: EMR, EMT, AEMT, Paramedic.
- Medical direction ensures adherence to protocols and standards.
- Quality improvement is ongoing and essential for patient care.

### Procedures / Protocols
- **Activation:** Call 911, dispatch triage, appropriate resource deployment.
- **Quality Improvement:** Participate in case reviews and feedback sessions.

### Assessment & Clinical Pearls
- Scene safety is the first step before any intervention.
- Communication with dispatch and medical control is key for coordinated care.

### Documentation Standards
- Record times, findings, treatments, and patient outcome.
- Maintain clarity and accuracy for legal and clinical use.

### Case Example
> EMS is dispatched for a collapsed patient in a store. What information should be relayed to medical control? What are initial EMS priorities?

### Quick Reference Table
| Symptom/Sign | Possible Cause | Action/Intervention |
|--------------|---------------|---------------------|
| Unresponsive | Cardiac Arrest | Initiate CPR, notify ALS, rapid transport |

### Review Questions
1. What are the four major components of an EMS system?
2. Who is responsible for clinical oversight in EMS?
3. Why is documentation important?

## Chapter 2: Workforce Safety and Wellness

### Overview
Covers EMS provider safety, scene assessment, infection control, mental health, and stress management in emergency situations.

### Learning Objectives
- Recognize common scene hazards.
- Explain PPE and infection control practices.
- Identify signs of stress and burnout.
- Describe strategies for EMS wellness.

### Key Terms
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| PPE | Personal Protective Equipment. |
| BSI | Body Substance Isolation. |
| CISD | Critical Incident Stress Debriefing. |
| PTSD | Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. |

### Major Concepts & Guidelines
- Scene safety: Assess for hazards (fire, chemicals, violence) before entering.
- Always use PPE: gloves, masks, eye protection.
- Stress management: regular debriefings, peer support, professional counseling.
- Maintain physical health: sleep, nutrition, hydration.

### Procedures / Protocols
- **Infection Control:** Use gloves, wash hands, dispose of sharps properly.
- **Stress Management:** Participate in CISD, cultivate support networks.

### Assessment & Clinical Pearls
- PPE should be donned before contact with the patient.
- Early recognition of emotional stress can prevent burnout.

### Documentation Standards
- Document exposures and safety incidents in the PCR.

### Case Example
> Arriving at a multi-vehicle accident, EMS notes spilled fuel and panicked bystanders. What steps should be taken for provider safety?

### Quick Reference Table
| Hazard | Control Measure | Action |
|--------|----------------|--------|
| Blood exposure | Gloves, gowns | Clean/wash, report incident |

### Review Questions
1. What is the first step in personal safety at a scene?
2. List three types of PPE commonly used in EMS.
3. What support resources are available for EMS stress?

## Chapter 3: Medical, Legal and Ethical Issues

### Overview
Examines legal concepts in EMS (consent, refusal, negligence), ethical principles, confidentiality (HIPAA), and mandatory reporting.

### Learning Objectives
- Define and differentiate types of consent.
- Recognize legal responsibilities in patient care.
- Apply ethical decision-making in practice.
- Explain the importance of confidentiality.

### Key Terms
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Consent | Permission to treat. |
| Implied Consent | Treatment allowed when patient can't consent. |
| Negligence | Failure to provide appropriate care. |
| HIPAA | Law protecting patient information. |

### Major Concepts & Guidelines
- Types of consent: expressed, implied, parental.
- Refusal of care: document thoroughly, obtain witness, inform about risks.
- Mandatory reporting: abuse, certain injuries, infectious diseases.

### Procedures / Protocols
- **Consent:** Explain care, obtain permission or use implied consent if unconscious.
- **Refusal:** Document patient decision, witness, and risk explanation.

### Assessment & Clinical Pearls
- Never force care unless legally allowed.
- Protect privacyâ€”share information only as needed for care.

### Documentation Standards
- Record all refusals, consent, and patient statements.

### Case Example
> An adult patient refuses EMS treatment after a seizure. What legal steps are required?

### Quick Reference Table
| Situation | Legal/Ethical Issue | Action |
|-----------|---------------------|--------|
| Minor injury | Parental consent | Obtain parent's permission |

### Review Questions
1. What are the different types of consent in EMS?
2. Define negligence in the EMS context.
3. What must be documented for a refusal of care?
