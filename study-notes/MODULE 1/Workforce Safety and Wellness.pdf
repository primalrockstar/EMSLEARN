Using appropriate measures for infectious
diseases is essential.
[2]
Preventing Injuries Avoiding on-the-job injuries is a priority.
[2]
To effectively care for others, emergency medical technicians (EMTs) must prioritize
their own well-being [2]. Recognizing hazards to health, safety, and well-being is very
important [3]. These hazards include personal neglect, environmental threats, humanmade
threats, and mental and physical stress [4]. The emotional well-being of an
employee and the patient are intertwined, especially in high-stress rescues [5].
wellness is the active pursuit of a good state of health [10]. resilience is the capacity
to cope with and recover from distress [11].
2. Strategies for Enhancing Resilience and Managing Stress
Practices that can help increase resilience include eating healthy and maintaining a
well-balanced diet [12]. Ensuring a minimum of seven to nine hours of sleep is also
important [12]. Strengthening positive relationships with family and friends can build
resilience [12]. Building relationships with peers and colleagues is also recommended
[12]. Incorporating daily stretching, movement, and exercise helps [12]. Building habits
of mindfulness and positivity contributes to resilience [12].
Strategies can be used to manage stress [13]. Minimizing or eliminating stressors as
much as possible is helpful [14]. Changing partners to avoid negative personalities or
changing work hours can reduce stress [15]. Cutting back on overtime might also be
an option [15]. Changing your attitude about the stressor can make a difference [16].
Talking about feelings with people you trust is important [16]. Seeking professional
counseling is an option if needed [17]. Do not obsess over frustrating situations that
are unable to change [18]. Focus on delivering high-quality care [18]. Adopting a
philosophical outlook can be beneficial [19]. Expanding your social support system
beyond co-workers helps manage stress [20]. Developing friends and interests
outside of emergency services is recommended [20]. Limiting the intake of caffeine,
alcohol, and tobacco use is also advised [20].

Exercise early but allow time to
relax; Nap early and avoid
heavy pre-sleep meals; Balance
fluid intake; Establish calming
pre-sleep routine; Sleep when
truly tired; Keep sleep schedule
consistent; Expose to natural
light during waking hours.
Eating regular, well-balanced meals is important [21]. Limit consumption of sugar, fat,
sodium, and alcohol [21]. complex carbohydrates like pasta and rice are reliable for
long-term energy [22]. Fats can lead to obesity and cardiac disease if eaten too much
[23]. Maintaining adequate fluid intake is crucial [24]. Water is generally the best fuel
available [24].
Regular exercise enhances good nutrition and hydration [25]. Being in good physical
condition makes handling stress easier [26]. Engage in at least 30 minutes of
moderate or vigorous activity at least five days per week [27]. Include cardiovascular
endurance, muscle strength building, and muscle flexibility [27].
Adults should sleep a minimum of seven to nine hours [28]. Half of EMS personnel get
less than six hours of sleep [29]. They report severe mental and physical fatigue [29].
Short-term effects of sleep deprivation include medical errors and vehicle crashes
[30]. Long-term effects include hypertension, sleep apnea, and diabetes [31].
Increased stress contributes to sleep deprivation and fatigue [31]. Guidelines for
fatigue management have been developed [32]. EMS personnel should work shifts
shorter than 24 hours [35]. They should have access to caffeine and opportunity to
nap [36]. Education and training can help mitigate fatigue [38]. Recommendations to
combat fatigue include adequate sleep and taking 20 to 30 minute naps [39]. Increase
physical activity and be careful about caffeine consumption [39]. Engage in mental
exercise [39]. To improve sleep quality, avoid caffeine, nicotine, and other chemicals
before bed [40]. Ensure your sleep environment is dark, quiet, and cool [41]. Exercise
early but relax before trying to sleep [41]. Nap early and avoid heavy pre-sleep meals
[41]. Balance fluid intake and establish a calming pre-sleep routine [41]. Sleep when
truly tired and keep your schedule consistent [41]. Expose yourself to natural light
during waking hours [41].
4. Disease Prevention and Health Promotion
Disease prevention focuses on medical care and prevention to avoid or reduce
disease effects [42]. health promotion focuses on personal practices and social habits
to improve health [43]. Smoking, vaping, or chewing nicotine can lead to
cardiovascular and respiratory disease [44]. Smokeless tobacco is associated with
cancers of the throat, mouth, and pancreas [45]. Vaping has been shown to cause
cardiovascular and respiratory illness [46]. Strategies for quitting nicotine include
creating a plan and setting a quit date [47]. Tell a friend, family, or co-worker your plan
[47]. Remove tobacco and vaping products from your surroundings [47]. Talk to your
doctor about resources that can help you quit [47].
An acceptable amount of alcohol is one drink per day for women and two for men [48]
. Excessive alcohol use causes about 88,000 deaths per year in the United States [49]
. It also costs more than $200 billion per year [49]. Approximately 75 percent of the
cost is due to binge drinking [50]. Excessive alcohol use can adversely affect
cardiovascular, hepatic, immune, and central nervous systems [50]. It may increase
the risk of developing certain cancers [50].
Both prescription and illegal drugs may be abused or misused [51]. According to the
CDC, drug abuse costs the United States more than 190 billion dollars annually [52].
Many EMS agencies drug test their employees [53]. Balancing work, family, and health
is important [53]. When possible, rotate your schedule to give yourself time off [53].
You need to take vaccinations [54]. If the stress of work is too much, seek help [54].
5. Infectious and Communicable Diseases: Risks and Prevention
Term Definition Source
Pathogen A microorganism capable of causing
disease.
[60]
Contamination Presence of an infectious organism or
foreign body on or within objects, wounds,
or a patient's body.
[61]
Exposure Contact with blood, body fluids, tissues, or
airborne particles that may allow disease
transmission.
[61]
Personal Protective
Equipment (PPE)
Protective equipment worn by an individual
to prevent exposure to a pathogen or
hazardous material.
[62]
An infectious disease is caused by organisms within the body [55]. A communicable
disease can be spread from person to person or from one species to another [56].
Infection is a risk for EMTs [57]. Infection risk can be minimized by immunizations,
protective techniques, and hand washing [58].
Routes of transmission include direct contact and indirect contact like a needle stick
[63]. Airborne transmission occurs through sneezing [63]. Foodborne transmission is
from contaminated food [63]. vector-borne transmission is via a flea or mosquito [63].
OSHA develops, publishes, and enforces guidelines for reducing workplace hazards
[64]. All EMTs are trained in handling blood-borne pathogens [65]. The CDC has
developed standard precautions for healthcare workers [66]. standard precautions
prevent contact with objects, blood, body fluids, and other potential risks [67].
Assume every person is potentially infected [68]. Apply infection control procedures
to reduce infection [68]. OSHA refers to this as universal precautions [69]. Notify your
designated officer if you are exposed [70].
donning and doffing full PPE in a consistent sequence is essential [71]. Common
components of PPE include a mask, eyewear, face shield, gloves, and a gown [72].
Proper hand washing is the simplest and most effective way to control disease
transmission [73]. Wash hands before and after patient contact, even if you wear
gloves [74]. Wear gloves if there is any possibility of exposure to blood or body fluids
[75]. Vinyl, nitrile, and latex gloves are effective [76]. Wear heavy-duty gloves when
cleaning the ambulance [77]. Change gloves between patients [77]. Removing gloves
requires a technique to avoid self-contamination [78].
Eye protection prevents blood splatters [79]. Prescription glasses are not adequate
[79]. Goggles or a face shield are best [79]. Gowns provide protection for extensive
blood splatter [80]. They may be worn during aerosolized generating procedures or
major trauma [80]. Wear a standard surgical mask for fluid splatter [81]. Place a surgical
mask on a patient [81]. Wear a particulate air respirator like an N95 if an airborne
disease is suspected [81]. Protective eyewear using safety glasses with side shields,
goggles, or a face shield is also needed [81]. If a patient needs oxygen, use a nonrebreathing
mask instead of a surgical mask [82]. Particulate air respirators must
comply with OSHA guidelines and be fit tested [83].
Mouth-to-mouth or mouth-to-mask resuscitation is recommended during active
community spread of an airborne virus [85]. Bag-valve ventilation is an aerosolgenerating
procedure and should be avoided in epidemic scenarios like COVID-19 [86]
. Proper use and disposal of sharps help avoid exposure to HIV and hepatitis [87]. Do
not recap, break, or bend needles [88]. Dispose of used sharps in an approved,
closed, and rigid container [89].
6. Employer Responsibilities and Immunity
The risk of being exposed to a communicable disease is a job hazard [90]. You should
follow OSHA and other national guidelines to reduce exposure risk [91]. Know and
follow your department's infection control plan [92]. Cleaning and decontaminating
the ambulance and equipment is important [93]. Clean the ambulance after each use
and daily whenever possible [94]. Cleaning should ideally be done at the hospital [95].
Remove medical waste and place it in a red biohazard bag [97]. Dispose of it at the
hospital [97]. Contaminated equipment left at the hospital should be cleaned by staff
or bagged for transport [98]. Use a bleach water solution at a 1 to 10 dilution to clean
the unit [99]. Remove contaminated linen and place it in the appropriate bag [100].
Reusable equipment should be cleaned and sterilized per department procedure [101].
Even if germs reach you, you are not necessarily at risk of infection [102]. Immunity is
a major factor in determining who gets sick [103]. You can be immune or resistant to
particular germs [104]. Immunity means having been immunized or vaccinated and
able to recover from an infection [105]. A history of childhood infectious diseases
should be recorded [106]. This includes chickenpox, mumps, measles, rubella, and
whooping cough [107]. The CDC recommends several immunizations for healthcare
workers [108]. Hepatitis B is required by OSHA [108]. Yearly influenza vaccination is
recommended [108]. MMR and varicella vaccines are also recommended [108]. The
Tdap shot is recommended every 10 years [108]. Skin tests for tuberculosis are
recommended prior to hire and annually [109].
For general post-exposure management, turn over patient care to another provider if
exposed to blood or body fluids [110]. Clean the exposed area with soap and water
[110]. If eyes were exposed, rinse them for 20 minutes [110]. Activate your department's
infection control plan [111]. Complete an exposure report [112]. Be screened to
determine significant exposure to a bloodborne pathogen [112]. You may be required
to quarantine if exposed to a highly communicable disease without proper PPE [112].
Post-exposure prophylactics and treatment are available for significant exposure [113].
7. Scene Safety Protocols
Hazard Protective Measures Source
Hazardous
Materials
Read labels/placards from a distance; Call a
hazardous material team; Do not care for patients
until moved and decontaminated; Remain upwind and
uphill; Keep distance; Contact dispatch for additional
response; Do not enter until instructed.
[117]
Electricity Mark off a danger zone around downed lines (one
span of power poles); Do not approach downed wires
or anything in contact with them; Avoid high ground
during lightning; Stay away from drainage ditches,
moist areas, small depressions, and wet ropes during
lightning; Become the smallest target possible; Drop
all equipment.
[126]
Fire Be aware of smoke, oxygen deficiency, high
temperatures, toxic gases, building collapse risk,
equipment, or explosions.
[135]
Vehicle
Crashes
Use sufficient proper protective gear; Be aware of
traffic, unstable vehicles, downed power lines,
violence risk, airbags, fluids, and sharp objects.
[136]
Personal safety is very important in an emergency situation [114]. Safety begins with
protecting yourself as soon as you are dispatched [114]. Wear your seatbelt and don
appropriate PPE [114]. Continue to protect yourself once on scene [115]. Make sure the
scene is well marked [115]. Place warning devices to alert other motorists [115]. Park at
a safe distance from the scene [115]. Ensure there are plenty of lights if it is dark [116].
Wear reflective clothing in dark scenes [116].
Upon arrival at a scene with potential hazardous materials, read labels, placards, and
identification numbers from a distance [117]. A specially trained hazardous material
team will handle disposal or patient removal [118]. Do not begin caring for patients
until they are moved and decontaminated [119]. Do not enter the scene unless it is
safe to do so [120]. The U.S. Department of Transportation ERG lists common hazard
materials and procedures [122]. Smartphone and tablet apps are also available [123].
General guidelines for hazmat scenes include not entering the scene if there is
evidence of a hazmat [123]. Remain upwind and uphill from the scene [124]. Keep your
distance [124]. Quickly contact dispatch and request additional responses [124]. Do not
enter the scene until instructed by trained responders [125].
Dealing with downed power lines is beyond EMT training [127]. Mark off a danger zone
around the downed lines until poles are secured [128]. This safety zone is one span of
the power poles' distance [128]. Do not approach a downed wire or touch anything it
contacts [129]. Lightning is a threat from a direct hit or a ground current [130]. A repeat
lightning strike can occur in the same area [132]. Avoid high ground to minimize direct
lightning strike risk [132]. To avoid ground current injury, stay away from drainage
ditches, moist areas, and wet ropes [133]. Become the smallest target possible and
drop all equipment [134].
Common hazards at a fire include smoke, oxygen deficiency, and high temperatures
[135]. Toxic gases, building collapse, equipment, or explosions are also hazards [135].
Vehicle crashes are common events [136]. Hazards at vehicle crashes include traffic,
unstable vehicles, and downed power lines [136]. Risk of violence, airbags, and fluid
and sharp objects are also present [137]. Use sufficient proper protective gear to
reduce risk [137].
8. Managing Violence on Scenes
Violence on scenes includes assaults, hostile situations, riots, or disturbances [138]. A
scene assessment should begin while en route [138]. Once on scene, continue
assessment using observation and information from other responders [138]. Maintain
personal safety and the safety of your team [138]. Mass violence situations may
involve several agencies [139]. Know who is in command [139]. Remain vigilant for
potential violence at all times [139]. Allow law enforcement to secure the scene before
approaching scenes involving projectiles [139]. Find protection [139].
Two types of protection exist [140]. cover is the use of impenetrable barriers for
protection [140]. concealment is hiding behind objects to limit visibility [141]. If the
event is a crime scene, attempt to maintain the chain of evidence [142]. Do not disturb
the scene unless absolutely necessary for patient treatment [143]. The rate of
violence-related injuries for emergency responders is 22 times higher than for other
employees [143]. Recommendations for preventing violence include training in
identifying potential violence scenes [144]. Training in de-escalation strategies and
techniques is recommended [144]. Practice ongoing scene assessments [144].
Dispatch identification and alerting of past or potential threats is important [144].
Recommendations for protection against violence include training in self-defense and
escape techniques [145]. Training in physical and chemical restraint techniques is also
recommended [145]. Fitting and use of body armor is advised [145]. Training and
practice in operations with law enforcement is crucial [145].

minimum 15 SPF.
[162]
Body Armor
(Bulletproof Vests)
Ranges from lightweight to heavy; May not be
practical for everyday use; Costly; Do not

[164]
Wearing protective clothing and other appropriate gear is critical to personal safety
[146]. Become familiar with the protective equipment available to you [147]. Inspect
your clothing and wear your gear regularly, ideally before reaching the scene [148].
Many EMS services have restricted policies regarding hair, rings, and jewelry [166]. Tie
hair up neatly [167]. Limit the number of rings worn [167]. Wear only a watch on your
wrist [168].
10. Caring for Critically Ill and Injured Patients
A patient needs to know who you are and what you are doing [168]. Let the patient
know you are attending to their immediate needs [169]. Avoid making unprofessional
comments during resuscitation [169]. Treat all patients with dignity and respect [169].
Techniques for communicating with critical patients include avoiding sad and grim
comments [170]. Such remarks may increase the patient's anxiety [170]. Orient the
patient to their surroundings using brief statements [170]. Be honest, deciding how
much information the patient can understand [170]. Allow the patient to be part of the
care being given [171]. Allow for hope if there is a slight chance [171]. Locate and notify
family members [171]. Assure the patient that you will take care of notifying
appropriate people [171].
Critically injured children should be cared for as any adult [172]. It is important that a
relative or responsible adult accompany the child [173]. This helps relieve anxiety and
assists in care [173].
11. Coping with Death and Dying
The death of a child is a tragic and dreaded event [175]. Help the family through the
initial period of death [176]. Acknowledge death in a private place [177]. Shock, denial,
and disbelief are common emotions [178]. If circumstances allow, let the parents hold
the child [179]. Use your best judgment to determine if this is appropriate [180]. Let the
family's actions be your guide [181]. The family may want to see the child, and you
should allow them to do so [182]. Prepare the parents for what they will see [183]. Do
not overload the grieving parents with information [184].
Death is likely to be either sudden or after a prolonged terminal illness [186]. The EMT
will sometimes face death [187]. The grieving process has stages [188]. The first stages
include denial, anger, hostility, bargaining, depression, or acceptance [189]. What can
the EMT do? You can ask the patient and family if there is anything you can do to
help [190]. Reinforce the reality of the situation [190]. Be honest with death and dying
[191]. Do not say you know how the patient or family feels [192]. Let the patient or
family members grieve in their own way [193].
12. Stress Management for EMTs
Physiological Manifestations of Stress
Increased respirations and Heart rate [198]
Increased blood vessels dilated [198]
Vessels near the skin surface dilated [198]
Pupils tense [198]
Muscles increase blood glucose levels [198]
Perspiration [198]
Decreases blood flow to the gastrointestinal tract [199]
EMS is a high-stress job [195]. It is important to know the causes of stress and ways
to deal with them [196]. Stressors include emotional, physical, and environmental
situations [196]. There are general adaptation syndromes [197]. The alarm response
occurs first [197]. Then there is reaction and resistance to stress [197]. Finally, there is
recovery or exhaustion [197].
Situations stressful for EMS providers include dangerous situations [200]. Physical or
psychological demands are also stressors [200]. Critically ill or injured patients are
stressful [200]. Dead or dying patients can be overpowering [200]. Sight, smells, and
sounds can cause stress [200]. Multiple patient situations are stressful [200]. Angry or
upset patients, families, or bystanders contribute to stress [200]. The unpredictability
and demands of EMS cause stressful situations [200].
There are different stress reactions [201]. An acute reaction can occur during the
event [201]. A delayed reaction manifests after the stressful event [202]. Cumulative
stress is prolonged or excessive stress [202]. Physical symptoms of stress include
fatigue and changes in appetite [202]. GI problems, headaches, and insomnia are also
symptoms [202]. Irritability and inability to concentrate can occur [202]. Hyperactivity
or underactivity can be physical symptoms [202]. Physiological symptoms include fear
and depression [203]. Guilt, oversensitivity, anger, and frustration are also symptoms
[203].
13. Critical Incident Stress and Burnout
Critical incident stress is brought about by acute, severe stressors [204]. These can
include mass casualty incidents [205]. Serious injury or traumatic death of a child can
cause this stress [205]. Crashes with injuries caused by an emergency provider are
also critical incidents [205]. Death or serious injury of a co-worker in the line of duty is
a severe stressor [205]. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may develop after a
distressing event [206]. It is characterized by re-experiencing the event [206]. Overresponding
to stimuli recalled from the event is also a characteristic [206].
Critical Incident Stress Management (CISM) helps providers relieve stress [207]. This
can occur formally or at an ongoing scene [207]. Trained CISM professionals facilitate
diffusing sessions [208]. Diffusing sessions are held during or immediately after the
event [208]. Debriefing sessions are held 24 to 72 hours after the event [208]. An
important rule is not to turn the debriefing into an operational critique [209]. If CISM is
not an option, private counseling by a mental health professional may be preferred
[210].
Burnout describes a combination of exhaustion, cynicism, and poor performance [211].
It results from long-term job stress [211]. Burnout affects the well-being of the EMT
and their colleagues and patients [212]. It can result in increased major medical errors
[212]. Increased rates of healthcare-associated infection can occur [212]. Increased
patient mortality is also a possible effect [212]. It contributes to decreases in work
morale and overall work effort [213]. Effective teamwork and patient satisfaction can
decrease [213]. Burnout can lead to an increase in job turnover [213].
Compassion fatigue is common among healthcare providers [214]. It is also known as
secondary stress disorder [214]. It is characterized by a gradual lessening of
compassion over time [214]. Symptoms include high absenteeism and difficult
relationships with colleagues [215]. Inability to work in teams and aggressive behavior
towards patients are symptoms [215]. Strong negative attitudes towards work and
lack of empathy for patients can occur [215]. A judgmental attitude towards patients
and preoccupation with non-work issues are also symptoms [215]. Other symptoms of
increased stress are present [215].
The suicide rate among emergency responders is higher than the rest of the
population [216]. Job stress is widely considered the largest contributing factor to
suicide [217]. Several organizations and mental health services are available to provide
emotional support [218].
14. Emotional Aspects of Emergency Care and Workplace Issues
Even experienced healthcare providers sometimes have difficulty overcoming
personal reactions [218]. The struggle to remain calm in horrible circumstances
contributes to emotional stress [219]. In stressful situations, exercise extreme
professional care in both words and actions [219]. Factors influencing a patient's
reaction to stress include socioeconomic background and fear of medical personnel
[219]. Alcohol or substance abuse disorders and a history of chronic stress also play a
role [219]. Mental disorders, reaction to medication, age, and nutritional status are
factors [219]. Feelings of guilt and past experiences with illness or injury also influence
reactions [219]. Quickly and calmly assess the actions of the patient, family, and
bystanders [220]. Use a professional tone, courtesy, sincere concern, and efficient
action [221]. Patients must have the opportunity to express their fears and concerns
[222]. Religious customs or needs of the patient must be respected [223]. Some people
have religious convictions opposing medication, blood, and blood products [223].
Report this information to the next level of care [224]. In the event of death, handle the
body with respect and dignity [225].
Workplace issues include cultural diversity on the job [226]. You are expected to work
alongside co-workers with varying backgrounds, attitudes, beliefs, and values [226].
Accept their differences [226]. Culture is not restricted to different nationalities [227].
Consider age, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, work experience, and education
[227]. Communicate in a way sensitive to everyone's needs [228]. Cultural humility
should be your ultimate goal [228]. Remain curious about others and reflect on their
viewpoints with an open mind [228].
Two types of sexual harassment exist [229]. Quid pro quo is when a harasser requests
sexual favors for something else, like a promotion [229]. Hostile working environment
can involve jokes, touching, requesting a date, or talking about body parts [230]. The
harasser's intent does not matter; the perception and impact of the behavior do [231].
Since EMTs depend on each other for safety, developing non-adversarial
relationships is especially important [231]. Report harassment to your supervisor
immediately [232].
Substance abuse is another workplace issue [233]. It increases the risk of accidents
and tension [233]. It causes poor treatment decisions [234]. Many EMS systems require
periodic random drug tests [235]. They also have for-cause testing when individuals
are believed to be under the influence [235]. Addicts and alcoholics develop great
skills at covering their behavior [236]. Seek help or confront an addicted coworker [237]
. Allowing substance abuse presents a tremendous hazard to the public [237].
Employee assistance programs (EAPs) are often available [238].
Injury and illness prevention is important [239]. EMS providers visit emergency
departments for work-related injuries over 20,000 times each year [239]. Each
program should include interrelated elements [240]. These elements include
management leadership and worker prevention [240]. Hazard identification and
assessment are crucial [240]. Hazard prevention and control are necessary [240].
Education and training are important [240]. Program evaluation and improvement are
also included [241].
15. Review of Key Concepts
A disease that can spread from person to person or species to species is known as a
communicable disease [242]. The most effective way of preventing disease spread is
hand washing [243]. When an EMT has blood splash into their eyes, it is an example of
an exposure [244]. Protective measures preventing healthcare workers from
contacting germs are called standard precautions [246].
In the general adaptation syndrome, the second stage of stress response is reaction
and resistance [247]. A condition characterized by re-experiencing an event and overresponding
to recalled stimuli is post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) [247].
Nutritious food is the fuel that makes the body run [249]. Physical exertion and stress
require high energy output [249]. The stage of grieving commonly resulting in blame is
anger and hostility [250]. Placards are used on buildings and transport vehicles [251].
The five most common hazards associated with a structural fire are smoke, oxygen
deficiency, high temperatures, toxic gases, and building collapse risk [252].
