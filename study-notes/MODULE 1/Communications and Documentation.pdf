1. Introduction to Communications and Documentation in EMS
Communication is sending information from one person to another [4]. This
can be verbal or through body language, which is non-verbal [4].
Effective communication is a key part of pre-hospital care [5].
It helps build a good relationship with patients and co-workers [6].
Verbal skills let you gather information from patients and bystanders [8].
Communication helps coordinate with other responders at a scene [8]. It is
also vital for transferring patient care to hospital staff [8].
Documentation is the written or electronic record of patient care [9].
It proves that appropriate care was given [10]. It also shares the patient's story
with those providing future care [10].
Good reporting and records ensure care continues smoothly [11]. They also
ensure proper transfer of responsibility [11].
Records help comply with health department and law enforcement rules [11].
They meet administrative needs of your organization [11].
Documentation also helps fund EMS research [12].
Communication systems like computers, radio, and telephone connect EMTs
to other services [12]. You must know how to use these systems effectively [13]
.
2. Therapeutic Communication and Special Populations
therapeutic communication uses verbal and non-verbal methods [15]. It
encourages patients to share their feelings [15]. It builds a positive relationship
with each patient [15].
The Shannon Weaver communication model helps understand
communication [16]. It has five parts: sender, thought, message, receiver, and
feedback [18]. The sender encodes a thought into a message and sends it to
the receiver [18]. The receiver decodes the message and sends feedback [19].
Several factors and strategies affect communication [20]. These include age,
culture, body language, eye contact, and voice tempo [20].
ethnocentrism is thinking your culture is better than others [27]. People with
this view interpret messages through their own perspective [28].
cultural imposition is forcing your views on others [28]. Healthcare providers
might do this, thinking their views are superior [28].

[25]
Environment Can affect communication (e.g., noise)
[20]
When communicating with older patients, identify yourself and be competent
[76]. Do not assume they are confused [76]. Assess for medical reasons behind
confusion [77]. Approach slowly and allow time for responses [78]. Be patient
and watch for confusion or sensory issues [78]. Locate personal items like
hearing aids or glasses [82]. Share concerns about their home or pets with
hospital staff [83].
When communicating with children, understand their fear [84]. Allow them to
keep a favorite toy [84]. Have a family member nearby if possible [84]. Be
honest about procedures [85]. Respect their modesty [86]. Use an appropriate
tone and vocabulary [87]. Position yourself at their level [88].
When communicating with hearing impaired patients, position yourself so
they can see your lips [90]. Be careful not to lose hearing aids [90]. Have paper
and a pen available [91]. Speak slowly and distinctly, never shouting [91]. Listen
carefully and give short answers [91]. Learning simple sign language phrases
like sick, hurt, and help can be useful [92].
When communicating with visually impaired patients, ask if they can see at
all [94]. Explain everything you are doing [96]. Stay in physical contact [97].
Transport mobility aids like a cane [98]. If possible, transport guide dogs with
the patient [99]. Arrange care for the dog if it cannot be transported [100].
When communicating with non-English speaking patients, you must still get
a medical history [102]. Use short, simple questions [102]. Point to body parts
[103]. Use a family member or friend to interpret until a professional is available
[103]. Consider learning common phrases in other languages [104]. Pocket
cards or translation apps can help [105]. Remember to ask for a translator at
the hospital [106].
3. Nonverbal and Verbal Communication Techniques
Nonverbal communication, or body language, provides more information
than words alone [29].
Facial expressions, body language, and eye contact are important [29].
Pay attention to your own body language, especially with hostile patients [33].
Stay calm to diffuse the situation [34]. Assess the scene for safety [35]. Avoid
an aggressive posture [36]. Make good eye contact but do not stare [37].
Speak calmly and confidently [38]. Never threaten the patient verbally or
physically [38].
Physical factors like noise can obscure a message's meaning [40]. Cultural
norms dictate the space between people when communicating [41].
Your gestures, body movements, and attitude are key to building trust [42].
Verbal communication involves asking questions [45].
open-ended questions require detailed answers [45]. Use them whenever
possible [45]. An example is, "What seems to be bothering you?" [46].
Closed-ended questions have short answers like yes or no [46]. Use these if
the patient cannot give long answers [47]. An example is, "Are you having
trouble breathing?" [47].
Several tools can help obtain information [49]. facilitation encourages patients
to talk more [49]. A pause gives them time to think and respond [50]. reflection
is restating their words to confirm understanding [51]. empathy is being
sensitive to their feelings [53]. clarification asks them to explain what they
meant [54]. confrontation makes a patient in denial focus on urgent issues [55]
. interpretation restates the complaint to confirm understanding [56].
Explanation provides factual information [57]. A summary provides an
overview of the conversation and next steps [58].
Touch can show care and compassion [58]. Use it consciously and sparingly
[59]. Approach slowly and touch the shoulder or arm respectfully [59]. Avoid
touching intimate areas for communication purposes [60].
Interview techniques to avoid include giving false assurance or unsolicited
advice [60]. Do not ask leading or biased questions [61]. Avoid talking too much
or interrupting [61]. Do not use "why" questions, authoritative language, or
jargon [61].
Family, friends, and bystanders can be helpful [62]. Allow the patient to
answer if possible [62]. Do not be afraid to ask others to step aside [63]. Decide
if their presence helps or hinders care [64].
Golden rules help calm and reassure patients [64]. Make eye contact and
keep it [64]. Provide your name and use the patient's proper name [64]. Tell the
truth [64]. Use language they understand [64]. Be careful what you say about
the patient [64]. Be aware of your body language [64]. Speak slowly and clearly
[64]. If the patient is hard of hearing, face them [64]. Allow time for answers [64]
. Act and speak calmly and confidently [64].
4. Emotional Intelligence in EMS
emotional intelligence involves people skills [65]. It is the ability to
understand and manage your own emotions [65]. It also means properly
responding to the emotions of others [65].
It helps diffuse conflicts and build rapport [66]. It leads to more effective
communication [66]. It helps manage difficult situations [66].
Attributes of emotional intelligence include self-awareness, recognizing your
emotions and their effect [67]. Self-regulation is controlling impulsive
emotions and behaviors [67]. Motivation is motivating yourself and others
positively [68]. empathy is understanding others' concerns and needs [69].
Social skills are developing positive relationships through effective
communication [70].
To improve emotional intelligence, assess how you react to stress [71]. Work
on staying calm with minor irritations [71]. Practice mindfulness [72]. Focus on
the present moment without blame [72]. Take responsibility for your actions
[72]. Consider how your actions affect others [72].
The behavioral change stairway model helps manage crisis situations [73].
Steps include active listening, displaying empathy, building rapport, and
exerting influence [75].
5. Mission Critical Communications and Patient Handover
Mission critical communications are those where disruption causes task
failure [107].
A shared mental model is important for teams to work effectively [109]. It is
the shared understanding of what is happening [109].
Building this model requires answering four questions [111]. What is the
patient's main priority? What is the history of prior care? What is the patient's
current state? What are the patient's immediate needs? [111]. Answering these
questions quickly helps avoid errors [111].
Effective patient care handover is crucial for good patient care [112].
Handover is the transfer of patient information and responsibility [113].
Communication failures during handover are a source of medical liability [114].
When giving a handover report, initiate eye contact [115]. Manage the
environment to reduce distractions [115]. Ensure ABCs (airway, breathing,
circulation) if priority care is needed [116]. Provide a structured report [117].
Acronyms like SBAR (Situation, Background, Assessment, Recap of
Treatment) or SBA2T (Situation, Background, Assessment, Treatment) can be
used [117].
The verbal report should include the patient's priority condition, prior care,
current state, and immediate needs [118].
When receiving a handover report, maintain eye contact [119]. Manage the
environment [119]. Ensure understanding [119]. Summarize the report [119].
Gather supplementary patient documentation [119].
6. Written Communications and Documentation: The Patient Care
Report (PCR)
The patient care report (pcr), also known as the pre-hospital care report, is a
legal document [121]. It records all aspects of patient care from dispatch to the
hospital [122].
PCRs can be written or electronic [123].
The PCR serves six functions [124].
Function of the PCR Description
Examples of information collected on the PCR include chief complaint and
mechanism of injury [127]. It also includes the level of consciousness, vital
signs, and ongoing assessment [127]. Patient demographics, transport
information, and destination choice are documented [127].
Administrative information includes incident times, such as dispatch, arrival on
scene, and arrival at the facility [129]. It also notes when patient care was
transferred and the unit was back in service [129].
Electronic PCRs (ePCRs) comply with nemsis data requirements [131]. They
can transmit information directly to hospital computers [131].
The narrative section of the PCR is very important [132]. Two common
narrative formats are CHART and SOAP [132].
The CHART method stands for Chief complaint, History, Assessment,
Treatment, and Transport [133]. It starts with dispatcher information and the
chief complaint [135]. History includes details of the current event and medical
history [137]. Assessment describes all assessments, including vital signs [140].
Treatment details all interventions performed [141]. Transport explains how the
patient was moved, positioned, and taken to the hospital [142].
The SOAP method stands for Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan
[143]. Subjective includes information from the patient or others [145]. Objective
details are gathered from your assessment, vital signs, and physical findings
[146]. Assessment summarizes key findings and provides your impression of
the problem [147]. Plan documents the treatment provided [148].
Regardless of the method, the narrative should include times of events and
assessment findings [148]. It should also detail emergency care provided and
changes in the patient [148]. Observations at the scene and final patient
disposition are included [148]. Refusal of care and the name of the person
taking over care must be documented [148]. Avoid radio codes and
abbreviations [148].
All PCRs are confidential documents [149]. Once complete, distribute copies
to appropriate locations [149].
7. Health Information Exchanges (HIEs) and Reporting Errors
Health Information Exchanges (HIEs), abbreviated as HIE, improve data
sharing [150]. They allow EMS to share data with other healthcare providers
[151].
HIEs let EMS providers access relevant patient data [152]. They help avoid
duplicating data entry [152]. They allow viewing patient outcomes related to
hospital care [152].
EMTs can contribute to and access electronic health information through HIEs
[153].
Most HIEs follow the SAFER framework [154]. SAFER stands for Search, Alert,
File, and Reconcile [154].
Search means EMS can search for hospital records [155]. This helps with
treatment and transport decisions [155]. Alert means hospitals are notified of
incoming patients [156]. Information from the EMS ePCR populates hospital
dashboards [156]. File means data from the EMS ePCR is put into the patient's
health record [157]. Reconcile provides feedback to EMS agencies on patient
outcomes [157]. This data is used for billing and quality improvement [158].
It is important to report errors accurately [159]. Do not try to cover up
omissions or inaccuracies [159]. This is falsification and can lead to poor care,
suspension, or legal action [159].
The proper way to correct a mistake on a handwritten report is to draw a
single horizontal line through the error [160]. Initial it and write the correct
information next to it [161].
If an error is found after submitting, follow the same process [162]. Add a note
with the correct information [162].
If information was omitted, begin a new section with the word "addendum"
[163]. Add the new information and your dated initials [164].
Never use correction fluid or erase errors [165].
8. Documenting Refusal of Care and Special Reporting Situations
Documenting refusal of care is very important [166]. It is a common source of
lawsuits [166].
Thorough documentation is crucial [166].
Include all assessment findings and emergency care given [167]. Have the
patient sign a refusal of care form [167]. Have a witness like a family member or
police officer also sign [167].
Documentation should include evidence the patient made a rational,
informed decision [167]. Detail discussions about recommended care and
potential consequences of refusal [167]. Include discussions with family or
bystanders who tried to encourage care [167]. Note discussion with medical
direction if required by protocol [167].
Also document providing the patient with alternatives [168]. Examples include
seeing their family doctor or having someone drive them to the hospital [168].
Document the willingness of EMS to return [168]. Obtain signatures and
complete the PCR [168].
Special reporting situations depend on local requirements [169]. Examples
include gunshot wounds and dog bites [169]. Certain infectious diseases,
suspected abuse (physical or sexual), and mass casualty incidents (MCIs) are
also special situations [169].
9. Communication Systems and Equipment
Radio and telephone communications connect EMS teams with other
services [170]. This includes fire and law enforcement [170]. They help the entire
team work together and provide safety [171].
A base station radio contains the transmitter and receiver [172]. It is usually in
a fixed location [172]. A channel is an assigned frequency for communications
[173]. A dedicated line, or hotline, is for specific point-to-point contact [174].
A mobile radio is installed in a vehicle like an ambulance [176]. Ambulances
often have more than one [177].
Portable radios are handheld [178]. They are essential at MCI scenes or when
away from the ambulance [178]. They help communicate with dispatch, other
units, or medical control [179].
Repeater-based systems use a special base station radio called a repeater
[180]. The repeater receives signals on one frequency and transmits them on
another [181]. This allows units that cannot reach each other directly to
communicate [181].
Digital equipment is used in the field [185]. Telemetry converts electronic
signals into coded audible signals [186]. These can be sent by radio or phone
to a hospital receiver [187]. It is used for data from cardiac monitors [187].
Cellular and satellite telephones are also used [189]. EMTs often use cellular
phones to talk to hospitals [189]. Satellite phones are another option [189].
A scanner searches across several frequencies [190]. It stops when it receives
a broadcast [190]. Conversations can be easily overheard [191].
Ambulances usually have an external public address system [192].
Two-way radio hardware includes simplex, duplex, and multiplex [193].
Simplex is push-to-talk, release-to-listen [194]. Duplex allows simultaneous
talk and listen [195]. Multiplex uses multiple frequencies for simultaneous
transmissions [195].
MED channels are reserved for EMS use [196]. Trunking systems assign many
frequencies and use a computer to find an open one [197].
Mobile data terminals (MDTs) are computers in the ambulance [198]. They
receive data from dispatch and provide expanded capabilities [199]. For
example, they can show a map to the dispatched address [200].
10. Regulations and Protocols Governing Radio Communications
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulates all radio
operations in the US [202].
The FCC has five main EMS-related responsibilities [202].
They allocate specific radio frequencies for EMS use [203].
They license base stations and assign call signs [204].
They establish license standards and specifications for EMS radio
equipment [205].
They set limitations for transmitter power outputs [206].
They monitor radio operations [206].
FCC rules regarding EMS communications are found in Part 90, Subpart B
[207].
11. Communication with Dispatch and Medical Control
The dispatcher receives the initial 911 call [209]. Their responsibility starts
with screening calls and assigning priority [210]. This is done according to
protocols [211].
They select and alert the correct EMS unit [212]. They direct the unit to the
location [213]. They coordinate EMS with other public safety services [213].
They also provide emergency medical instructions to the caller [214].
The dispatcher assigns units based on factors like the problem's severity and
response time [215]. The level of training and need for additional support are
also considered [215].
The dispatcher should give responding units information [216]. This includes
the nature and severity of the illness or injury [216]. The exact location and
number of patients are provided [217]. Response of other agencies and special
advisories (like traffic or weather) are given [219]. They also provide the time
the units were dispatched [219].
EMTs should report any problems during the run to dispatch [220]. They
should inform dispatch upon arrival at the scene [220]. The arrival report
should include obvious details from the scene size-up [220].
Radio communications must be brief and clear [221]. Use plain English and
avoid codes [221]. Report only important information [222].
The main reason for radio communication with medical control or hospitals
is to facilitate communication [223]. Medical control can be at the hospital or
another facility [224].
Consulting with medical control serves many purposes [225]. It notifies the
hospital of an incoming patient [225]. It allows requesting advice or receiving
orders [225]. It advises the hospital in special situations [225].
Plan and organize your radio communication before transmitting [226]. A
patient report to medical control commonly includes 10 elements [226]. These
include unit ID, service level, patient condition, and estimated time of arrival
[226]. Patient age, gender, chief complaint, and history are included [226].
Physical findings, care given, patient response, and any questions from the
facility are also part of the report [226].
The role of medical control is either offline (indirect) or online (direct) [227].
You may need to call medical control for direct orders [227]. This could be for
administering certain treatments or determining transport destination [227].
Permission might be needed to stop treatment or not transport [227].
In many areas, medical control is provided by hospital physicians [229].
However, variations exist, and it may come from a freestanding center [230].
When calling medical control, your report must be precise and contain only
important information [232]. Never use codes unless directed by local protocol
[233].
After receiving an order from medical control, repeat it back word for word
[234]. Receive confirmation [234]. Do not follow an order that does not make
sense [235].
12. Information Regarding Special Situations and Equipment
Maintenance
You may initiate communication with hospitals about extraordinary
situations [236].
Notifying a small rural hospital early about multiple patients from a crash helps
them respond [237]. An entire hospital system must be notified of any disaster
[237].
Other special situations to relay include hazardous material incidents or
rescues in progress [238]. Possible multiple casualty incidents (MCIs) should
also be communicated [238].
When identifying special situations to the hospital, several points are
important [239]. The earlier you notify them, the better [239]. Provide an
estimated number of patients needing transport [240]. Identify any special
needs patients might have, like burns or hazmat exposure [240]. This helps the
hospital prepare [241].
Maintenance of radio equipment is necessary [242]. Like other EMS
equipment, it must be serviced at the start of each shift [242]. Check your
radio equipment [243].
Radio equipment may fail during a run [244]. You must have and follow a
backup plan [244].
Standing orders are written documents signed by the medical director [245].
They outline specific directions and permissions [245]. When followed
properly, they have the same authority as orders given over the radio [246].
