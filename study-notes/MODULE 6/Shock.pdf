1. Definition and Mechanisms of Shock
Shock, also known as hypoperfusion, is defined as inadequate cellular
perfusion [4].
Any compromise in perfusion can lead to cellular injury or death [6].
In early stages, the body attempts to maintain homeostasis [6].
The cardiovascular system has three parts: the pump (heart), the container
(blood vessels), and the contents (blood) [13].
These three parts are also called the perfusion triangle [16].
If one or more parts of the perfusion triangle are not working properly, a
patient can go into shock [17].
Poor perfusion impairs the transportation of carbon dioxide out of tissues [11].
This results in a dangerous buildup of waste products [11].
This buildup can cause cellular damage [12].
Shock is a state of collapse and failure of the cardiovascular system leading to
inadequate circulation [12].
To protect vital organs, the body redirects blood flow from areas tolerant of
low flow, like the skin and intestines, to vital organs like the heart, brain, and
lungs [12].
Early recognition and treatment of shock signs and symptoms can save lives
[12].
Shock is life-threatening and requires immediate recognition and treatment
[12].

2. Causes and Types of Shock
There are three basic causes of shock [25].
These basic causes relate to the perfusion triangle failing [25].
The three basic causes are pump failure, poor blood vessel function, and
low fluid volume [26].
Different types of shock result from these basic problems [28].
Types of shock include cardiogenic and obstructive shock (pump failure) [29]
.
obstructive shock is further broken down into tension pneumothorax, cardiac
tamponade, and pulmonary emboli [29].
distributive shock is a type of poor vessel function [30].
Inside of distributive shock are septic, neurogenic, anaphylactic, and
psychogenic shock [30].
hypovolemic shock is a type of low fluid volume shock [31].
hypovolemic shock is broken down into hemorrhagic and non-hemorrhagic
[31].
Basic Cause Resulting Shock Types
Pump Failure Cardiogenic, Obstructive [29]
Poor Vessel
Function
Distributive (Septic, Neurogenic, Anaphylactic,
Psychogenic) [30]
Low Fluid Volume Hypovolemic (Hemorrhagic, Non-Hemorrhagic) [31]
3. Detailed Overview of Pump Failure Shock (Cardiogenic and
Obstructive)
cardiogenic shock is a pump failure problem [32].
It is caused by inadequate function of the heart [32].
A major effect is the backup of blood into pulmonary vessels [32].
This results in pulmonary edema [32].
cardiogenic shock is often caused by heart failure or a heart attack [32].
The heart cannot maintain output to meet the body's demands [33].
obstructive shock is also a pump failure problem [36].
The heart is unable to work due to a mechanical obstruction [36].
This prevents adequate flow of blood from the heart chambers [38].
Three types of obstructive shock are cardiac tamponade, tension
pneumothorax, and pulmonary emboli [38].
cardiac tamponade is a collection of fluid between the pericardial sac and
the myocardium [38].
This fluid prevents the heart from contracting effectively [39].
It can be caused by blunt or penetrating trauma causing hemorrhage
around the heart [41].
Signs and symptoms are called beck's triad [42].
beck's triad includes jugular vein distension, muffled heart tones, and
narrowing pulse pressures [43].
tension pneumothorax is caused by air damaging lung tissue [46].
Air escapes into the chest cavity and the lung collapses [46].
Untreated, air accumulates and puts pressure on organs including the
heart [48].
This pressure obstructs the heart's ability to beat [49].
pulmonary emboli are blood clots in the pulmonary circulation [51].
They block blood flow through the pulmonary vessels [53].
A massive pulmonary emboli can prevent blood from being pumped from
the right to the left side of the heart [53].
This leads to a backup of blood in the right ventricle [53].
This can cause catastrophic obstructive shock and complete pump failure
[53].
4. Detailed Overview of Poor Vessel Function Shock (Distributive)
distributive shock is caused by poor vessel function [55].
It results from widespread dilation of small arterioles, venules, or both [58].
Blood pools in the expanded vascular beds [58].
Tissue perfusion decreases [58].
There are different types of distributive shock [58].
These include septic, neurogenic, anaphylactic, and psychogenic shock
[59].
septic shock occurs from a severe infection, usually bacteria [60].
Toxins are generated by bacteria or infected tissues [61].
There is widespread vessel dilation and plasma loss through vessel walls
[61].
Decreased fluid results in shock [61].
neurogenic shock is usually from a spinal cord injury [62].
Blood vessel muscles are cut off from nerve impulses [63].
Vessels below the injury dilate widely [64].
This increases the size and capacity of the vascular system [64].
Blood pools, and the body loses the ability to constrict vessels [64].
anaphylactic shock happens when a person reacts violently to a substance
[66].
This occurs after being sensitized to the substance [68].
Sensitization means becoming sensitive to a substance that didn't initially
cause a reaction [68].
Each exposure tends to produce a more severe reaction [69].
psychogenic shock is a sudden reaction of the nervous system [71].
It causes temporary, generalized vascular dilation [71].
Usually, the patient has a syncopal episode (fainting) [71].
Life-threatening causes include irregular heartbeat or brain aneurysm [72].
Non-lethal events include bad news, fear, or unpleasant sights like blood
[72].
Type of Distributive
Shock
Cause / Characteristics
Septic Shock Severe infection (bacteria), toxins, widespread dilation
[60]
Neurogenic Shock Spinal cord injury, vessel dilation below injury [62]
Anaphylactic Shock Severe allergic reaction after sensitization [66]
Psychogenic Shock Sudden nervous system reaction, temporary dilation,
fainting [71]
5. Detailed Overview of Low Fluid Volume Shock (Hypovolemic)
hypovolemic shock is a fluid issue [73].
It is the result of an inadequate amount of fluid or volume in the circulatory
system [73].
This is a problem with the blood itself [73].
There are two types: hemorrhagic and non-hemorrhagic hypovolemic shock
[73].
hypovolemic shock can occur with conditions like thermal burns [74].
6. Stages and Recognition of Shock
There are different stages of shock [74].
These include compensated shock, decompensated shock, and
irreversible shock [74].
In compensated shock, the body can maintain perfusion [74].
Once shock has progressed too far, it becomes irreversible [74].
It is impossible to assess when a patient has reached the irreversible stage
[74].
Recognizing and treating shock very early is important [74].
Treatment is needed well before the patient becomes decompensated [74].
Blood pressure is the last measurable factor to change with shock [75].
When a drop in blood pressure is evident, shock is well developed [75].
This is especially true for infants and children [76].
Infants and children can maintain blood pressure until they lose more than
half their blood volume [76].
By the time their blood pressure drops, they are close to death [76].
Expect shock in many emergency medical situations [77].
Expect shock if a patient has conditions such as multiple fractures, abdominal
or chest injury, spinal injury, severe infection, a heart attack, or anaphylaxis
[77].
Stage of Shock Characteristics
Compensated Body is able to compensate, maintains perfusion [74]
Decompensated Body can no longer compensate effectively [74]
Irreversible Shock has progressed too far, no recovery possible [74]
7. Assessment and General Emergency Care for Shock
Begin with scene size-up to ensure safety [78].
Determine the mechanism of injury or nature of illness [78].
Perform a primary assessment [79].
If shock is suspected, do a rapid exam [79].
Determine the level of consciousness (LOC) [79].
Identify and treat any life-threatening concerns first [79].
Determine the priority of patient transport [80].
Control massive external hemorrhage; this is the first priority [80].
Use direct pressure first [123].
If direct pressure fails, use a tourniquet [81].
Assess and treat ABCs (Airway, Breathing, Circulation) after controlling lifethreatening
bleeding [82].
Ensure a patent airway [85].
Quickly assess breathing [86].
Assess circulatory status for clues of shock [86].
Check for distal and central pulses [87].
Determine if pulse is fast, slow, weak, strong, or absent [87].
A rapid pulse suggests compensated shock [88].
Assess skin color, temperature, and condition [90].
Check capillary refill [90].
If the patient has signs of hypoperfusion, treat aggressively [84].
Provide high-flow oxygen [83].
Initiate rapid transport [84].
Request advanced life support (ALS) as necessary for aggressive shock
management [84].
Consider spinal immobilization if needed [85].
Maintain inline stabilization if necessary [100].
Comfort, calm, and reassure the patient [101].
Maintain the patient in the supine position [101].
Do not allow patients to eat or drink [102].
Prevent body heat loss by using blankets [104].
Treat additional injuries en route [105].
Consider rendezvous with ALS or aero medical transport if needed [105].
Accurately record vital signs every five minutes throughout treatment and
transport [106].
After managing life threats, take a history, including the chief complaint and a
SAMPLE history [92].
Perform secondary assessments, including a physical exam [93].
Repeat the primary assessment and perform a focused assessment [94].
Assess the entire body if there is significant illness or injury, a poor general
impression, problems in the primary assessment, or an unresponsive medical
patient [94].
Perform assessments quickly but thoroughly [95].
If a life-threatening problem is found, treat it immediately [96].
Take vital signs [97].
Reassess the patient's vital signs, interventions, chief complaint, ABCs, and
mental status [97].
Determine needed interventions based on findings, focusing on supporting
the cardiovascular system [98].
Begin immediate treatment for shock as soon as it is recognized [99].
Follow local precautions [100].
Maintain body temperature by placing blankets under and over the patient
[104].
8. Specific Emergency Care for Different Types of Shock
For cardiogenic shock:
These patients often have chest pain and low blood pressure or a weak,
irregular pulse [107].
They may show cyanosis, anxiety, and nausea [108].
Do not give nitro if they are hypotensive [108].
Place them in a position that eases breathing [109].
Give high-flow O2 [109].
Initiate prompt transport and request ALS [109].
For obstructive shock:
For cardiac tamponade:
Prioritize increasing cardiac output [111].
Give high-flow oxygen [111].
Surgery is the only definitive treatment [111].
For tension pneumothorax:
Give high-flow O2 via a non-rebreather to prevent hypoxia [111].
Chest decompression is required but is an ALS skill [112].
Request ALS assistance early but do not delay transport waiting for
them [112].
For septic shock:
This requires hospital management, including antibiotics [113].
Use standard precautions [113].
Transport promptly [113].
Give high-flow O2 and possibly support ventilations with a BVM [114].
Preserve body heat [114].
Notify a specialized sepsis team if available [114].
Obtain and maintain a proper airway and assist breathing [115].
Ensure effective circulation [116].
Transport to a facility capable of managing neurogenic shock [117].
For anaphylactic shock:
Administer Epi intramuscularly (IM) as the most effective treatment [118].
Requires immediate transport [119].
Give high-flow O2 and possibly assistance with a BVM [119].
Find out the cause of the reaction and how it was received [119].
Be aware that a mild reaction can worsen suddenly [119].
Due to potential airway compromise, request ALS backup as soon as
possible [119].
For psychogenic shock:
In uncomplicated fainting, circulation to the brain is restored when the
patient becomes supine [120].
psychogenic shock can worsen other types of shock [121].
If a patient fell from psychogenic shock, check for injuries, especially in
older patients [121].
If a patient cannot walk after falling, suspect another problem like a head
or hip injury [122].
Transport promptly; all patients with loss of consciousness need
evaluation at the emergency department [122].
For hypovolemic shock:
Stop obvious external bleeding first [123].
Direct pressure is the best initial method [123].
If direct pressure doesn't work, use a tourniquet [123].
Handle the patient gently and keep them warm [123].
Recognize internal bleeding and provide aggressive general support [123].
Secure and maintain an airway and provide respiratory support, including
oxygen and ventilations [123].
Transport rapidly to the emergency department [124].

airway, respiratory support, keep warm, rapid transport [123]
9. Considerations for Pediatric and Geriatric Patients in Shock
Treating shock in older patients is no different than treating any other shock
patient [125].
Older patients generally have more serious complications than younger
patients [125].
Many older patients take numerous medications [125].
These medications can mask or mimic signs of shock [125].
Blood pressure changes are a late indicator of shock, particularly in infants
and children [76].
Infants and children can maintain their pressure until they lose more than half
their blood volume [76].
By the time pressure drops in infants and children, they are close to death [76].
Provide inline spinal stabilization if indicated [126].
If spinal stabilization is not indicated, maintain the patient in a position of
comfort [126].
Control life-threatening hemorrhages immediately with direct pressure [126].
Suction as necessary [126].
Provide high-flow oxygen via a non-rebreather mask [126].
Maintain body temperature [127].
Provide rapid transport for all patients in shock, including older and younger
patients [127].
