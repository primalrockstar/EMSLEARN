1. Introduction to Basic Life Support (BLS)
Basic Life Support (BLS) is non-invasive emergency life-saving care used to treat
medical conditions like airway obstructions, respiratory arrest, and cardiac arrest [6].
The principles of BLS were introduced in 1960, and techniques have been regularly
reviewed and revised [4].
BLS focuses on the ABCs: Airway, Breathing, and Circulation [8].
For patients in cardiac arrest, the CAB sequence (Compressions, Airway,
Breathing) is used because chest compressions are essential and must start
quickly [9].
Only seconds should pass between recognizing the need for treatment and
starting bls [9].
Time is critical for patients who are not breathing; permanent brain damage is
possible if the brain is without oxygen for more than four to six minutes [10].
BLS differs from Advanced Life Support (ALS), which includes advanced
procedures like cardiac monitoring and administering medications [19].
When done correctly, BLS can maintain life temporarily until ALS measures can
begin [20].
The American Heart Association Chain of Survival includes six links that must all be
followed [21].
These links are recognition and activation of the emergency response system,
immediate high-quality CPR, rapid defibrillation, basic and advanced emergency
services, advanced life support, post-arrest care, and recovery [23].
If any link is missing, the patient is more likely to die [25].

2. Core Components of BLS: CPR and Defibrillation
Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) re-establishes circulation and artificial
ventilation in a patient who is not breathing and has no pulse [14].
The steps of CPR involve restoring circulation through high-quality chest
compressions and restoring breathing by opening the airway and providing rescue
breathing [15].
Administer two breaths over one second, visualizing for chest rise and fall [17].
Chest compressions involve applying rhythmic pressure and relaxation to the lower
half of the sternum [49].
Compression squeezes the heart to circulate blood [49].
Avoid leaning on the chest between compressions to allow for complete recoil
[49].
Injuries can be minimized with proper technique and hand placement [50].
Compression and relaxation should be rhythmic and of equal duration, a one-toone
ratio [53].
The sternum must return to its normal resting position between compressions
[54].
An automated external defibrillator (AED) is a vital link in the chain of survival and
should be applied to a cardiac arrest patient as soon as possible [34].
If cardiac arrest is witnessed, begin CPR and then apply the AED immediately
[36].
aed use in children differs: apply after the first five cycles of CPR (about two
minutes) [37].
Use pediatric-sized pads and a dose attenuating system [38].
If pediatric pads or attenuator are unavailable, use adult-sized pads with an
anterior-posterior placement [39].
For patients with pacemakers or implanted defibrillators, place AED electrodes at
least one inch away from the device [40].
If the patient is wet or in water, pull them out and dry the skin before attaching AED
pads [41].
If in a small puddle or snow, the aed can be used, but the chest should be dried
[42].
Remove transdermal medication patches and wipe the skin before attaching AED
pads [42].
For CPR to be effective, the patient must be supine on a firm, flat surface [43].
Ensure enough space for two rescuers [44].
If possible, log roll the patient onto a long backboard [45].
Quickly check for breathing and a pulse simultaneously, taking no longer than 10
seconds [46].
Visualize the chest for signs of breathing and palpate for a carotid pulse [48].
One-rescuer adult CPR involves a continuous cycle of 30 compressions followed by
two ventilations [67].
Two-rescuer adult CPR is preferred [69].
Rescuers can switch positions every two minutes to facilitate effective
compressions [70].
Basic principles of bls are the same for infants, children, and adults, but the causes
of arrest differ [30].
Cardiac arrest in adults usually follows respiratory arrest, while in infants and
children, respiratory arrest typically causes cardiac arrest [31].
Airway and breathing are the focus of pediatric BLS [80].
For effective chest compressions, the infant or child must be on a hard, flat surface
[86].
Use two fingers to compress an infant's chest [86].
If two rescuers are present for an infant, use the two-thumb encircling technique
[86].
In children older than eight years old, the heel of one or both hands can be used
[87].
If a child is not breathing but has a pulse, open the airway and deliver one breath
every two to three seconds (about 12 to 20 breaths a minute) [91].
If a child is not breathing and has no pulse, provide rescue breathing after every 30
compressions, or 15 compressions if two rescuers are present [92].
Maintain a chest compression fraction greater than 80%, meaning compressions
should be performed for at least 80% of the total resuscitation time [100].

3. Airway Management in BLS
Opening the airway is the next step in BLS after starting cpr and applying an AED.
In non-traumatic adult patients, open the airway using a head tilt-chin lift maneuver
[57].
If trauma is suspected, use the jaw thrust maneuver [57].
Remove any foreign materials found in the mouth [57].
If the patient is breathing adequately and has no signs of head, spine, hip, or pelvis
injury, place them in the recovery position [58].
The recovery position maintains an open airway in an adequately breathing
patient with a decreased level of consciousness who has no spinal injury [58].
Lack of oxygen (hypoxia) combined with too much carbon dioxide (hypercarbia) is
lethal [59].
If the patient is not breathing, provide deliberate ventilations lasting for one second
[59].
Ventilations can be given by one or two EMS providers [60].
Use a barrier device such as a pocket mask with a one-way valve or a bag-valve
mask [61].
These devices are used to supply supplemental oxygen when possible [61].
Artificial ventilations may cause gastric distension (stomach filling with air), which
can lead to vomiting [64].
Be ready with a suction unit in case the patient vomits [64].
For patients with a stoma (a surgical opening connecting the trachea to the skin),
place the bag mask or pocket mask device directly over the stoma to ventilate [63].
A face mask with a one-way valve or barrier device over the tracheostomy site
can also be used [94].
In a child with a trach tube, remove the mask from the bag and connect it
directly to the tube [93].
4. Managing Foreign Body Airway Obstruction
Recognize foreign body airway obstructions, remembering the most common cause
in unresponsive patients is the relaxation of throat muscles, particularly the tongue
[109].
Other causes include vomited contents, blood, damaged tissue, dentures, food, or
small objects [110].
In adults, airway obstruction usually occurs during a meal, while in children, it can
happen during a meal or at play [111].
With a mild airway obstruction, the patient can exchange an adequate amount of air
but shows signs of respiratory distress [112].
Leave patients with mild obstruction alone and observe for signs of severe
obstruction, continuing to reassess [113].
A sudden severe obstruction is usually easy to recognize in responsive patients [115].
The patient suddenly cannot speak or cough, may grasp their throat, turn
cyanotic, and make exaggerated breathing efforts; stridor might also be present
[116].
In unresponsive patients, suspect airway obstruction if maneuvers to open the
airway and ventilate are ineffective [117].
To remove a foreign airway obstruction in adults and children older than one year,
use the abdominal thrust maneuver (Heimlich maneuver) [118].
This maneuver creates an artificial cough [119].
If a patient with a severe airway obstruction becomes unresponsive, perform chest
compressions [120].
Instead of abdominal thrusts, use chest thrusts for women in advanced stages of
pregnancy and obese patients [123].
If a responsive patient becomes unresponsive due to airway obstruction, lower
them to the ground, call for help, and start 30 chest compressions [127].
Do not check for a pulse before starting compressions [128].
Open the airway and look in the mouth; if a visible object can be easily removed,
remove it with a finger [129].
If no object is seen, continue chest compressions [130].
Repeat the sequence until the obstruction is relieved or als takes over [131].
In unresponsive patients, after checking for breathing and a pulse, if a pulse is
present but breathing is absent, open the airway and attempt to ventilate [132].
If the first ventilation doesn't cause chest rise, reposition the airway and attempt
again [134].
If both attempts fail, perform 30 compressions, open the airway, look for and
carefully remove any visible object, then attempt to ventilate again [135].
In children with signs of airway obstruction, do not waste time trying to dislodge the
object if they can still breathe, cough, or talk; administer supplemental oxygen if
needed and transport immediately [136].
If they can breathe, cough, or talk, do not interfere [138].
For a responsive, standing, or sitting child, perform the heimlich maneuver with less
force than on an adult [140].
An unresponsive child older than one year with airway obstruction is managed like
an adult [141].
For responsive infants, perform back slaps and chest thrusts (compressions) [143].
Hold the infant face down on your forearm with the head lower than the body
[144].
Give five back blows between the shoulder blades with the heel of your hand
[146].
Roll the infant over and give five quick chest thrusts with two fingers on the
lower half of the sternum [146].
In unresponsive infants, begin chest compressions immediately; do not check for a
pulse [148].
Open the airway and look in the mouth; if a visible object can be easily removed,
remove it [150].
If no object is seen, resume chest compressions [152].
Continue the sequence of compressions, opening the airway, and looking in the
mouth until the obstruction is relieved or als takes over [153].

5. Special Considerations and When to Stop BLS
There are special circumstances to consider during bls [154].
For opiate overdoses, EMTs may administer narcan to reverse the arrest [155].
In cardiac arrest during pregnancy, the priority is high-quality cpr [155].
If the uterus is felt at or above the umbilicus, perform manual displacement of
the uterus to the patient's left to relieve compression on the great vessels
while doing cpr [155].
If not in cardiac arrest, position the pregnant patient on her left side [155].
There are three general rules for when not to start cpr [102].
If the scene is unsafe [102].
If the patient has obvious signs of death along with absence of pulse and
breathing [102].
Obvious signs of death include rigor mortis (stiffening), dependent
lividity/liver mortis (purple discoloration), putrefaction (decomposition), or
evidence of a non-survivable injury [103].
If the patient and physician have previously agreed on Do Not Resuscitate (DNR)
orders [106].
Once cpr begins, continue until one of the following events occurs, using the STOP
mnemonic [106].
Mnemonic Meaning Explanation
S Patient starts breathing and has a
pulse [106]
Indicates a return of spontaneous
circulation.
T Patient is transferred to another
provider of equal or higher training
[107]
Handing over care to qualified
personnel.
O You are out of strength [107] Physically unable to continue CPR,
not just tired.
P Physician directs you to discontinue
[107]
Medical command provides an
order to stop resuscitation efforts.
6. Importance of Training and Support
Ongoing education and training are crucial for EMTs [164].
cpr skills can deteriorate over time [164].
Practice often using mannequin-based training [164].
cpr self-instruction through video or computer-based modules with hands-on
practice can be an alternative to instructor-led courses [165].
Education and training for the public are also very important [166].
EMTs are patient advocates responsible for facilitating training of lay people in
cpr and aed operation [166].
If asked to train community members in hands-only cpr, consider it a
professional responsibility [167].
Grief support for family members and loved ones is a significant aspect of care [156].
Family members may experience a psychological crisis [156].
They will remember the event in detail for the rest of their lives [157].
Appropriate and supportive care at the onset of grief can positively affect their
grieving process [157].
Keep the family informed throughout the resuscitation process [158].
Designate one provider to communicate the patient's status clearly and
concisely [158].
After resuscitation has stopped, helpful measures include taking the family to a
quiet, private place, introducing yourself, using clear language, and speaking in a
warm, sensitive, and caring manner [159].
Exhibit calm, reassuring authority, use the patient's name, and use eye contact
and appropriate touch [160].
Accept that family members will show emotion; be supportive but do not hover
[161].
Ask if a friend or family member can be called for support [162].
When leaving, turn the family member over to someone and ensure children are
not ignored [163].
