# Module 6: Shock & Resuscitation Techniques

---

## Chapter 13: Shock

### Overview
Defines shock, its types, causes, signs and symptoms, and EMS management strategies.

### Learning Objectives
- Recognize types of shock and their causes.
- Identify assessment findings in shock.
- Implement prehospital management of shock.

### Key Terms
| Term      | Definition |
|-----------|------------|
| Hypovolemic Shock | Shock due to blood/fluid loss. |
| Cardiogenic Shock | Shock due to heart failure. |
| Distributive Shock| Shock due to vessel dilation (e.g., septic, neurogenic, anaphylactic). |
| Compensated Shock | Early stage, body maintains BP. |

### Major Concepts & Guidelines
- Shock is inadequate tissue perfusion.
- Early recognition and rapid intervention are critical.
- Types: hypovolemic, cardiogenic, distributive, obstructive.

### Procedures / Protocols
- **Shock Management:**  
  - Control bleeding.
  - Administer oxygen.
  - Keep patient warm.
  - Rapid transport.

### Assessment & Clinical Pearls
- Watch for altered mental status and cool, clammy skin.
- BP may be normal in compensated shock.

### Documentation Standards
- Document findings, interventions, and patient response.

### Case Example
> Trauma patient with weak pulse and pale skin. What type of shock is likely?

### Quick Reference Table
| Type         | Cause             | Treatment         |
|--------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Hypovolemic  | Bleeding, dehydration| Fluid, stop bleeding |

### Review Questions
1. What are early signs of shock?
2. Name two types of distributive shock.
3. What is the priority in shock management?

## Chapter 14: BLS Resuscitation

### Overview
Covers Basic Life Support (BLS) principles, CPR, AED use, and airway management during resuscitation.

### Learning Objectives
- Perform high-quality CPR and use AED.
- Recognize cardiac arrest and initiate resuscitation.
- Understand airway and ventilation strategies in BLS.

### Key Terms
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| CPR  | Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation. |
| AED  | Automated External Defibrillator. |
| ROSC | Return of Spontaneous Circulation. |

### Major Concepts & Guidelines
- Early CPR and defibrillation saves lives.
- High-quality chest compressions: 2 inches deep, rate 100â€“120/min, full recoil.
- Minimal interruptions, switch providers every 2 min.

### Procedures / Protocols
- **CPR:**  
  - Check responsiveness, call for help, start compressions.
- **AED:**  
  - Attach pads, follow prompts, resume CPR after shock.

### Assessment & Clinical Pearls
- Avoid over-ventilation.
- Defibrillate as soon as possible.

### Documentation Standards
- Record time of arrest, interventions, and outcomes.

### Case Example
> Witnessed cardiac arrest with bystander CPR in progress. What steps should EMS take on arrival?

### Quick Reference Table
| Step         | Action             | Note      |
|--------------|--------------------|-----------|
| Defibrillation| AED ASAP          | Resume CPR |

### Review Questions
1. What is the compression rate for adult CPR?
2. When should CPR be paused?
3. What does AED stand for?
