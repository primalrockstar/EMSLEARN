1. Introduction to Emergency Medical Transport
An ambulance is a vehicle used for treating and transporting patients who
need emergency care to the hospital.
Emergency medical transport aims to provide effective preparation for
transport.
It also focuses on safe emergency vehicle operations.
Appropriate transport decisions are covered.
Safe patient transfer techniques are a key part.
A responsible approach to patient care during transport is emphasized.
EMTs play a vital role in each phase of an ambulance call.
2. Ambulance Design and Equipment
Type of Design Description
Type 1 Basic ambulance design
Type 2 Basic ambulance design
Type 3 Basic ambulance design
Modern ambulances are designed based on nfpa 1917, the standard for
automotive ambulances.
Designs incorporate suggestions from the ambulance industry and EMS
personnel.
Components include a driver's compartment.
There is a patient's compartment large enough for two EMTs and at least one
supine patient.
Additional patients can be seated on the bench or swivel seat with safety
restraints.
Equipment and supplies are needed for emergency medical care at the scene
and during transport.
Supplies also safeguard personnel and patients from hazardous
conditions.
They also carry out light extrication procedures.
A two-way radio is included for communication.
Equipment and supplies should be durable and standardized.
They are stored according to how urgently and often they are used.
Items for life-threatening conditions are placed within easy reach.
Items for cardiac arrest, bleeding, and blood pressure are placed at the
sides of the stretcher.
Cabinets and drawers should have transparent fronts and be labeled.
They should open easily and close securely.
Medical equipment includes basic supplies, PPE, sharps containers, airway
and ventilation equipment, wound supplies, splinting, childbirth supplies, AED,
patient transfer equipment, medications, and communications.
Airway and ventilation equipment includes OPAs and NPAs for different ages,
CPAP equipment, and advanced airway equipment.
Portable artificial ventilators that operate independently of oxygen are
needed.
Bag valve masks, non-rebreathers, nebulizer masks, and suction units are
included.
At least two types of oxygen supply units, portable and installed, are
required.
CPR equipment includes a CPR board and potentially a mechanical device for
chest compressions.
Patient transfer equipment includes stretchers, stair chairs, backboards, and
immobilization devices.
A jump kit is a five-minute kit with everything needed within the first five
minutes, except the AED.
Safety equipment includes warning devices, fire extinguishers, hard hats,
floodlights, and flashlights.
Navigational aids like GPS and MDTs are used.
Detailed street maps should also be kept as backup.
extrication equipment is kept in an outside compartment for simple light
extrication.
At least one EMT should be in the patient compartment during transport.
3. The Nine Phases of an Ambulance Call: Preparation and
Dispatch
An ambulance call has nine different phases.
The first phase is preparation.
In the preparation phase, all equipment and supplies are checked and made
ready.
New equipment is placed only after proper instruction and medical director
consultation.
Equipment should be durable and standardized.
Daily inspections are part of the preparation phase.
Inspections include checking fuel, oil, transmission fluid, engine cooling,
batteries, and brake fluid.
Wheels, tires, interior, and exterior lights are checked.
Windshield wiper fluid, horn, siren, and air conditioner are checked.
Communication systems must work.
Windows and mirrors must be clean.
Medical and safety equipment is inspected for cleanliness, quality, and
function.
Standard traffic safety rules are reviewed.
Safety devices like seat belts must be working properly.
Oxygen tanks and all equipment must be secured appropriately.
The second phase is dispatch.
Dispatch must be accessible 24 hours a day.
The dispatcher gathers information about the call.
This includes the nature of the call, the caller's name, location, and
callback number.
The exact location, number of patients, severity of conditions, and other
pertinent information are gathered.
4. The Nine Phases of an Ambulance Call: En Route and Arrival at
the Scene
The third phase is en route.
The en route phase to the scene is often the most dangerous.
Crashes cause many serious injuries.
Always fasten seat belts and shoulder harnesses before moving the
ambulance.
Review dispatcher information and prepare to assess and care for the patient.
Assign specific duties and scene management tasks.
Decide which equipment to take to the patient.
The fourth phase is arrival at the scene.
If first on scene, perform a scene size-up and report findings to dispatch.
Look for safety hazards for all personnel, bystanders, and the patient.
Evaluate the need for additional units or assistance.
Determine the mechanism of injury or nature of illness.
Evaluate the need for spinal precautions.
Follow standard precautions for mass casualty incidents.
Estimate and communicate the number of patients to the incident
commander.
Park safely at the scene.
Choose a position that allows efficient traffic flow.
Park 100 feet before or past a crash to create a barrier.
Do not park alongside the scene as it may block other vehicles.
Park uphill and upwind of smoke or hazardous materials.
Leave warning lights or devices on.
Keep a safe distance from operations at the scene.
Stay away from fires, hazards, downed wires, and unstable structures.
Set the parking brake.
Park as close as possible to facilitate care and transport.
If blocking traffic is necessary, do so quickly and safely.
Traffic control is for orderly flow, warning other drivers, and preventing
another crash.
Place warning devices like reflectors on both sides of a crash as soon as
possible.
5. The Nine Phases of an Ambulance Call: Patient Transfer and
Transport
The fifth phase is the transfer of the patient.
The patient must be prepared for transport.
This includes securing the patient to a backboard, scoop stretcher, or
wheeled ambulance stretcher.
Properly lift the patient into the patient compartment.
Secure the patient with at least three body straps.
Use deceleration or stopping straps over the patient's shoulders.
This is especially important if the patient is lying flat or on a backboard.
The sixth phase is en route to the receiving facility, also called transport.
Provide dispatch with information when ready to leave.
This includes the number of patients and the destination.
Beginning mileage may also be reported in some jurisdictions.
Monitor the patient en route.
Recheck stable patients every 15 minutes.
Recheck unstable patients every 5 minutes.
Contact the receiving facility to inform them of arrival.
Do not abandon the patient emotionally.
Be aware of the patient's level of need.
Use common sense and defensive driving techniques.
6. The Nine Phases of an Ambulance Call: Delivery, En Route to
Station, and Post-Run
The seventh phase is arrival at the receiving facility and patient delivery.
Inform dispatch as soon as you arrive at the hospital.
Report your arrival to the triage nurse or other arriving personnel.
Physically transfer the patient.
Present a complete verbal report.
Complete a detailed patient report.
The eighth phase is en route to the station.
Restock items used during the call if not done at the hospital.
Inform dispatch of your status and location.
The ninth phase is post-run.
Clean and disinfect the ambulance and equipment if not done at the hospital.
Restock supplies if not done at the hospital.
The post-run phase includes completing and filing any additional reports.
Inform dispatch of your status, location, and availability.
This is the appropriate time for debriefing following the call.
Routine ambulance inspections can be performed.
Refuel the vehicle.
cleaning removes dust, dirt, blood, or visible contaminants.
Disinfecting kills pathogenic agents with chemical.
High-level disinfection uses potent means to kill pathogens.
Sterilization removes microbial contamination, often using heat.
After each call, strip used linens and place them in plastic bags.
Discard medical waste in appropriate receptacles.
Wash contaminated areas with soap and water.
Disinfect all non-disposable equipment used.
Clean the stretcher and spillage with an EPA-registered solution or
bleach/water mix.
7. Safe Emergency Vehicle Operations: Driver Characteristics and
Practices
Certain driver characteristics are needed to operate an emergency vehicle.
Physical fitness and alertness are necessary.
Drivers should not be driving if taking medications that cause drowsiness or
slow reaction time.
Driving under the influence of alcohol is prohibited.
Driving after long or multiple consecutive shifts should be avoided.
Notify your employer if you feel unable to safely operate the vehicle due to a
previous shift.
Emotional maturity and stability are necessary to operate under stress.
Drivers cannot drive based on personal preference just because lights and
sirens are on.
The vehicle must be operated with due regard for safety of others and
preservation of property.
Safe driving practices are essential.
All drivers and passengers must wear seatbelts and shoulder restraints.
If removed for care, fasten the seatbelt again as soon as possible.
Unrestrained patients and equipment can become airborne during a collision.
Become familiar with how your vehicle accelerates, corners, sways, and
stops.
On a multi-lane highway, stay in the extreme left or fast lane.
This allows other motorists to move right when they see or hear you.
8. Safe Emergency Vehicle Operations: Siren Use, Anticipation,
and Blind Spots
The decision to use emergency lights and sirens depends on several factors.
These include local protocols and patient conditions.
The anticipated clinical outcome of the patient is considered.
Consider the patient's condition before activating lights and sirens as they
may increase anxiety.
Driver anticipation is crucial.
Always assume motorists have not heard or seen you until proven otherwise.
Look at the direction of other vehicles' front tires for early indication of their
turn.
Always drive defensively.
Maintain a cushion of safety by keeping a safe following distance.
Avoid being tailgated from behind.
Ensure blind spots in mirrors do not prevent seeing other vehicles or
pedestrians.
To distance yourself from a tailgater, slow down or contact police.
Never get out of the ambulance to confront a driver.
There are three blind spots around the ambulance.
The rearview mirror creates a blind spot in front of the driver.
The rear of the vehicle cannot be fully seen through the mirror.
There are blind spots on the sides of the vehicle.
Scan mirrors frequently for hazards.
Use a spotter and predetermined hand signals when backing up.
9. Safe Emergency Vehicle Operations: Speed, Vehicle Size, and
Road Conditions
Excessive speed is unnecessary, dangerous, and does not increase patient
survival chances.
It makes providing care in the back difficult.
Excessive speed hinders the driver's reaction time.
It increases the time and distance needed to stop.
siren syndrome may cause drivers to drive faster due to anxiety.
A siren requests drivers to yield, but they do not always do this.
Vehicle size and distance are critical for maneuvering, driving, and parking.
Preventable accidents often happen when backing up.
Always use a ground guide outside the ambulance when backing.
Vehicle size and weight greatly influence braking and stopping distances.
Road positioning refers to the vehicle's position on the roadway.
To keep the ambulance in the proper lane when cornering, enter high on the
outside and exit low to the inside.
Ambulances have a longer braking time and stopping distance.
The uneven weight distribution makes ambulances prone to roll over.
Be alert to changing weather and road conditions.
hydroplaning can occur at speeds greater than 30 mph when tires lift off the
road on water.
If hydroplaning occurs, gradually slow down without jamming the brakes.
Wet brakes do not slow as efficiently and may cause the vehicle to pull.
Avoid driving through large puddles or moving water.
Decrease visibility in fog, smoke, snow, or heavy rain requires slowing down to
a safe speed.
Always use headlights and watch for stopped or slow-moving vehicles.
On icy or slippery surfaces, good all-weather tires and appropriate speed
reduce traction problems.
Consider using snow tires or chains if permitted by law.
10. Safe Emergency Vehicle Operations: Laws, Regulations, and
Hazards
Emergency vehicle drivers are exempt from some normal regulations during a
call.
However, certain laws and regulations must be followed.
Motor vehicle crashes are a large source of lawsuits against EMS personnel
and services.
When on an emergency call with warning lights and sirens, certain actions
may be allowed.
These include parking in an otherwise illegal location.
Proceeding through a red light or stop sign is allowed, but never without
stopping first.
Driving faster than the posted speed limit may be permitted.
Driving against traffic on a one-way street or making an illegal turn might
be allowed.
Traveling left of center for an otherwise illegal pass is possible.
An emergency vehicle is never allowed to pass a school bus stopped with
flashing red lights.
Warning lights and sirens are governed by three principles.
The call must be a true emergency.
Audible and visible warning devices must be used simultaneously.
The unit must be operated with due regard for the safety of others.
State statutes often grant emergency vehicles the right-of-way to disregard
rules.
However, the operator must not endanger other people or property under
any circumstances.
Know your local right-of-way privileges and exercise them only when
necessary for the patient's well-being.
Police escorts should be used only on unfamiliar territory.
Different tones should be used for warning lights or sirens.
If being guided, follow at a safe distance.
Intersection crashes are the most common and serious type involving
ambulances.
Always be alert when approaching intersections.
If on an urgent call and unable to wait for the light, come to a complete stop.
Check for other motorists and pedestrians before proceeding.
On highways, shut down lights and sirens until reaching the far left lane.
Use the same procedure when exiting as when entering the highway.
On paved roads, operate at a lower speed and maintain a firm grip on the
steering wheel.
It is unlawful to exceed the speed limit in school zones, regardless of patient
condition.
11. Safe Emergency Vehicle Operations: Distractions and Fatigue
When the ambulance is in motion, focus entirely on driving and anticipating
roadway hazards.
Minimize distractions from mobile dispatch terminals.
Minimize distractions from mounted radios, stereos, cell phones, or
eating/drinking.
When driving alone, focus on figuring out the safest route and mentally
preparing for the call.
These situations demand complete attention and focus.
Understand that fatigue is a risk.
Recognize when you are fatigued and alert your partner or supervisor.
You should be placed out of service until the fatigue has passed.
You must be capable of operating the vehicle safely before returning to
service.
12. Air Medical Operations: Types of Air Ambulances and
Medevac Criteria
Air medical operations use air ambulances to evacuate medical and trauma
patients.
There are two different kinds of air ambulances.
Fixed wing units are used for interfacility transfers over greater distances,
like 200 to 250 miles.
rotary wing units, which are helicopters, are efficient for shorter distances.
Specially trained crews accompany air ambulance flights.
EMT duties are limited to providing ground support.
Medical evacuation (medevac) is performed exclusively by helicopters.
Capabilities, protocols, and procedures vary between EMS systems.
Reasons for calling a medevac include:
Transport time to the hospital by ground is too long.
Road traffic or environmental conditions prohibit ground ambulance use.
The patient requires advanced care beyond the EMT's capabilities.
Multiple patients may overwhelm hospital resources reachable by ground.
Patients who may receive a medevac include those with time-dependent
injuries or illnesses.
Patients suspected of stroke, heart attack, or spinal injury are candidates.
Patients found in remote areas may receive a medevac.
Trauma patients and candidates for limb replantation are included.
Patients needing a burn center, hyperbaric chamber, or venomous bite
center may receive a medevac.
Generally, the dispatcher should be notified first when calling for a medevac.
In some regions, EMS can communicate with the flight crew after initiating the
request.
13. Air Medical Operations: Establishing a Landing Zone and
Safety
Establishing a landing zone is crucial for air medical operations.
The safest and most effective way to land and take off is similar to fixed-wing
aircraft.
Landing at a slight angle allows for safer operations.
Establishing the landing zone is the responsibility of the ground EMS crew.
An appropriate site should be a hard or grassy level surface.
The recommended size is 100 by 100 feet, but no less than 60 by 60 feet.
Clear all loose debris from the landing zone.
The area should be cleared of overhead or tall hazards.
Mark the landing site using weighted cones.
An emergency vehicle can be positioned at a corner with headlights facing
inward to form an X.
Never use caution tape or ask people to mark the spot.
Do not use flares.
Move non-essential persons and vehicles to a safe distance outside the
landing zone.
Communicate the direction of strong wind to the flight crew.
For landing zone safety, stay away from the helicopter unless directed by the
pilot or crew.
Keep a safe distance from the aircraft when it is on the ground or "hot"
(blades spinning).
Stay outside the landing zone perimeter unless directed to enter.
If asked to enter, stay away from the tail rotor as the tips are invisible.
Always approach the helicopter from the front.
Approach only after the pilot or flight crew member signals it is clear.
Enter only in the area between 10 o'clock and 2 o'clock.
Never duck under the body, tail, or rear section of the helicopter.
Walk in a crouched position when approaching the aircraft.
Be familiar with your jurisdiction's helicopter hand signals.
Make certain all patient care equipment and the patient are properly secured.
Some helicopters load patients from the side, while others have rear loading
doors.
Smoking and open flames are not permitted within 50 feet of the aircraft.
Wear eye protection at all times.
14. Air Medical Operations: Special Considerations and Issues
There are special considerations for helicopter operations.
For night landings, do not shine spotlights or flashlights into the air as they
may temporarily blind the pilot.
Direct low-intensity headlights or lanterns towards the ground at the landing
site.
Illuminate overhead hazards or obstructions if possible.
If landing on uneven ground, use extra caution.
The main rotor blade will be closer to the ground on the uphill side.
Approach the aircraft from the downhill side only, or as directed by the flight
crew.
For a medevac at a hazmat incident, immediately notify the flight crew of the
presence of hazardous material.
Consult the flight crew and incident commander about the best approach and
distance for the medevac.
The landing zone should be uphill and upwind from the hazmat scene.
Properly decontaminate patients before loading them into the helicopter.
Several factors influence the decision to request a medevac.
These include access and the severity of the weather.
Most helicopter services are limited to flying below 10,000 feet above sea
level.
medevac helicopters fly between 130 to 150 miles per hour.
Due to the confined space in the cabin, assess the number and size of
patients that can be safely transported.
medevac flights are extremely expensive compared to ambulance transport.
