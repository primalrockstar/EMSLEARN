1. Introduction to Vehicle Extrication and Special Rescue in EMS
This chapter covers vehicle extrication and special rescue operations for ems
personnel.
It details ems rescue operations, including vehicle extrication and its 10
phases.
Various specialized components of ems operations are described, such as
tactical ems, trench rescue, and high angle rescue.
The role of EMTs in these operations is explained.
Safety aspects of these operations are also discussed.
EMTs will usually not be responsible for rescue but may assist with
extrication.
2. Safety Considerations in Extrication Operations
Extrication requires mental and physical preparation.
Priority is patient care, but personal and team safety must come first.
Vehicle safety systems can become hazards after a collision.
Shock-absorbing bumpers may be compressed or loaded.
Approach vehicles from the side to avoid injury from releasing bumpers.
Airbags are supplemental restraints required in all cars.
Airbags fill with gas and quickly deflate.
Airbags are located in the steering wheel, dash, doors, and seats.
Non-deployed airbags may inflate spontaneously.
Maintain clearance around side-impact (5-inch), driver-side (10-inch), and
passenger-side (20-inch) airbags.
Haze from deployed airbags is caused by corn starch or talc.
Protective gear reduces eye or lung irritation.
alternative fuel vehicles present hazards.
Vehicles can be powered by electricity, hybrid mix, propane, natural gas,
methanol, or hydrogen.
Disconnect the battery to prevent fire or explosion.
Batteries may be in the trunk or under seats in alternative fuel vehicles.
Hybrid vehicles may have more than one battery.
Hybrid batteries have higher voltage than traditional ones.
High voltage systems may take up to 10 minutes to de-energize.
Avoid high voltage cables, which are typically orange.
Damaged high voltage batteries may give off toxic fumes.
Do not approach vehicles if an unusual odor is detected.
Retreat if you experience burning in your eyes or throat.
3. Fundamentals of Extrication: Roles, Responsibilities, and
Communication
Your primary concern in extrication is safety.
Primary roles of ems providers are to provide emergency medical care and
prevent further injury.
You may provide care while extrication is ongoing.
Extrication is removal from entrapment or a dangerous situation.
entrapment is being caught with no way out or having a body part trapped.
Roles and responsibilities often vary by jurisdiction.
ems providers assess, provide medical care, triage, package patients, and
provide transport.
The rescue team secures and stabilizes the vehicle, provides access, and
extricates patients.
Law enforcement controls traffic, maintains order, and establishes a
perimeter.
Firefighters extinguish fires, prevent ignition, ensure vehicle safety, and
remove spilled fuel.
Good communication and clear leadership are essential for safe and efficient
care.
4. The 10 Phases of Extrication
There are 10 phases of extrication.
Phase Description Source
1. Preparation Preparing for an incident requiring extrication.
Includes pre-incident training and checking tools.
2. En Route Following procedures and safety precautions
similar to an ambulance call.
3. Arrival and
Size Up
Positioning the ambulance for safety and access.
Putting on PPE and looking for hazards. Evaluating
hazards and determining patient count.
4. Hazard
Control
Dealing with hazards like downed electrical lines,
family members, bystanders, and unstable vehicles.
Disconnecting battery cables.
5. Support
Operations
Lighting the scene, establishing staging areas, or
marking helicopter landing zones. Fire and rescue
personnel work together.
6. Gaining
Access
Accessing the patient after stabilizing the vehicle
and controlling hazards. Method depends on the
situation.
7. Emergency
Care
Providing emergency care to the trapped patient.
Performing a primary assessment. Addressing
hemorrhaging and stabilizing the spine.
8. Patient
Removal
Coordinating with rescue personnel for the best
removal route. Participating in preparation for
removal. Re-evaluating the need for rapid
extrication.
9. Transfer Performing a complete primary assessment after
freeing the patient. Moving the patient in smooth,
slow, controlled steps. Moving the patient as a unit.
10.
Termination
Returning units to service. Checking and cleaning
equipment and the ambulance. Completing
necessary reports.
5. Gaining Access to the Patient
Gaining access is a critical phase of extrication.
The way to gain access depends on the situation, including terrain and
vehicle position.
Consider the patient's location and position, hazards, and vehicle stability.
Rapid vehicle extrication may be needed for urgent situations.
This is done to quickly remove a patient if the environment is threatening
or CPR is needed.
Experienced EMTs can perform this in one minute or less.
Protect the patient from hazards during assessment and extrication.
Always describe actions to the patient, even if unresponsive.
Minimize heat, noise, and force.
simple access is trying to get the patient out quickly without tools or
breaking glass.
Automobiles are built for ease of entry and exit.
Use door handles or roll down windows before breaking glass.
Forcible entry tools may be necessary.
The rescue team should provide access.
If the rescue team hasn't arrived, use tools like hammers, pry bars, or
hacksaws if available.
complex access requires special tools and training.
This includes pneumatic or hydraulic devices.
It also includes breaking windows and removing roofs.
These advanced skills are typically done by specialized teams.
6. Emergency Care and Patient Removal During Extrication
Providing emergency care to a trapped patient is similar to any other patient.
Perform a primary assessment and provide care once the scene is safe.
Address hemorrhaging with direct pressure or a tourniquet.
Provide manual stabilization for the cervical spine.
Open the airway and give high-flow O2 if needed.
Assist with ventilations if necessary.
Control external bleeding and treat critical injuries.
Rescue personnel should coordinate with you on the best removal route.
Participate in preparing for patient removal.
Determine the urgency of extrication.
Determine where to position yourself to protect the patient.
Plan how to move the patient to the backboard and stretcher.
Your input helps the rescue team plan extrication that protects the patient.
Re-evaluate if rapid extrication is needed.
You will often be placed in the vehicle alongside the patient.
Wear proper protective equipment.
Perform a complete primary assessment once the patient is freed.
Manually stabilize the spine.
Move the patient with smooth, slow, controlled steps.
Designate one person to be in charge of the move.
Choose a path that requires the least manipulation.
Ensure everyone understands the steps and is ready.
Move only on the team leader's command.
Move the patient as a unit.
Continue to protect the patient from hazards.
Continue additional assessment and treatment after placing the patient on
the stretcher.
7. Specialized Rescue Situations
Sometimes patients can only be reached by teams trained in special technical
rescues.
These teams have special skills.
Specialized
Rescue Type
Description and Considerations Source
Technical
Rescue
Situations
Requires special skills and equipment. Only
trained personnel should enter. Many team
members are also EMRs or EMTs. Ensure the
team is summoned and en route.
Search and
Rescue
Ambulance is usually summoned to the incident
command post when a person is lost outdoors.
Your role is to stand by until the person is found.
May stay with family members.
Trench Rescue Cave-ins and trench collapses often have poor
outcomes. Falling dirt weighs about 100 pounds
per cubic foot. Risk of secondary collapse exists.
Vehicles must park 500 feet away.
Tactical
Emergency
Medical Support
EMTs take precautions due to potential violence.
Responding units wait until law enforcement
secures the scene. Specially trained EMTs are
incorporated into SWAT units.
Structure Fires Ambulance is often dispatched with the fire
department. Ask the incident commander where
to park and stage. Determine if there are injured
patients or if you are standing by.
Trench collapse victims may become hypoxic from dirt weight.
All vehicles should be turned off at trench scenes to avoid vibration.
Road traffic should be diverted from the 500-foot safety area.
Construction vehicles at the site may be unstable.
Medical or rescue personnel should never enter a trench without proper
shoring.
Medical personnel trained in these rescues provide most medical care.
Be prepared to receive patients once extricated.
For tactical situations, wait for law enforcement to secure the scene.
Many communities integrate trained EMTs into police SWAT units.
Report to the incident commander for instructions at tactical scenes.
Turn off lights, sirens, and outside radio speakers when nearing the scene.
The command post is usually in an area safe from the suspect.
Remain in the command post area.
Planning measures are key in tactical situations.
The incident commander identifies locations, determines scene safety, and
designates landing zones.
Search and rescue in a burning building requires special training and
equipment.
Firefighters in turnout gear and breathing apparatus perform these
operations.
Hazardous materials can complicate a scene.
8. Key Takeaways and Review Questions
Proper protective equipment varies depending on hazards.
Blood and fluid impermeable gloves should be used during all patient
contacts.
The first phase of extrication is preparation.
If a power line is entangled in a wrecked vehicle, retreat until the power is off.
Entering a vehicle by breaking a back window is complex access because it
requires tools.
simple access is rolling the window down.
Once access is gained to a patient pinned by the steering wheel, perform a
primary assessment and provide emergency care.
While the EMT is assessing the patient in the vehicle, the rescue team
assesses entrapment and determines the safest way to extricate.
Proper removal of a critically injured patient involves moving in slow, smooth,
controlled steps as a unit.
Rescue from a grain silo bin is a confined space rescue.
A backboard should be left in the ambulance during a search in a wooded
area.
At a trench collapse scene, the ambulance should be parked at least 500 feet
away.
