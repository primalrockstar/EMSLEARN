1. Introduction to Respiratory Emergencies and Anatomy
Respiratory emergencies are significant in all age groups, including infants,
children, and adults [2].
EMTs frequently encounter patients experiencing dyspnea, which means
difficulty breathing [5].
The cause of dyspnea can be challenging to identify, but timely care can still
be life-saving [5].
Understanding the respiratory system's anatomy is crucial for managing these
emergencies [6].
The respiratory system includes the diaphragm, chest wall muscles,
accessory muscles, and nerves from the brain and spinal cord [7].
The upper airway consists of structures above the larynx, such as the nose,
mouth, jaw, oral cavity, pharynx, and larynx [8].
The larynx serves as the division point between the upper and lower airways
[8].
2. Physiology of Respiration and Pathophysiology of Impaired
Breathing
The main function of the lungs is respiration, the exchange of oxygen and
carbon dioxide [10].
Air travels through the trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, and finally to the alveoli
where gas exchange happens [11].
Respiration involves two processes: inspiration and expiration [12].
Oxygen enters the blood, and carbon dioxide is removed [13].
In healthy lungs, this exchange occurs rapidly at the alveoli through diffusion
[13].
The brain stem monitors carbon dioxide levels in the blood [16].
High carbon dioxide levels lead to faster, deeper breathing, while low levels
slow breathing down [17].
Gas exchange can be hindered by airway abnormalities, disease, trauma, or
issues with pulmonary vessels [19].
Process Description Gas Exchange
Inspiration Oxygen is provided to the
blood
Occurs rapidly at the alveoli
through diffusion
Expiration Carbon dioxide is removed
from the body
Carbon dioxide returns to the lungs
and is exhaled
3. Carbon Dioxide Retention and Hypoxic Drive
Some patients have consistently high levels of carbon dioxide in their blood
[20].
Over time, this can impair the respiratory center in the brain [20].
This is often seen in patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease
(COPD) [20].
Their ability to exhale carbon dioxide is hindered [21].
The brain adapts to these high levels [22].
It switches to a backup system based on low oxygen levels to control
breathing [22].
This backup system is called hypoxic drive [22].
Caution is advised when giving oxygen to these patients [22].
4. Causes and Signs of Dyspnea
Dyspnea can result from many different conditions [23].
Altered mental status can indicate the brain is hypoxic (low oxygen) [23].
Medical conditions causing difficulty breathing include pulmonary edema, hay
fever, pleural effusion, airway obstruction, hyperventilation syndrome,
environmental or industrial exposures, carbon monoxide poisoning, or drug
overdose [23].
Situations leading to dyspnea can involve breathing too fast, obstructed gas
exchange by fluid, infection, or collapsed alveoli, damaged alveoli, obstructed
air passages by spasm, mucus, or weakness, obstructed blood flow to lungs
by a blood clot, or a pleural space filled with air or fluid [24].
Table 16-2 in the book shows signs and symptoms of inadequate breathing
[25].
Dyspnea is common in patients with cardiopulmonary diseases [26].
Congestive heart failure (CHF) causes the heart to pump poorly, leading to
oxygen deprivation [26].
Severe pain can also cause rapid, shallow breathing without primary lung
issues [26].
Condition Description / Effect on Breathing
Pulmonary Edema Fluid in the lungs [23]
Hay Fever Allergic reaction causing cold-like symptoms [23]
Pleural Effusion Collection of fluid around the lungs [23]
Obstruction of the Airway Mechanical blockage [23]
Hyperventilation Syndrome Over breathing leading to low carbon dioxide levels
[23]
Environmental/Industrial
Exposures
Inhaling harmful substances [23]
Carbon Monoxide Poisoning Inhaling odorless, poisonous gas [23]
Drug Overdose Can cause hypoxia or dyspnea [23]
Congestive Heart Failure
(CHF)
Heart pumps ineffectively, depriving the body of
oxygen [26]
Severe Pain Can cause rapid, shallow breathing without primary
pulmonary dysfunction [26]
Obstruction of Gas
Exchange
By fluid, infection, collapsed alveoli, damaged
alveoli, mucus, spasm, blood clot, or pleural air/fluid
[24]
Breathing Too Fast Can be a sign of dyspnea [24]
5. Upper and Lower Airway Infections
Infectious diseases can cause dyspnea by affecting various parts of the
airway [29].
Inadequate oxygen delivery to tissues is often due to some form of
obstruction [31].
Infectious obstructions can include mucus and secretions in major passages
(like colds or diphtheria), or swelling of soft tissues in the upper airway (like
epiglottitis or croup) [32].
Stridor is a sound produced by upper airway infections, often described as a
seal bark [36].
Impaired oxygen exchange in the alveoli (lower airway) is seen in pneumonia
[36].
Using protective equipment (PPE) is important when in contact with patients
with infectious diseases [37].
Croup is typically seen in children aged 6 months to 3 years, causing
inflammation and swelling of the pharynx, larynx, and trachea [38]. Hallmarks
are stridor and a seal bark cough, and it responds well to humidified oxygen
[41].
Epiglottitis is inflammation of the epiglottis, usually bacterial and more
common in children, though it can occur in adults [44]. Patients, especially
children, may sit in a tripod position, drool, and should be handled gently with
high-flow oxygen and nothing placed in their mouths [45].
RSV is a common and highly contagious viral illness in children affecting lungs
and breathing passages, leading to bronchitis and pneumonia [47]. Assess for
dehydration and treat airway/breathing problems [49].
Bronchiolitis is a viral illness often caused by RSV, affecting newborns and
toddlers, where bronchioles become inflamed, swell, and fill with mucus [50].
Oxygen therapy and frequent reassessment for respiratory distress are
needed [51].
Pneumonia is a lung infection, often secondary to an upper respiratory
infection that moves downward [52]. Bacterial pneumonia has a quick onset
with high fevers, while viral pneumonia is more gradual and less severe [54]. It
especially affects chronically or terminally ill people [57]. Fever is a key sign [58]
. Airway support and supplemental oxygen are important [60].
Pertussis (whooping cough) is an airborne bacterial infection mostly affecting
children under six, characterized by fever and a "whoop" sound on inspiration
after coughing [62]. It's highly contagious via droplets, and suctioning may be
needed [62].
Influenza Type A is an animal respiratory disease that mutated to infect
humans, transmitted via direct contact with nasal secretions and aerosolized
droplets [62]. Symptoms include high fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches,
headache, and fatigue, and it can lead to pneumonia or dehydration [64].
COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) is a coronavirus transmitted through droplets,
airborne particles, and direct contact [65]. It primarily affects the elderly, those
in close quarters, and those with weakened immune systems, but young and
healthy adults can also be infected [66]. Symptoms include high fever, cough,
inspirational chest pain, vomiting, diarrhea, and loss of smell, with rapid
respiratory deterioration possible [68].
Tuberculosis (TB) is a bacterial infection mainly affecting the lungs but can
be in other organs [70]. It can be inactive for years [70]. Symptoms include
fever, cough, fatigue, night sweats, and weight loss [71]. It's more prevalent in
homeless individuals, prison inmates, nursing home residents, IV drug/alcohol
abusers, and those with HIV [71]. Minimum PPE includes gloves, eye
protection, and an N95 respirator if TB is suspected [72].
6. Other Respiratory Conditions: Pulmonary Edema and COPD
Pulmonary edema occurs when the left side of the heart cannot pump blood
from the lungs effectively [72]. Fluid backs up in the alveoli and lung tissue [73].
It's usually a result of congestive heart failure (CHF), where the heart muscle
is too weak to keep up with fluid [74].
Patients often have dyspnea with rapid, shallow respirations [75].
Severe cases may show frothy pink sputum from the mouth and nose [76].
Most patients have a history of chronic CHF, but pulmonary edema can occur
without heart disease [77].
Fluid in the alveoli interferes with oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange [77].
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a lung disease with
chronic, irreversible airflow obstruction [79].
It's an umbrella term including emphysema and chronic bronchitis [79].
Tobacco smoke often irritates the bronchial tubes, causing chronic bronchitis
[79].
Chronic bronchitis involves ongoing irritation of the trachea and bronchi with
constant excessive mucus production [80]. This mucus obstructs small
airways and alveoli [80].
Airways are weakened, and protective lung mechanisms are destroyed [80].
Chronic oxygen problems can lead to right-sided heart failure and fluid
retention [80].
Pneumonia can easily develop [80].
Repeated irritation and pneumonia can scar the lungs [81].
Emphysema is the loss of elasticity in lung material from chronic stretching of
alveoli [81].
Smoking directly destroys lung tissue elasticity [81].
Most COPD patients have elements of both chronic bronchitis and
emphysema [81].
COPD affects the alveoli, making gas exchange difficult [82].
Wet lung sounds (bronchi or crackles/rales) are associated with pulmonary
edema (fluid) [83].
Dry lung sounds (wheezes) are associated with COPD [85].
However, not all COPD patients will wheeze, and not all CHF patients will have
crackles; treat the patient, not just the lung sounds [87].

7. Allergic Reactions Affecting the Airway: Hay Fever, Asthma, and
Anaphylaxis
Hay fever, asthma, and anaphylaxis are grouped together because they
result from allergic reactions (inhaled, ingested, or injected) [87].
Asthma is an acute spasm of the bronchioles with excessive mucus
production and swelling of the airway lining [88].
It affects all ages but is most prevalent in children aged 5-17 [88].
Asthma produces characteristic wheezing as the patient exhales through
narrowed airways [89].
Acute asthma attacks can be triggered by allergic reactions (food, allergens),
emotional distress, exercise, or respiratory infection [90].
In its most severe form, an allergic reaction can cause anaphylaxis [91].
Hay fever causes cold-like symptoms: runny nose, sneezing, congestion, and
sinus pressure [92]. Symptoms are from an allergic reaction to outdoor
airborne allergens like pollen [92].
Anaphylactic reactions are severe allergic reactions with severe airway
swelling and widespread blood vessel dilation [93].
They may be associated with hives, itching, and signs of shock [93].
Lung sounds can be similar to asthma [93].
Airway swelling can completely obstruct the airway [93].
Treatment includes epinephrine, oxygen, and antihistamines [93].
8. Other Respiratory Conditions: Pneumothorax, Pleural Effusion,
and Airway Obstruction
Pneumothorax is the partial or total accumulation of air in the pleural space
[94].
It is most often caused by trauma but can also result from medical conditions
[95].
A spontaneous pneumothorax occurs suddenly, sometimes in patients with
chronic lung infections or young people with weak areas in the lungs [96].
Normally, vacuum-like pressure in the pleural space keeps the lungs inflated
[96]. When the lung surface is disrupted, air enters the pleural cavity, losing
the negative pressure [97].
Patients with spontaneous pneumothorax become dyspneic and may
complain of pleural or pleuritic chest pain [98].
Breath sounds are absent or decreased on the affected side [98].
Pneumothorax has the potential to become life-threatening [98].
Pleural effusion is a collection of fluid around the lung [98].
This fluid compresses the lung and causes dyspnea [99].
Causes include irritation, infection, chronic heart failure, or cancer [99].
Breath sounds are decreased in the area of the effusion [99].
Patients often feel better sitting upright [99].
Patients with dyspnea may have a mechanical obstruction of the airway [100]
.
In semi-conscious or unconscious patients, obstruction can be caused by
vomit, foreign objects, improper head positioning, or the tongue falling back
[101].
If a patient was eating before dyspnea onset, a foreign body airway
obstruction should be considered [101].
9. Other Respiratory Conditions: Pulmonary Emboli and
Hyperventilation
A pulmonary embolus is anything in the circulatory system that travels and
lodges, obstructing blood flow in the pulmonary area [103].
Circulation can be partially or completely cut off [103].
Emboli can be blood clot fragments or foreign bodies like air bubbles [104].
A pulmonary embolus is a blood clot that travels through the venous system
and right side of the heart to lodge in the pulmonary artery [105].
Signs and symptoms include dyspnea, tachycardia (fast heart rate),
tachypnea (fast breathing), varying hypoxia degrees, cyanosis, and acute
chest pain [106].
A large embolus can cause complete obstruction of blood output from the
right heart, resulting in sudden death [107].
Hyperventilation is breathing excessively to the point that arterial carbon
dioxide levels fall below normal [107].
It can indicate a life-threatening illness, possibly the body compensating for
acidosis (acid buildup in blood/tissues) [108].
It can also result in alkalosis (abnormally low bloodstream volume/basic
blood) [109].
Signs and symptoms of hyperventilation syndrome, such as a panic attack,
include anxiety, dizziness, numbness/tingling in hands/feet, and painful
hand/foot spasms (carpal pedal spasm) [111].
The decision of whether hyperventilation is due to a life-threatening illness or
panic attack should not be made outside the hospital [112].
10. Environmental/Industrial Exposure and Carbon Monoxide
Poisoning
Breathing problems can be caused by environmental or industrial exposures
[114].
This includes inhaling substances like pesticides, cleaning solutions,
chemicals, and chlorine or other gases accidentally released [114].
Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning is caused by an odorless, highly
poisonous gas [115].
It is the leading cause of accidental poisoning deaths in the US [115].
CO is produced by fuel-burning household appliances and is present in smoke
[115].
Symptoms include flu-like complaints and dyspnea [116].
It is important not to put yourself at risk in these situations [116].
High flow oxygen via a non-rebreathing mask is the best treatment for
conscious patients with CO poisoning [116].
11. Patient Assessment in Respiratory Emergencies
Scene size-up is crucial, always starting with assessing safety [116].
Using PPE is important, especially with infectious respiratory diseases and
toxic substances [116].
If multiple people have dyspnea, consider an airborne hazardous material
release [117].
Determine the nature of illness by asking why 9-1-1 was called and
questioning the patient, family, or bystanders [118].
The primary assessment focuses on identifying immediate life threats [120].
Form a general impression of the patient's distress level, noting age and
position [120].
Use the AVPU scale (Alert, Verbal, Painful, Unresponsive) to check
responsiveness [120].
Ask about the chief complaint [120].
Evaluate the ABC's: ensure an open and adequate airway, assess breathing
adequacy, and listen to lung sounds early [121].
Check breath sounds on both sides of the chest [122].
Abnormal sounds include wheezing, rales, rhonchi, or stridor [122].
For circulation (C), assess pulse rate, rhythm, and quality, evaluate for shock
or bleeding, and check perfusion (skin color, temp, condition) [123].
Make a transport decision (load and go or stay and play) based on whether
it's a life threat [125].
Take a patient history, including history of the illness (investigating the chief
complaint and what the patient has done for the problem) and history of the
patient [126].
Use the SAMPLE history (Signs/Symptoms, Allergies, Medications, Past
Medical History, Last Oral Intake, Events Leading Up) for patients with a
history of respiratory distress or if obtaining from bystanders/family [128].
Use OPQRST (Onset, Provocation, Quality, Radiation, Severity, Time) to
gather information about the breathing problem, similar to assessing pain [128]
.
PASTE (Progression, Associated chest pain, Sputum, Talking/Tiredness,
Exercise intolerance) is an alternative assessment for shortness of
breath/difficulty breathing [128].
Proceed with a secondary assessment only after addressing life threats and
using monitoring devices if available [128].

12. Differentiating COPD and Congestive Heart Failure
Differentiating between COPD and Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) patients is
important [129].
COPD patients are usually over 50 years old [130].
They often have a history of lung problems [131].
Most are current or former long-term cigarette smokers [132].
They complain of chest tightness and constant fatigue [133].
Their chest may have a barrel-like appearance [134].
They often use accessory muscles to breathe [135].
They exhibit abnormal breath sounds [136].
They often exhale through pursed lips [136].
They may have digital clubbing, which are abnormally enlarged fingertips
[136].

edema [73]
13. Management and Treatment of Respiratory Distress
Repeat the primary assessment to check for changes in condition [138].
Confirm that interventions are adequate [138].
Interventions for respiratory problems include providing high flow oxygen (15
liters via non-rebreather) [138].
Positive pressure ventilations may be needed using a bag-valve mask, pocket
mask, or flow-restricted, oxygen-powered device [138].
Airway management techniques like oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal airway
insertion, suctioning, and positioning may be necessary [138].
Non-invasive ventilatory support with CPAP might be provided [138].
Position the patient in a high Fowler's position or position of choice [139].
Assist the patient with respiratory medications [139].
Communicate relevant information to the receiving facility staff [140].
Administer oxygen immediately for respiratory distress [141].
Provide ventilatory support if the patient's mental status is declining, or if
distress is moderate/severe, or respiration depth is inadequate [141].
Monitor the patient's respiratory status and provide emotional support [141].
If the patient has a metered-dose inhaler or small volume nebulizer, call
medical control to see if the medication is indicated [141].
Ensure there are no contraindications for the medication [142].
Most respiratory inhalation medicines relax muscles around air passages,
causing bronchial dilation (airway opening) [142].
Side effects can include increased pulse, nervousness, and muscle tremors
[142].
Medication from an inhaler is delivered to the lungs via the respiratory tract
[143].
Follow skill drills for assisting patients with self-administration of inhalers and
nebulizers [144].
14. Treatment of Specific Respiratory Conditions
For upper or lower airway infections, administer humidified oxygen [145].
Do not suction or place an OPA in a patient with suspected epiglottitis;
position comfortably and transport [146].
For pulmonary edema (fluid in lungs), provide 100% oxygen, suction if
needed, position comfortably (usually seated), provide CPAP if
indicated/allowed, and transport promptly [148].
For COPD, assist with an inhaler, watching for overuse signs (side effects);
position comfortably and transport promptly [153].
For asthma, be ready to suction, assist with an inhaler, provide aggressive
airway management, oxygen, and prompt transport [155].
Hay fever is usually not an emergency, manage the airway and give oxygen
based on distress level [157].
Anaphylaxis is a true emergency; remove the offending agent, provide
aggressive airway management, oxygen, prompt transport, and administer Epi
if allowed by protocol [158].
For spontaneous pneumothorax, provide oxygen, transport to the hospital,
and monitor carefully [160].
For pleural effusions, fluid removal must be done at the hospital; provide
oxygen and transport promptly [161].
For airway obstruction: partial obstruction gets supplemental oxygen only;
complete obstruction requires clearing the obstruction then administering
oxygen [162]. Transport rapidly to the emergency department [164].
For pulmonary emboli, supplemental oxygen is mandatory; position
comfortably; clear the airway immediately if coughing up blood; prompt
transport is needed [165].
For hyperventilation, complete primary assessment and gather history; never
have the patient breathe in a paper bag; reassure and provide oxygen if
necessary; prompt transport [167].
For environmental or industrial exposure, ensure patients are
decontaminated; treat with oxygen and adjuncts if needed; suction based on
presentation [170].
For foreign body airway obstruction, perform age-specific clearing
techniques, provide oxygen, and transport [171].
For tracheostomy dysfunction, position comfortably, suction to clear
obstruction, then oxygenate [172].
For asthma in children, give blow-by oxygen and use metered-dose inhalers
as with older patients [173]. Asthma can be life-threatening in older adults [173].
Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disorder affecting lungs/digestive system,
predisposing children to lung infections [174]. Symptoms vary; suction and
oxygenate these patients [174].

15. Review of Key Concepts
The process of oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange in the lungs is called
respiration [176]. Respiration is the exchange of gases between the body and
its environment [176].
Asthma is a respiratory disease causing obstruction of the lower airway
(bronchioles) [177]. Croup and epiglottitis are upper airway infections [177].
Tuberculosis is a potentially drug-resistant bacterial infection transmitted by
coughing [178]. It is dangerous and resistant to antibiotics [179].
Causes of acute dyspnea include asthma, pneumothorax, and pulmonary
emboli [180]. Emphysema is a chronic respiratory disease, not an acute cause
of dyspnea [182].
Bronchiospasm (narrowing/spasming of airways) is most often associated
with asthma [183]. Asthma is a reactive disease caused by bronchiole spasms
[183].
Sudden onset of difficulty breathing with sharp chest pain and cyanosis
despite oxygen is indicative of a pulmonary embolus [184]. Pneumonia is
slower, and MI can cause chest pain but this presentation is classic for emboli
[184]. A pulmonary embolus is a blockage causing pleuritic chest pain [185].
Albuterol (a beta-2 antagonist/agonist) is the generic name for Ventolin or
Proventil [188].
An acute bacterial infection causing swelling of the flap covering the larynx
during swallowing (the epiglottis) is epiglottitis [189]. It is potentially lifethreatening
and caused by bacterial infection of the epiglottis [190].
Difficulty breathing, especially when lying flat, in a patient who recently had a
heart attack suggests pulmonary edema from left-sided heart failure [191].
Lying flat allows fluid to cover more lung surface, while sitting up
concentrates it lower [192].
A 29-year-old conscious and alert patient with 20 respirations is breathing
adequately [194].
