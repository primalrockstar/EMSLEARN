# Module 7: Respiratory & Cardiovascular Emergencies

---

## Chapter 15: Medical Overview

### Overview
Introduces the approach to medical emergencies, including initial assessment, prioritization, and integration of pathophysiology for rapid identification and management.

### Learning Objectives
- Recognize common medical emergencies encountered in EMS.
- Prioritize assessment and treatment.
- Integrate history, symptoms, and risk factors.

### Key Terms
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| NOI | Nature of Illness. |
| Differential Diagnosis | Identifying possible causes for symptoms. |
| Triage | Sorting patients by urgency. |

### Major Concepts & Guidelines
- Use NOI to guide initial assessment.
- Rapidly identify life-threatening conditions.
- Consider medical history and risk factors.

### Procedures / Protocols
- **Medical Assessment:**  
  - Primary survey for life threats.
  - Focused secondary assessment.
- **Triage:**  
  - Use protocols to sort and prioritize.

### Assessment & Clinical Pearls
- Obtain SAMPLE and OPQRST.
- Reassess frequently.

### Documentation Standards
- Record chief complaint, history, assessment, and interventions.

### Case Example
> Patient has sudden weakness and slurred speech. What are priority assessments?

### Quick Reference Table
| Symptom          | Possible Cause | Action           |
|------------------|---------------|------------------|
| Chest pain       | MI, angina    | ECG, aspirin, transport |

### Review Questions
1. What does NOI stand for?
2. List two life-threatening medical emergencies.
3. Why is reassessment important?

## Chapter 16: Respiratory Emergencies

### Overview
Covers recognition and management of respiratory distress, failure, and arrest including asthma, COPD, and pneumonia.

### Learning Objectives
- Recognize signs of respiratory compromise.
- Implement airway and ventilatory support.
- Identify and treat common causes (asthma, COPD, pneumonia).

### Key Terms
| Term   | Definition |
|--------|------------|
| Dyspnea | Difficulty breathing. |
| Hypoxia | Low oxygen levels. |
| Wheezing | High-pitched breath sound, airway narrowing. |

### Major Concepts & Guidelines
- Assess for rate, rhythm, and effort.
- Oxygen and ventilation as first-line interventions.
- Use inhalers/nebulizers as indicated.

### Procedures / Protocols
- **Oxygen Therapy:**  
  - Nasal cannula/mask for mild.
  - BVM for severe failure.
- **Medication:**  
  - Inhaled bronchodilators for asthma/COPD.

### Assessment & Clinical Pearls
- Monitor for fatigue and altered mental statusâ€”signs of impending failure.
- Auscultate lung sounds.

### Documentation Standards
- Record respiratory rate, effort, breath sounds, and interventions.

### Case Example
> Asthmatic child with increased work of breathing. What EMS interventions should be prioritized?

### Quick Reference Table
| Sound     | Meaning           | Intervention |
|-----------|-------------------|--------------|
| Wheezing  | Bronchospasm      | Inhaler      |
| Crackles  | Fluid in alveoli  | Oxygen, transport |

### Review Questions
1. What are early signs of respiratory distress?
2. Name two EMS interventions for respiratory failure.
3. What does wheezing indicate?

## Chapter 17: Cardiovascular Emergencies

### Overview
Explores cardiac emergencies including angina, myocardial infarction (MI), CHF, and arrhythmias, with emphasis on EMS recognition and management.

### Learning Objectives
- Identify signs/symptoms of cardiac emergencies.
- Implement prehospital cardiac care.
- Recognize indications for rapid transport.

### Key Terms
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| MI   | Myocardial Infarction (heart attack). |
| Angina | Chest pain due to reduced blood flow. |
| CHF  | Congestive Heart Failure. |
| Dysrhythmia | Abnormal heart rhythm. |

### Major Concepts & Guidelines
- Cardiac emergencies present with chest pain, dyspnea, palpitations, syncope.
- Early recognition and intervention save lives.
- Use aspirin, nitroglycerin, oxygen per protocols.

### Procedures / Protocols
- **Chest Pain Management:**  
  - Oxygen if hypoxic.
  - Aspirin, nitroglycerin if no contraindications.
  - Monitor ECG if available.

### Assessment & Clinical Pearls
- Pain radiating to jaw/arm may indicate MI.
- CHF may present with pulmonary edema.

### Documentation Standards
- Record onset, duration, quality of pain, interventions, and patient response.

### Case Example
> Middle-aged patient with crushing substernal chest pain. What steps should EMS take?

### Quick Reference Table
| Symptom          | Possible Cause | Treatment           |
|------------------|---------------|---------------------|
| Chest pain       | MI/angina     | Aspirin, nitro, ECG |

### Review Questions
1. What is the classic sign of MI?
2. Name two medications EMS may give for chest pain.
3. When is rapid transport indicated?
