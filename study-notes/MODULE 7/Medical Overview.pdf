1. Introduction to Medical Emergencies
medical emergencies involve illnesses caused by disease [6]. They are different from
trauma emergencies, which result from physical forces [5]. Patients can have both
medical and trauma conditions [7].

2. Patient Assessment in Medical Emergencies
Assessing a medical patient focuses on the nature of illness and chief complaint [19].
Establishing an accurate medical history is crucial [20]. Use dispatch information to guide
your response [21]. Avoid tunnel vision, focusing only on one aspect [22]. Maintain a
professional and calm demeanor [23]. Do not label patients or show biases [24].
Remember a frequent caller may have a different complaint this time [25].
The scene size-up ensures safety for you, your crew, and the patient [26]. Use standard
precautions [27]. Determine the number of patients and if more help is needed [27].
Determine the nature of the illness [28]. Be aware of potentially serious underlying
conditions (index of suspicion) [28]. Initiate spinal immobilization if necessary [28].
The primary assessment includes forming a general impression [29]. Perform a rapid
exam to find life threats [29]. Determine the patient's level of consciousness using AVPU
[29]. Assess airway, breathing, and circulation (ABC) [29].
For conscious patients, ensure an open airway and adequate breathing [30].
Check respiratory rate, depth, and quality [30].
Consider oxygen if breathing is affected [30].
Check the radial pulse [33].
Observe skin color, type, and condition [33].
For unconscious patients, open the airway using the proper technique [31].
Evaluate breathing for several seconds [31].
Apply oxygen, especially with shock, difficulty breathing, or low SpO2 (<94%)
[32].
May need airway adjuncts and ventilatory assistance with a bag valve mask
[32].
Check circulation at the carotid artery [34].
Make a transport decision based on the patient's condition [34].
History taking helps determine the problem or its cause [38]. Gather a thorough history
[39]. Investigate the chief complaint using opqrst (onset, provocation, quality, radiation,
severity, time) [41]. For unconscious patients, survey the scene for medications and
medical devices [40]. Obtain patient history using SAMPLE (allergies, medications, past
history, last oral intake, events) [41]. Record all allergies and medications [41]. Take
medications with you to the hospital [41].
The secondary assessment may happen on scene or en route [42]. Sometimes there is
no time for a secondary assessment [43]. Conscious patients get a limited or detailed
physical exam based on the chief complaint [44]. Unconscious patients always get a
head-to-toe exam to find clues [45]. A full body assessment should be quick to avoid
delaying transport [46]. Examine the head, neck, chest, abdomen, extremities, and back
[46].
Treatment depends on findings and local protocols [47]. Take vital signs: pulse rate,
rhythm, and quality [48]. Assess respirations rate, quality, and regularity [49]. Obtain an
initial blood pressure [50]. Measure systolic and diastolic pressures [51]. Consider using an
automatic blood pressure cuff [51]. Obtain blood glucose levels and pulse oximetry [52].
3. Reassessment and Transport Decisions
Reassessment starts after initial assessment and treatment [53]. It continues throughout
transport [53]. Repeat the primary assessment [54]. Reassess the chief complaint [54].
Consider the need for advanced life support [55]. Repeat the physical exam to find and
treat changes [56]. Obtain vital signs every 5 minutes for unstable patients [58]. Obtain
vital signs every 15 minutes for stable patients [58]. Review all performed treatments [59].
Document any changes from treatments [59]. Adjust treatments as needed [59].
Most emergencies need hospital treatment beyond pre-hospital care [60]. The hospital
offers advanced testing [61]. Administering medicine may be beyond the EMT's scope [61]
. EMTs need direct permission from medical control to give medicine [62]. EMTs can use
an AED on pulseless and apneic patients [63].
Scene time may be longer for medical patients [65]. This allows gathering more
information for the emergency department [65]. Critical patients need rapid transport [66].
Criteria for Rapid Transport
Unconscious or altered mental status [36]
Airway or breathing problems [36]
Obvious circulation problems (bleeding, shock) [36]
Very old or very young patients [66]
Life-threatening conditions require transport with lights and sirens [67]. Non-critical
patients may use non-emergency transport [68]. Transport modes are ground or air [68].
Ground units have EMTs and paramedics [69]. Air units have critical care transport
professionals and paramedics [70]. Generally, transport to the closest hospital [71].
Sometimes another hospital is better for the patient's specific condition [72].
4. Infectious Diseases in Emergency Care
Approach patients with infectious diseases like other medical patients [73]. Perform
scene size-up and standard precautions [73]. Complete the primary assessment [73].
Gather patient history using opqrst for the chief complaint [74]. Obtain sample history
and baseline vital signs [75]. Pay attention to medicines and events leading up to the
problem [76]. Ask about recent travel or contact with travelers [77].
General management focuses on life-threatening conditions from the primary
assessment [78]. Be empathetic [79]. Position the patient for comfort on the stretcher [80].
Keep the patient warm [80]. Always use standard precautions [80]. Follow agency
exposure control plans [81]. Clean equipment properly [81]. Discard disposable supplies
and wash linens [81].

fever, cough, vomiting, bloody diarrhea, body aches, rashes [136]. Place a mask on the
patient [136]. Gather information on travel history [136]. Ask where they traveled, if
vaccinated, exposed, if travel companions are sick, food/water sources [137]. Follow
appropriate PPE and notify receiving facility if a communicable disease is suspected [137]
.
An epidemic is when new cases exceed expectations [82]. A pandemic is a global
outbreak [83].
5. Conclusion and Key Takeaways
Assessing and treating medical patients is challenging [138]. Medical conditions may not
be as apparent as trauma [139]. Treatment may not be straightforward [139]. Delays in
diagnosis can be harmful [140]. Stay calm and use patient assessment skills [140]. Treat
the patient's symptoms [140]. Report to medical control [140]. Transport the patient safely
to the emergency department [140]. Be prepared for patients with both medical and
trauma conditions [141].
