1. Introduction to Patient Assessment
The patient assessment process is crucial in emergency care [6]. It provides a
structured approach to evaluating patients [2]. This process is divided into five main
parts [7].
The five main parts are:
scene size-up [7]
primary assessment [7]
history taking [7]
secondary assessment [7]
reassessment [7]
The order of these steps can vary depending on the patient's condition and
environment [8].
Rarely does a single sign or symptom reveal the patient's full status or
underlying problem [10].
A symptom is what the patient feels and tells you (subjective) [11].
A sign is what you can observe or measure (objective) [11].

2. Scene Size-Up
scene size-up is evaluating the conditions for operation [13]. situational awareness is
vital throughout the call [14]. Dispatch provides initial information [15].
scene size-up combines information and observations for safe operations [16].
Ensuring scene safety is critical [17].
Pre-hospital settings can present minor or major dangers [18].
If a scene is unsafe, make it safe or call for additional resources [19].
Consider traffic safety and environmental conditions [20].
Protect bystanders from becoming patients [22].
Hazards can include environmental, physical, chemical, electrical, water, fire,
explosions, and physical violence [23].
Be aware of potential violence from patients, family, bystanders, gangs, or
crowds [24].
Emergency scenes are dynamic environments [25].
Determine the mechanism of injury (moi) or nature of illness (NOI) [26].
Calls can be medical, trauma, or both [27].
Traumatic injuries result from physical force [27].
MOI terms include blunt trauma and penetrating trauma [29].
For medical patients, determine the NOI [30].
Gather information from the patient, family, or bystanders [31].
Use your senses for clues [31].
Be aware of multiple patients with similar symptoms (e.g., carbon monoxide)
[32]. This may indicate an unsafe scene [32].
MOI or NOI is valuable for preparing patient care [33].
Take standard precautions [34].
Adapt PPE to the pre-hospital task [35].
standard precautions are CDC-recommended measures for dealing with
blood, body fluids, non-intact skin, and mucous membranes [36].
Assume all these pose an infection risk [37].
Initiate standard precautions before patient contact [38].
At minimum, wear gloves before contact [39].
Consider glasses and a mask [40].
Determine the number of patients [41].
Accurately identify the total number of patients [41].
Use the incident command system with multiple patients [42].
Begin triage with multiple patients [42].
triage sorts patients based on condition severity [43].
Consider additional resources [44].
This could include more ambulances, police, helicopters, or fire trucks [44].
Advanced life support or air medical may be needed [45].
Fire departments handle hazmat, technical rescue, extrication, or water
rescue [46].
Law enforcement may be required [47].
Questions for determining additional resources:
Does the scene threaten you or the patient? [48]
How many patients are there? [48]
Do you have resources for their conditions? [48]
3. Primary Assessment
The primary assessment's goal is to identify and treat immediate life threats [49]. This
involves physically examining the patient [49]. You assess level of consciousness,
airway, breathing, and circulation [49].
Form a general impression first [50].
This helps determine priority of care [50].
Note age, sex, race, distress level, and overall appearance [50].
Ensure the patient sees you approaching [51].
Note patient position and movement [51].
Avoid standing over the patient [52].
Address the patient by name and introduce yourself [53].
Ask about the chief complaint [53].
The patient's response offers insight into consciousness, airway,
breathing, and circulation [54].
Treat life-threatening problems immediately [55].
Define the patient's condition as stable, stable but potentially unstable, or
unstable [56].
Scan for and control uncontrolled external bleeding [56]. This takes priority
[56].
Assess the level of consciousness (loc) [57].
LOC indicates neurologic and physiologic status [57].
Assessment of an unconscious patient focuses on ABCs [58].
Sustained unconsciousness suggests a critical respiratory, circulatory, or
CNS problem [58].
Altered LOC in conscious patients may be due to inadequate perfusion,
medication, drugs, alcohol, or poisoning [59].
Use the AVPU mnemonic for responsiveness [60]. Choose one description
[60].
Test patients not responding to verbal stimuli for response to painful
stimulus [60].
Painful stimuli include pinching the arm, skin, or trap area [61]. Also apply
upward pressure along the orbital ring [62].
A patient moaning or withdrawing responds to stimulus [62].
Orient and test mental status by checking memory and thinking [63].
Evaluate ability to remember: Person (name), Place (location), Time (year,
month, date), and Event (what's happening) [64].
Answering all is being alert and oriented times four (A&Ox4) [64].
Any deviation from A&Ox4 or baseline is altered mental status [65].
Identify and treat life threats [66].
Conditions causing sudden death are life threats [66].
Examples include airway obstruction, respiratory failure/arrest, shock,
severe bleeding, or cardiac arrest [66].
Usually, address life threats with ABC (Airway, Breathing, Circulation) [67].
Sometimes, CAB (Circulation, Airway, Breathing) is more appropriate [68].
Assess the Airway (A) [69].
Stay alert for airway obstruction [70].
Ensure the airway remains patent and adequate [71].
Responsive patients talking or crying have an open airway [71].
A conscious patient who cannot speak or cry likely has a severe
obstruction [72].
If an airway problem is found, stop assessment and clear it [73].
If the patient has difficulty breathing and is not breathing, take immediate
corrective actions [73].
Assess airway patency in unresponsive patients [74].
Use the jaw thrust maneuver for potential trauma to open the airway [75].
If jaw thrust doesn't work or trauma is ruled out, use the head tilt chin lift
maneuver [76].
Signs of obstruction in an unconscious patient: obvious trauma, blood,
obstruction, noisy breathing (snoring, bubbling, gurgling, crowing, stridor),
extremely shallow or absent breathing [76].
Assess Breathing (B) [77].
Ensure the patient's breathing is present and adequate after ensuring a
patent airway [77].
Ask: Is the patient breathing? Is it adequate? Is the patient hypoxic? [79].
Perform positive pressure ventilation for patients not breathing, or whose
breathing is too slow or shallow [79].
If breathing is adequate but hypoxic, administer oxygen [80].
Oxygenation goal for most patients is 94-99% saturation [81].
If difficulty breathing develops after primary assessment, re-evaluate the
airway immediately [82].
Consider positive pressure ventilations with an airway adjunct when
respirations exceed 28, are fewer than 8, or are too shallow for adequate
exchange [83].
Shallow respirations show little chest wall movement [83].
Observe effort required for breathing [83]. Look for retractions, accessory
muscle use, nasal flaring [83].
Note two-to-three word dyspnea (shortness of breath when talking) [83].
Look for the tripod position (sitting up and leaning forward) or labored
breathing [84].
respiratory distress is increased effort and rate [85].
respiratory failure is inadequate oxygenation or ventilation [85].
respiratory failure can lead to respiratory arrest if uncorrected [86].
Assess Circulation (C) [87].
Evaluate by assessing mental status, pulse, and skin condition [87].
These are the three parts of circulation assessment [88].
Assess the pulse [89]. Palpate if a pulse is present [89].
Responsive patients older than one year: palpate radial pulse at the wrist
[90].
Unresponsive patients older than one year: palpate carotid pulse at the
neck [91].
Children under one year: palpate brachial pulse in the upper arm [91].
If a pulse cannot be palpated in an unresponsive patient, start CPR [92].
Assess skin condition for perfusion [93]. Evaluate skin color, temperature,
condition, and capillary refill [94].
Skin color: Pale, white, ashen, or gray indicates poor peripheral circulation
[95]. Abnormally flushed or red can indicate high blood pressure [96]. Blue
indicates low oxygen saturation (cyanosis) [96].
Skin temperature: Normal is warm [97]. Abnormal is hot, cold, cool, or
clammy [98].
Moisture: Normal is dry [99]. Wet, moist, or excessively dry/hot suggests a
problem [99].
capillary refill is evaluated in pediatric patients [100]. It assesses circulation
to capillary beds in fingers and toes [100].
Cap refill should restore within two seconds [101].
Test by gently pushing a fingertip until it blanches white [101]. Release and
count how long it takes for the pink color to return [102]. Should be less
than two seconds [102].
Assess and control any external bleeding [103]. This should occur before
addressing airway or breathing [103].
Bleeding from a large vein is a steady flow [104].
Bleeding from an artery is characterized by spurting [104].
Control bleeding by applying direct pressure [105].
If direct pressure fails or there is obvious arterial hemorrhage, apply a
tourniquet [105].
Perform a rapid scan to identify life threats [106].
Identify injuries needing management or protection before transport [106].
This is a 60-90 second exam [106].
It is not a systematic or focused physical exam [106].
Determine patient priority and transport (D) [107]. This follows ABC [107].
High-priority patients include those who are unresponsive, have difficulty
breathing, or uncontrolled bleeding [108].
Other high-priority conditions: altered LOC, severe chest pain, pale
skin/poor perfusion signs, complicated childbirth, or severe pain [108].
Load and go for high-priority patients [108].
The golden hour (or Golden Period) is the time from injury to definitive
care [109]. Treatment of shock and traumatic injuries must occur then to
maximize survival [109].
Immediate transport is key for patients needing care the EMT cannot
provide [109].
The timeline: Discovery/EMS activation (first 20 minutes), platinum 10
minutes (initial assessment, intervention, packaging, getting off scene),
EMS transport/hospital stabilization [110].
Transport decisions are made at this point [111].
Decisions are based on patient condition, availability of advanced care,
transport distance, and local protocols [112].
Step Action
General Impression Note age, sex, race, distress, appearance; determine care
priority [50]
Assess LOC (AVPU) Use AVPU to determine responsiveness; check orientation
(Person, Place, Time, Event) [60]
Identify Life Threats Recognize conditions causing sudden death (airway,
breathing, circulation, bleeding) [66]
Airway Assessment Ensure patent airway; check for obstruction signs; use
maneuvers if needed [70]
Breathing
Assessment
Check presence and adequacy; assess rate, rhythm,
quality, depth; administer oxygen/ventilate [77]
Circulation
Assessment
Assess mental status, pulse, skin condition; control external
bleeding [87]
Rapid Scan Quickly identify any other life threats [106]
Priority/Transport Determine patient priority (high priority conditions); decide
on transport [107]
4. History Taking
history taking is the next part of patient assessment [113]. It includes the patient's
history and the history of the present illness [113]. This provides details about the
chief complaint and symptoms [114].
Document the date, patient age, gender, race, medical history, and current
health status [114].
Investigate the chief complaint and history of the present illness [115].
Begin by introducing yourself and making the patient comfortable [115]. Obtain
permission to treat [115].
Ask simple, direct questions [116]. Use Mr., Miss, or Mrs. with the patient's last
name [116].
Use open-ended questions to determine the chief complaint [116].
Use eye contact to encourage the patient to speak [116]. Repeat statements to
show understanding [116].
If the patient is unresponsive, get information from family or bystanders [117].
Look for medical alert jewelry or documentation [119].
Use the OPQRST mnemonic to gather information on the present illness [121].
Onset: When the problem started [122].
Provocation: What makes the problem better or worse? [123]
Quality: How would you describe the feeling (pain, stabbing, pressure)?
[124]
Region/Radiation: Where the problem is and if it spreads [124].
Severity: On a scale of 0-10, how bad is the pain? [124]
Timing: When did it start? Is it constant or intermittent? [124]
Identify pertinent negatives: negative findings that don't require care or
intervention [121].
Obtain the SAMPLE history [125].
Signs and symptoms [125].
Allergies [125].
Medications [125].
Past pertinent medical history [125].
Last oral intake [125].
Events leading up to the illness or injury [125].
OPQRST is for the present illness, SAMPLE is for the patient history [125].
Critical thinking is essential in assessment [126].
Gather facts for clinical decision making [126].
Evaluate what the information means [126].
Synthesize information into a plan for managing the scene/patient care
[126].
Taking history on sensitive topics requires a professional approach [127].
Alcohol or drugs: Signs can be confused or hidden [127]. Patients may
deny problems [127]. History from dependent patients may be unreliable
[128]. Do not judge [129].
Physical abuse or violence: Report all abuse/domestic violence to
authorities [130]. Follow state laws and local protocols [131]. Do not accuse;
involve law enforcement immediately [132]. This is mandatory reporting
[133].
Sexual history: May be sensitive [133]. Consider all female patients of
childbearing age with lower abdominal pain pregnant until ruled out [134].
Ask about last menstrual period [135]. Inquire about urinary symptoms with
male patients [135]. Ask about potential STDs when appropriate [135].
Special challenges in history taking [136].
Silence: Patience is important [137]. Closed-ended questions (yes/no) may
work best [138]. Consider if silence is a clue to the chief complaint [138].
Overly talkative patients: Reasons can include caffeine, nervousness,
drug use (crack, cocaine, methamphetamines), or physiological issues [139]
.
Multiple symptoms: Prioritize complaints like in triage [140]. Start with the
most serious [140].
Anxiety: Recognize it may be a sign of a serious medical condition [141].
Common in disaster scenes [142]. Anxious patients may show signs of
shock (pale, sweating, shortness of breath, numbness/ tingling, dizziness,
loss of consciousness) [143]. Anxiety can indicate low blood sugar, shock,
or hypoxia [143].
Anger and hostility: Family or bystanders may direct anger at you [145].
Remain calm, reassuring, and gentle [145]. Retreat if the scene is unsafe
until secured [146].
Intoxication: Do not corner an intoxicated patient [147]. Potential for
violence is high [147]. Alcohol dulls senses [148].
Crying: A patient may be sad, in pain, or overwhelmed [149]. Remain calm,
patient, reassuring, and confident [150]. Maintain a soft voice [150].
Depression: A leading cause of disability [151]. Symptoms include sadness,
hopelessness, restlessness, irritability, sleeping/eating disorders,
decreased energy [152]. Being a good listener is effective [153].
Limited cognitive abilities: Keep questions simple; limit medical terms
[154]. Be alert for partial answers; keep asking questions [155]. Rely on
family, caregivers, or friends for answers with severely limited cognitive
function [156].
Cultural challenges: Don't use medical language [157]. Some cultures
prefer same-gender healthcare providers [158]. Gain assistance from
friends, family, or same-culture providers if possible [158].
Language barriers: Find an interpreter if possible [159]. Determine if the
patient understands who you are [159]. Keep questions straightforward and
brief [160]. Use hand signals or gestures if needed [160]. Be aware of
community language diversity [161].
Hearing problems: Ask slowly and clearly [162]. Use a stethoscope as a
hearing aid [162]. Learn simple sign language or use paper/pencil [163].
Visual impairments: Identify yourself verbally upon entering [164]. Return
moved items to their previous position [165]. Explain each step of
assessment and vital signs [165]. Notify the patient before lifting or moving
them [166].
5. Secondary Assessment
The secondary assessment is the fourth section [168]. If the patient is stable and has
an isolated complaint, perform it at the scene [169]. If not, perform it in the ambulance
en route to the hospital [169].
Sometimes, there isn't time for a secondary assessment [171]. Continue
managing life threats during transport [171].
The purpose is to perform a systematic physical exam [172].
This may be a focused assessment based on the chief complaint or a certain
body area/system [172].
How to assess during the physical exam: inspect, palpate, auscultate, and
percuss [172]. Look, listen, and feel [172].
Inspect: Look at the patient for abnormalities [173].
Palpate: Feel for abnormalities [174].
Auscultate: Listen with a stethoscope [174].
The mnemonic DCAP-BTLS helps remember what to look for in trauma
assessments [175].
Compare findings on one side of the body to the other [176].
Deformities [177]
Contusions [177]
Abrasions [177]
Punctures or penetrations [177]
Burns [177]
Tenderness [177]
Laceration [177]
Swelling [177]
The systematic assessment's goal is to identify hidden injuries [178].
Perform a focused assessment on patients with non-significant MOIs or
medical patients [180]. It is typically based on the chief complaint [180].
Focus attention on the affected body part or system [180].
Respiratory system focus (for difficulty breathing) [181]:
Expose and inspect the chest for obstruction signs or trauma [182].
Inspect chest symmetry (both sides rising/falling) [183].
Auscultate and listen to breath sounds, noting abnormalities [184].
Measure respiratory rate, chest rise/fall (tidal volume), and effort [184].
Look for retractions and increased work of breathing [185].
Obtain RRQ (respiratory rate, rhythm, quality, depth) [187].
Normal adult rate is 12-20 breaths/minute [188]. Children breathe faster
[189]. Count breaths in 30 seconds and multiply by two [189].
Respiratory rhythm should be regular or irregular [190]. Regular means
consistent time between chest rises [190]. Irregular can indicate an
underlying medical or trauma condition [191].
Quality of breathing: Normal is silent [192]. Other sounds (advantageous
breath sounds) indicate respiratory problems [192].
Depth of breathing: Amount of air exchanged, depends on tidal rate
and volume [193].
Auscultate breath sounds on both sides and multiple lung fields [193].
Listen for: Normal, snoring (upper respiratory), wheezing (lower),
crackles (lower), rhonchi (lower), stridor (upper) [194].
Cardiovascular system focus (for chest pain) [198]:
Look for trauma to the chest; listen for breath sounds [198].
Consider pulse, respiratory rate, and blood pressure [199].
Pay attention to rate, quality, and rhythm of the pulse [199].
Consider skin findings [200].
Check and compare distal pulses for differences [201].
Consider auscultation for abnormal heart tones [201].
Pulse: Normal adult resting pulse is 60-100 [202]. Younger patients have
faster rates [203].
Assess pulse RRQ (rate, rhythm, quality) [204].
Pulse quality: Strong or bounding [205]. Weak or thready is difficult to
feel [205].
Pulse rhythm: Regular or irregular [206]. Regular has consistent intervals
[206]. Irregular means early or late beats or missed beats [208].
Take blood pressure [209]. It's the pressure against artery walls [209].
Low blood pressure (hypotension) can indicate blood/fluid loss, loss of
vascular tone, or cardiac problems [209]. It is a late sign of shock [210].
High blood pressure (hypertension) can result in rupture or damage
[210].
Blood pressure cuff components: wide upper cuff, inflatable bladder,
bulb pump/valve, pressure gauge [212].
Auscultation is a common way to measure BP [213].
Palpation (feeling) can be used in certain cases (blood pressure by
palp) [214].
Neurologic system focus (for mental status changes, head injury, stupor,
dizziness, drowsiness, syncope) [216]:
Evaluate level of consciousness and orientation using AVPU or
Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) [216]. GCS provides info on mental status
changes [218].
Assess pupils [219]. Normally round, equal size, and adjust to light [219].
Pupil size and reactivity reflect brain status, perfusion, oxygenation,
and condition [220].
Pupils dilate in the absence of light [221].
Unequal pupils (anisocoria) can indicate altered brain function, though
a small population has unequal pupils normally [222].
Use the PEARL mnemonic: Pupils Equal And Round, Regular in size,
and Reactive to Light [222].
Assess neurovascular status with a hands-on assessment [223].
Determine sensory and motor response [223].
Look for bilateral muscle strength and weakness [223].
Complete a thorough sensory assessment [224]. Test for pain sensation
and position [224].
Compare distal and proximal sensory and motor responses side to side
[224].
For trauma situations, perform the DCAP-BTLS assessment on all body
regions [226].
Head, neck, and cervical spine: palpate, check eyes, cheekbones, ears
(look for fluid), maxilla, mandible, mouth (broken teeth, odors) [227].
Chest: look, listen, and feel [227].
Abdomen: palpate for tenderness, rigidity, guarding [228]. Palpate the four
quadrants (left upper/lower, right upper/lower) [228].
Pelvis: inspect for symmetry [229].
Extremities: check for DCAP-BTLS, pulses, motor, and sensory function
[229].
Roll the patient (often onto a backboard) [230]. Inspect the back for DCAPBTLS,
symmetry, open wounds [231]. Palpate the spine from neck to pelvis
for tenderness or deformity [232].

6. Vital Signs and Reassessment
Assessing vital signs is the next area [234]. Use appropriate monitoring devices, but
they don't replace a comprehensive assessment [235].
Monitoring devices:
Pulse oximetry: Evaluates oxygenation effectiveness; measures oxygen
saturation [235]. Patients with difficulty breathing should get oxygen
regardless of pulse ox reading [235].
Capnography: Provides information on patient ventilation, circulation, and
metabolism [236].
Blood glucose/glucometry: Measures blood sugar level [237].
NBP (Non-invasive blood pressure) measurement [237].
reassessment is the very last part [238].
Perform reassessment at regular intervals [238].
Purpose: Identify and treat changes in the patient's condition [238].
Steps in reassessment:
Repeat the primary assessment [238].
Reassess vital signs [238]. Compare baseline vitals to subsequent ones
to look for trends (e.g., BP changes, heart rate changes) [238].
Reassess the chief complaint [238].
Recheck interventions [238].
Document any changes and whether they were positive or negative [239].
Identify and treat the patient's condition [239].
Reassess unstable patients every five minutes [240]. It is a continuous process
[241].
