## Chapter 31: Introduction to Abdominal and Genitourinary Injuries

### Overview
Explains assessment and management of trauma to the abdomen and genitourinary system.

### Learning Objectives
- Recognize signs of abdominal and GU trauma.
- Assess for internal bleeding and shock.
- Provide appropriate field management.

### Key Terms
| Term      | Definition |
|-----------|------------|
| Hematuria | Blood in urine. |
| Peritonitis | Inflammation of abdominal lining. |
| Evisceration | Protrusion of organs. |

### Major Concepts & Guidelines
- Abdominal injuries may not be obviousâ€”monitor for shock.
- GU trauma may cause hematuria, pain, bleeding.
- Evisceration: cover with moist, sterile dressing.

### Procedures / Protocols
- **Abdominal Trauma:**  
  - Monitor for shock, rapid transport.
- **Evisceration:**  
  - Do not reinsert organs, cover, transport.

### Assessment & Clinical Pearls
- Serial assessments for worsening pain.
- Be alert for blood in urine.

### Documentation Standards
- Record injury type, findings, care.

### Case Example
> Blunt abdominal trauma, tachycardia, hypotension. What should EMS consider?

### Quick Reference Table
| Symptom   | Injury      | Action         |
|-----------|------------|----------------|
| Evisceration | Penetrating wound | Moist dressing, transport |

### Review Questions
1. What is hematuria?
2. How is evisceration managed?
3. Why is shock a concern in abdominal trauma?

## Chapter 32: Orthopedic Injuries

### Overview
Covers assessment and management of fractures, dislocations, sprains, and strains.

### Learning Objectives
- Identify types of orthopedic injuries.
- Immobilize injuries as per protocol.
- Recognize complications (bleeding, neurovascular compromise).

### Key Terms
| Term       | Definition |
|------------|------------|
| Fracture   | Broken bone. |
| Dislocation| Bone out of joint. |
| Splint     | Device for immobilization. |

### Major Concepts & Guidelines
- Immobilize above and below injury.
- Assess CMS before and after splinting.
- Control bleeding.

### Procedures / Protocols
- **Splinting:**  
  - Pad, immobilize, reassess CMS.

### Assessment & Clinical Pearls
- Check for pulses, sensation, movement.
- Open fractures need sterile dressing.

### Documentation Standards
- Record CMS, injury type, splinting.

### Case Example
> Suspected femur fracture, severe pain. What is EMS management?

### Quick Reference Table
| Injury   | Complication | Care         |
|----------|--------------|-------------|
| Fracture | Bleeding     | Immobilize, control bleed |

### Review Questions
1. What is CMS?
2. How is a dislocation managed?
3. Why are open fractures a concern?

## Chapter 33: Environmental Emergencies

### Overview
Discusses hypothermia, hyperthermia, drowning, bites, and stings in EMS.

### Learning Objectives
- Assess and treat hypothermia and hyperthermia.
- Manage drowning and submersion injuries.
- Recognize envenomation and allergic reactions.

### Key Terms
| Term         | Definition |
|--------------|------------|
| Hypothermia  | Low body temperature. |
| Hyperthermia | High body temperature. |
| Envenomation | Injection of venom. |

### Major Concepts & Guidelines
- Remove from environment and prevent further exposure.
- Rewarm or cool patient as indicated.
- Monitor for arrhythmias in hypothermia.

### Procedures / Protocols
- **Hypothermia:**  
  - Remove wet clothing, warm slowly.
- **Heat Stroke:**  
  - Cool rapidly, monitor airway.

### Assessment & Clinical Pearls
- Shivering stops in severe hypothermia.
- Drowning may cause hypoxia, cardiac arrest.

### Documentation Standards
- Record environmental factors, interventions, outcomes.

### Case Example
> Elderly patient found outside in cold, shivering. What is EMS management?

### Quick Reference Table
| Condition     | Treatment        | Priority    |
|---------------|------------------|------------|
| Heat stroke   | Rapid cooling    | Airway, transport |

### Review Questions
1. What are complications of hypothermia?
2. How is drowning managed prehospital?
3. What are signs of heat stroke?
