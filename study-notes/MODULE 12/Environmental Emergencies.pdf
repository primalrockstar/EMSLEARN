1. Introduction to Environmental Emergencies
environmental emergencies occur when the body cannot cope with surrounding
factors like temperature and atmospheric pressure . These situations can lead to
medical emergencies . Certain groups are more vulnerable, including children, older
people, those with chronic illnesses, and young adults who overexert themselves .
environmental emergencies often happen alongside other injuries or illnesses .
Examples of these emergencies include heat and cold-related issues, water
emergencies, pressure-related injuries from diving or altitude, and injuries from
lightning strikes and venomous bites/stings .
2. Cold-Related Emergencies: Physiology and Types
When the body or a part of it is exposed to cold, the temperature regulation is
overwhelmed . Cold exposure can injure the hands, feet, ears, nose, or the whole
body .
Mechanism of Heat
Loss
Description
Conduction Transfer of heat by direct contact with a colder object
Convection Transfer of heat to circulating air moving across the
body
Evaporation Conversion of liquid to gas
Radiation Transfer of heat by radiant energy
Respiration Heat loss as warm air is exhaled and cool air is inhaled
hypothermia happens when the body's core temperature falls below 95 degrees .
The body loses its ability to regulate temperature and generate heat . To protect
against heat loss, blood vessels in the skin constrict, causing blue lips or fingertips .
The body shivers to generate heat . If these mechanisms fail, body functions slow,
mental status declines, and vital organs like the heart slow down, which can lead to
death . hypothermia can develop quickly, such as with cold water immersion . It can
occur even when air temperature is not below freezing . Higher risk populations
include homeless individuals, those without home heating, swimmers, geriatric and ill
patients, and patients with specific medical conditions like burns, shock, head injury,
stroke, generalized infections, spinal cord injuries, diabetes, and hypoglycemia .
Local cold injuries are usually confined to exposed body parts . frostnip and
immersion foot (trench foot) occur when parts are very cold but not frozen .
frostbite occurs when tissues are frozen . Severity depends on exposure duration,
temperature, and wind velocity . Factors like wet conditions, inadequate insulation,
restricted circulation, fatigue, poor nutrition, alcohol/drug abuse, hypothermia,
diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and age also play a role . Patients with hypothermia
should be checked for frostbite and other local cold injuries .
frostnip: Cold skin freezes, but deeper tissues are unaffected. It often affects
the ears, nose, and fingers and is usually not painful. Patients may not realize
the injury has occurred.
immersion foot: Occurs after prolonged exposure to cold water. Signs include
pale, cool skin, wrinkled skin (sometimes remaining soft), and loss of feeling in
the injured area.
frostbite: The most serious local cold injury as tissues are frozen. Freezing
causes permanent cell damage, and gangrene may require surgical removal
of dead tissue. Affected parts become inflamed and tender to touch.
Frostbitten parts are often hard and waxy. Blisters and swelling may be
present. In superficial frostbite, only the skin is frozen; in deep frostbite,
deeper tissues are frozen.
3. Assessment and Management of Cold-Related Emergencies
Assessing cold injuries involves noting environmental conditions like wind chill and
wetness . Ensure scene safety, identify hazards, and use standard precautions . In
the primary assessment, form a general impression and perform a rapid scan for life
threats . Quickly assess core temperature if the chief complaint is coldness . Evaluate
mental status using AVPU .
Stages of
Hypothermia
Core
Temperature
(Fahrenheit)
Signs and Symptoms
Mild > 93.2 but < 98 Alert, shivering, rapid pulse/respirations,
skin red/pale/cyanotic
Moderate 86 to 93.2 Shivering stops, decreased muscle activity,
deteriorating mental status
Severe < 86 Lethargic, stops fighting cold, stiff/rigid
appearance
Core Temp < 80 < 80 Pulse slows/weakens, respirations
slow/absent, cardiac dysrhythmias
possible, pupillary action slow, may appear
dead
If cardiac arrest is suspected, begin chest compressions . Ensure an adequate airway
and breathing; assist with BVM if breathing is slow or shallow . Warm, humidified
oxygen helps rewarm the patient internally . Palpate for the carotid pulse for up to 60
seconds . CPR is recommended for patients with no detectable pulse or breathing .
Perfusion may be compromised, and bleeding may be hard to find . All hypothermic
patients require immediate transport due to complications like cardiac dysrhythmias
and blood clotting issues . Handle patients gently to avoid causing a cold heart to
fibrillate . If transport is delayed, protect the patient from further heat loss .
History taking includes investigating the chief complaint and obtaining medical
history . Note the duration of exposure, medications, and underlying medical
problems . Secondary assessment involves focusing on hypothermia severity and
affected areas . Pay attention to skin temperature, texture, and turgor . Vital signs
indicate severity . Slow, shallow respirations can cause low oxygen . Low blood
pressure and slow pulse may indicate moderate to severe hypothermia . Evaluate
mental status using AVPU . Use a hypothermia thermometer based on local protocol .
Reassessment involves repeating the primary assessment, checking vitals and chief
complaint, and monitoring consciousness and vital signs . Rewarming can cause
cardiac dysrhythmias .
Management of cold emergencies starts with moving the patient from the cold
environment . Remove wet clothing and cover the patient with dry blankets . Provide
warm, humidified oxygen if available . Handle gently; do not massage extremities . Do
not allow the patient to eat or use stimulants .
Mild hypothermia: Passive rewarming is appropriate. Place the patient in a
warm environment and remove wet clothing. Apply heat packs/hot water
bottles to groin, axillary, and cervical regions. Increase ambulance
compartment heat. Give warm fluids by mouth if the patient can swallow.
Moderate/Severe hypothermia: Do not actively rewarm. Rewarming can
cause fatal cardiac dysrhythmias. The goal is to prevent further heat loss.
Remove the patient immediately from the cold and remove wet clothing.
Cover with blankets and transport. Handle very gently to decrease ventricular
fibrillation risk. If unable to move immediately, shelter the patient from wind
and contact with cold objects. Cover with blankets and a waterproof cover,
including the head and neck.
Emergency care for local cold injuries includes removing the patient from the cold .
Handle the injured part gently and protect it . Remove wet or restrictive clothing .
Consider active rewarming if there is no risk of re-injury or if transport is significantly
delayed, and if local protocols allow . Consult medical control .
frostnip: Contact with a warm object may be sufficient.
immersion foot: Remove wet footwear, gradually rewarm the foot, and
protect it from further cold. Cover loosely with a dry sterile dressing. Never
rub or massage injured tissues as this can cause more damage. Do not reexpose
the injury to cold.
frostbite: Remove clothing from the injured part. Cover loosely with a dry
sterile dressing. Do not break blisters or rub the area. Do not apply heat or
rewarm the part. Do not allow the patient to stand or walk on a frostbitten
foot. If hospital care is delayed and medical control advises field rewarming,
use a warm water bath immersion at 102-104 degrees. Dress the area with a
sterile dry dressing, including between injured fingers/toes. Expect severe
pain. Never attempt rewarming if there is any chance the part might freeze
again.
4. Heat-Related Emergencies: Physiology and Types
In hot environments or during vigorous activity, the body tries to eliminate heat
through sweating and dilation of blood vessels . Removing clothing and moving to a
cooler environment also helps . hyperthermia is a core temperature at or above 101
degrees Fahrenheit .
Risk Factors for Heat Illness
High air temperature reduces radiation
High humidity reduces evaporation
Lack of acclimation to heat
Vigorous exercise causes fluid and electrolyte loss
Children, especially newborns and infants
Geriatric patients
Patients with heart disease, COPD, diabetes, dehydration, obesity, or limited
mobility
Alcohol and certain drugs cause dehydration and decrease sweating
There are three forms of heat emergencies: heat cramps, heat exhaustion, and
heat stroke . All three can be present in the same patient . High-risk individuals are
similar to those at risk for cold illnesses .
Heat Cramps: Painful muscle spasms occurring after vigorous exercise. They
don't only occur when it's hot. The exact cause is unclear. They occasionally
occur in leg or abdominal muscles.
heat exhaustion (Heat Collapse): Caused by hypovolemia from losing water
and electrolytes through heavy sweating. High humidity and exertion in poorly
ventilated areas contribute. Signs and symptoms include dizziness,
weakness, fainting, nausea, vomiting, headache, cold clammy skin with ashen
pallor, dry tongue, and thirst. Vital signs are usually normal, pulse may be
rapid and weak, and body temperature is normal or slightly elevated (up to
104°F).
heat stroke: The least common but most serious heat emergency. It happens
when the body is subjected to more heat than it can handle, and normal
cooling mechanisms are overwhelmed. Untreated heat stroke is always fatal.
Typical situations include vigorous activity outdoors, poorly ventilated hot
indoor spaces, heat waves without air conditioning, and children left in hot
locked cars. Signs and symptoms include hot, dry, or flushed skin (sweating
may still occur). There is a rapid rise in body temperature (up to 106°F).
Changes in behavior, unresponsiveness, seizures, rapid weak pulse, increased
respiratory rate, and cessation of perspiration can occur.
5. Assessment and Management of Heat-Related Emergencies
Scene size-up for heat emergencies involves an environmental assessment . A heat
emergency might be secondary to a medical or trauma emergency . Consider calling
advanced life support for unconscious patients, altered mental status, or those
needing IV fluids . Look for mechanism of injury indicators, protect yourself from
heat/biological hazards, stay hydrated, and use standard precautions .
Signs and Symptoms

seizures
Pulse Normal Rapid, weak Rapid, weak
(becomes weaker)
Respirations Normal Normal Increased
Perspiration Yes Yes (heavy) May stop
Primary assessment starts with a general impression and observing patient
interaction . Assess mental status using AVPU . Ensure a patent airway in responsive
patients; position unresponsive patients to protect the airway . Insert an oral airway
and provide BVM ventilations for unresponsive patients . Assess perfusion and
bleeding . Assess skin condition and treat for shock by removing from heat and
positioning . If bleeding, manage according to protocol . Transport rapidly for heat
stroke signs .
History taking includes investigating the chief complaint, obtaining medical history,
and noting factors predisposing to dehydration or heat problems . Determine
heat/humidity exposure and activities before symptom onset . Secondary
assessment involves a full body exam for unresponsive patients or a focused exam
for conscious patients . Assess for muscle cramps, confusion, mental status, and vital
signs . Pay attention to skin temperature, turgor, and moisture . Perform a careful
neurologic exam . Vital signs may be altered; hyperthermic patients may be
tachycardic and tachypneic . Falling blood pressure indicates shock . Skin
temperature can be normal/cold/clammy in heat exhaustion and hot in heat stroke .
Check temperature with a thermometer and pulse oximetry .
Reassessment involves repeating the primary assessment and watching for
deterioration . Transport heat stroke patients immediately in a cool ambulance .
Passively cool by removing clothing and actively cool by spraying water and fanning .
Monitor vital signs every five minutes and evaluate interventions . Avoid overcooling .
Notify the receiving facility early about a heat stroke patient . Document
environmental conditions and prior activities .
Management of heat emergencies:
Heat Cramps: Remove the patient from the hot environment and loosen
clothing. Administer high-flow oxygen. Have the patient sit or lie down until
cramps subside. Replace fluids by mouth. Cool the patient with water
spray/mist and fan. Activity can resume when cramps are gone. Hydration by
drinking water is the best prevention and treatment. Transport if cramps
persist.
heat exhaustion: Treat according to specific steps (skill drill 33-1).
heat stroke: Recovery depends on treatment speed. The objective is to lower
body temperature by any means. Move the patient out of the hot environment
and into the ambulance. Set AC to maximum cooling and remove clothing.
Administer high-flow O2 and assist ventilations if needed. Provide cold water
immersion if possible. Spray with cool water and fan aggressively to
evaporate moisture. Exclude other causes of altered mental status and check
blood glucose if possible. Transport immediately and notify the hospital. Do
not overcool. Call for advanced life support if the patient shivers.
6. Water-Related Emergencies: Drowning and Diving
Drowning is respiratory impairment from submersion or immersion in liquid . Risk
factors include alcohol, seizure disorders, geriatric patients with cardiovascular
disease, and unsupervised access to water for children . Drowning often follows
panic in the water, leading to fatigue and sinking . It can happen in shallow water . A
laryngospasm (spasm of larynx and vocal cords) may occur, meant to prevent water
from entering the lungs . Severe cases lead to progressive hypoxia and
unconsciousness .
Spinal injuries in submersion incidents should be suspected if the submersion
resulted from a diving mishap or fall, the patient is unconscious with no information to
rule out neck injury, or the conscious patient complains of weakness, paralysis, or
numbness in arms/legs . Most spinal injuries in diving incidents affect the cervical
spine . Stabilize suspected injuries while the patient is still in the water .
Diving emergencies can be serious, occurring with or without gear . They are
categorized into descent, bottom, and ascent emergencies .
Descent Emergencies: Caused by increased pressure as a person dives
deeper. Commonly affected areas are lungs, sinus cavities, middle ear, teeth,
and area under the mask. Pain ("squeeze problems") usually forces divers to
return to the surface to equalize pressure. Pain persisting after returning to
the surface, especially in the ear, requires transport as a ruptured eardrum
may have occurred. Cold water entering the middle ear through a ruptured
eardrum can cause loss of balance and orientation. The diver may shoot to
the surface, leading to ascent problems.
Bottom Emergencies: Rarely occur and are usually due to faulty gear
connections or accidental carbon monoxide in the air supply. They can cause
drowning or necessitate rapid ascent.
Ascent Emergencies: The most serious and often require aggressive
resuscitation.
Air Embolism: The most dangerous and common scuba diving
emergency. Air bubbles enter blood vessels. It happens when a diver
holds their breath during rapid ascent. Air pressure in the lungs stays high
while external pressure decreases, causing alveoli to rupture, potentially
leading to pneumothorax or air embolism. Signs and symptoms include
blotching of the skin, froth at the nose/mouth, severe pain in
muscles/joints/abdomen, dyspnea/chest pain, dizziness, nausea, vomiting,
difficulty speaking, cough, cyanosis, vision problems, paralysis/coma,
irregular pulse, and cardiac arrest.
Decompression Sickness (The Bends): Gas bubbles (especially nitrogen)
obstruct blood vessels. It results from rapid ascent, diving too long/deep,
or repeated dives. Nitrogen breathed dissolves in blood and tissues.
Complications include blockage of tiny blood vessels, depriving parts of
the body of blood supply, and severe pain in tissues/spaces. Signs include
abnormal joint pain causing the patient to "double up". Distinguishing
between air embolism and decompression sickness can be difficult. Air
embolism usually occurs immediately upon reaching the surface, while
decompression sickness signs may appear hours later. Emergency
treatment for both involves basic life support and recompression in a
hyperbaric chamber.
7. Assessment and Management of Water-Related Emergencies
Assessment of diving and drowning emergencies begins with scene size-up and
safety . Use standard precautions like gloves and eye protection . Never attempt a
water rescue without proper training and equipment . Call for additional resources
early . Consider trauma and spinal immobilization .
Assessment Steps for Water Emergencies
Scene Size-Up: Scene safety, standard precautions, call for additional resources,
consider trauma/spinal immobilization, look for mechanism of injury indicators
Primary Assessment: Form general impression, assess chest pain, dyspnea,
sensory changes (diving emergency), determine level of consciousness (AVPU),
be suspicious of drug/alcohol use
Airway and Breathing: Open airway, assess breathing, consider spinal trauma,
suction vomit, provide BVM ventilations if inadequate, high-flow oxygen for
responsive patients, auscultate breath sounds
Circulation: Difficult to find pulse, begin CPR/AED, evaluate for shock/perfusion,
assess for bleeding if trauma suspected
Transport Decision: Always transport to hospital, inhalation of any fluid can cause
delayed complications, decompression sickness/air emboli need recompression
chamber
History Taking: Investigate chief complaint, medical history, injury-specific
signs/symptoms, pertinent negatives, depth/duration/time of dive, previous diving
activity
Secondary Assessment: Examine lungs/breath sounds (responsive), look for
hidden life threats/trauma (unresponsive), check for decompression sickness/air
emboli, signs of hypothermia, peripheral pulses, skin
color/discoloration/itching/pain/paresthesia
Vital Signs: Check pulse rate/rhythm/quality (peripheral and central), listen for
heartbeat, check respiratory rate/quality/rhythm, listen for lung sounds, assess
pupil size/reactivity, oxygen saturation (may be false low)
Reassessment: Repeat primary, monitor for deterioration, assess mental
status/vitals every 5 minutes, document circumstances (submersion time, water
temp/clarity, spinal injury possibility), bring dive equipment to hospital
Emergency care for drowning or diving emergencies starts with rescue and removal
from water . Immobilize and protect the spine if a fall or diving injury is suspected .
Artificial ventilation should begin as soon as possible, even before leaving the water .
Remove vomit from the airway . Assist ventilations with BVM or pocket mask .
Provide chest compressions and use the AED if in cardiac arrest . Administer oxygen
if the patient is breathing spontaneously . Treat for hypothermia .
For conscious patients suspected of air embolism or decompression sickness:
Remove from water and keep calm . Administer oxygen and consider pneumothorax .
Monitor breath sounds . Provide prompt transport to the emergency department or
nearest recompression facility . Treat hypothermia from cold water immersion the
same way as hypothermia from cold exposure . Breath-holding syncope in shallow
water can lead to loss of consciousness due to decreased stimulus for breathing and
results in drowning . Treatment is the same as for a drowning patient .
Prevention is key . Pools should be fenced, and lack of adult supervision is a
common cause of child drownings . Alcohol is associated with half of teenage and
adult drownings .
8. High Altitude Sickness
Dysbarism injuries are caused by differences between atmospheric pressure and
gas pressure in body tissues, fluids, and cavities . Altitude sickness occurs when
unacclimated people are exposed to diminished oxygen pressure at high altitudes .
Illnesses affect the central nervous and pulmonary systems . They range from acute
mountain sickness to high altitude cerebral edema (HACE) and high altitude
pulmonary edema (HAPE) .
Acute Mountain Sickness: Can occur above 5,000 feet due to diminished
oxygen pressure and hypoxia. It results from ascending too high, too fast, or
not being acclimated. Signs and symptoms include headache, lightheadedness,
fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, difficulty sleeping, shortness of
breath during exertion, and possibly a swollen face. Treatment is stopping the
ascent and descending.
High Altitude Pulmonary Edema (HAPE): Can happen above 8,000 feet.
Fluid collects in the lungs, hindering oxygen passage into the bloodstream.
Signs and symptoms include shortness of breath, a cough with pink sputum,
cyanosis, and rapid pulse.
High Altitude Cerebral Edema (HACE): Can happen above 12,000 feet and
may accompany HAPE. It can quickly become life-threatening. Signs and
symptoms include a severe, constant, throbbing headache, lack of muscle
coordination and balance, extreme fatigue, vomiting, and loss of
consciousness.
Treatment for HAPE and HACE involves descending to a lower altitude, providing
oxygen, and rapid transport . Provide positive pressure ventilation with a BVM for
inadequate respirations . CPAP may help patients with respiratory distress from HAPE
.
9. Lightning Strikes
An estimated 25 million cloud-to-ground lightning strikes occur annually in the US .
Lightning is the fifth most common cause of death from isolated environmental
phenomena . Direct strikes target those in outdoor activities or large open areas .
Many are indirectly struck near a struck object . The cardiovascular and nervous
systems are most commonly injured . Respiratory and cardiac arrest are the most
common causes of lightning-related deaths . Tissue damage usually occurs over the
skin as the strike duration is short . Skin burns are typically superficial .
Categories of
Lightning Strikes
Characteristics
Mild Loss of consciousness, amnesia, confusion, tingling,
non-specific signs, superficial burns
Moderate Seizures, respiratory arrest, dysrhythmias (resolve
spontaneously), superficial burns
Severe Cardiopulmonary arrest
Emergency care and treatment: Protect yourself from being struck . Move the patient
to a sheltered area . Use reverse triage: prioritize anyone in cardiac or respiratory
arrest first . Stabilize the spine and open the airway with a jaw thrust . If pulses are
present, assist ventilation . If in cardiac arrest, use the AED as soon as possible .
Control bleeding and transport . Patients with signs/symptoms but no obvious life
threats should be transported for evaluation .
10. Bites and Envenomations: Spiders and Insects
In the US, only the female black widow and the brown recluse spider deliver
serious, life-threatening bites .
Characteristics of
Venomous Spiders
in the US
Black Widow Brown Recluse
Size ~2 inches (legs
extended)
~1 inch long
Color Usually black Dull brown
Markings Bright red/orange
hourglass on belly
Violin-shaped mark (brown to
yellow) on back
Habitat Dry, dim places around
buildings, wood piles,
debris

Dizziness, sweating,
nausea, vomiting, rashes,
chest tightness, difficulty
breathing, severe
cramps. Usually subside
in 48 hours.
Rarely cause systemic
symptoms.
Antivenom Available, reserved for
severe bites due to side
effects
Not mentioned as a common
treatment
High-Risk Groups Older people, children <
5
Not specified as distinctly
different from general
population
Emergency Care BLS for respiratory
distress, rapid transport,
bring spider if possible
BLS, rapid transport, bring
spider if possible
Stings from bees, wasps, yellow jackets, and ants are usually painful but not a
medical emergency . Remove the stinger and venom sac by scraping with a firm
edge . Use ice packs for pain control . Anaphylaxis can occur if the patient is allergic .
Signs of anaphylaxis include flushed skin, low blood pressure, difficulty breathing,
wheezes, hives, or swelling of the throat/tongue . Be prepared to assist with an
EpiPen auto-injector and support airway/breathing .
11. Bites and Envenomations: Snakes and Scorpions
Snake bite fatalities in the US are rare, about 15 per year . Only 19 of approximately
115 native US species are venomous . Venomous species include rattlesnakes,
copperheads, cottonmouths (pit vipers), and coral snakes . Snakes usually bite when
provoked or accidentally injured, except for the aggressive cottonmouths . Protect
yourself with caution and proper gear . One-third of bites from venomous snakes
don't result in significant injury . Venomous snakes have hollow fangs that inject
poison . Poisonous snake bites typically leave two small puncture wounds with
discoloration, swelling, and pain . Non-venomous snakes leave a horseshoe of tooth
marks . Fang marks indicate a poisonous bite .
Pit Vipers: Include rattlesnakes, copperheads, and cottonmouths. They have
triangular, flat heads and heat-sensing pits near their nostrils. Fangs are
hollow teeth connected to venom sacs.
Rattlesnakes: Most common pit viper, often with diamond patterns, can
grow large.
Copperheads: Two to three feet long, red copper color with brown/red
bands. Inhabit wood piles and abandoned dwellings. Account for most
venomous bites in the eastern US. Bites are rarely fatal but venom causes
significant tissue damage in extremities.
Cottonmouths (Water Moccasins): About four feet long, olive brown with
black bands. Aggressive water snakes. Fatalities are rare, but tissue
destruction can be severe.
Signs of Pit Viper Envenomation: Severe burning at the site followed by
swelling and blue discoloration (ecchymosis) within 5-10 minutes,
spreading over 36 hours. Venom interferes with clotting, causing bleeding
at distant sites. Other symptoms may include weakness, nausea, vomiting,
sweating, fevers, fainting, vision problems, altered consciousness, and
shock if swelling occurs. Mark the edges of swelling with a pen.
Treatment for Pit Viper Bites: Calm the patient and place in a supine
position. Clean the bite area. Apply ice. Consider pressure immobilization
bandage on an arm/leg. Keep the affected extremity below the heart. Be
alert for anaphylaxis and treat with Epi auto-injector if appropriate. Do not
give anything by mouth. Be alert for vomiting. If bitten on the trunk, keep
supine and quiet, transport quickly. Monitor vital signs and mark swelling
progression. Treat for shock if signs appear. Bring the killed snake or a
photo. Notify the hospital and describe the snake. Transport appropriately.
If no envenomation signs, perform BLS, apply a sterile dressing, and
immobilize the site. All suspected snake bite patients should go to the ED.
Treat the wound like a deep puncture to prevent infection.
Coral Snakes: Small reptiles with bright red, yellow, and black bands around
the body. "Red on yellow will kill a fellow, red on black, venom will lack" helps
identify venomous coral snakes. They inject venom by chewing, leaving
puncture or scratch wounds. Due to small mouth/teeth, they usually bite small
areas like fingers/toes. Venom is a powerful neurotoxin causing nervous
system paralysis. Within hours, bizarre behavior and progressive paralysis of
eye movements and respiration can occur. Successful treatment relies on
snake identification and respiratory support. Antivenom is available but not
widely stocked. Emergency care is the same as for a pit viper bite.
Scorpions are arachnids with a venom gland and stinger . They are rare in the US,
mostly in the Southwest deserts . With one exception, stings are painful but not
dangerous, causing localized swelling/discoloration . A specific type of scorpion's
venom can cause severe systemic reactions: circulatory collapse, severe muscle
contractions, excessive salivation, hypertension, convulsions, and cardiac failure .
Notify medical control, administer BLS, and transport rapidly if this type of sting is
suspected .
12. Bites and Envenomations: Ticks and Marine Animals
Ticks are tiny insects that attach to the skin . Found in brush, shrubs, trees, sand
dunes, and on animals . Bites are not painful, but infectious diseases can spread
through tick saliva .
Diseases
Transmitted by
Ticks
Characteristics
Rocky Mountain
spotted fever
Occurs 7-10 days after bite. Symptoms: nausea, vomiting,
headache, weakness, paralysis, cardiorespiratory collapse.
Lyme disease Reported across the US except Hawaii. First symptoms: fever,
flu-like symptoms, bull's-eye rash spreading over days/weeks.
Painful joint swelling (especially knees) can occur and may
cause permanent disability if untreated. Responds to prompt
antibiotic treatment. Most common in summer.
Provide supportive care and transport . If access to care is delayed, remove the tick
by grasping the head with fine tweezers and pulling straight out . Clean the area with
antiseptic and save the tick for identification . Do not handle the tick with fingers .
Patients should follow up with a healthcare provider .
Marine animal envenomations are common . Stinging cells (nematocysts) are found
in fire coral, Portuguese man-of-war, sea wasps, sea nettles, true jellyfish, sea
anemones, and coral . Signs and symptoms include painful red lesions, lesions
extending in a line, headache, dizziness, muscle cramps, and fainting . Treatment:
Remove from water . Scrape off tentacles with a stiff object like a credit card . Do not
manipulate remaining tentacles . Treat for anaphylactic shock if a systemic allergic
reaction occurs . Give BLS and transport immediately .
Toxins from spines of sea urchins, stingrays, and spiny fish (lionfish, scorpion fish,
stone fish) are heat sensitive . Treatment: Immobilize the affected area and soak in
hot water for 30 minutes . Transport the patient . Be familiar with local marine life if
working near the ocean .
General emergency treatment for marine envenomations: Limit further discharge by
avoiding fresh water, wet sand, showers, or careless handling . Keep the patient calm
and reduce motion of the affected extremity . Remove remaining tentacles by
scraping . Immersion in vinegar may help alleviate symptoms . Provide transport to
the emergency department .
13. Conclusion and Review
This chapter covered environmental emergencies, including cold exposure,
hypothermia, frostbite, heat emergencies, drowning, diving emergencies, and
lightning strikes . Review questions help reinforce understanding of heat loss
mechanisms, indicators of hypothermia, rewarming techniques, treatment for local
cold injuries, management of heat emergencies, and recognizing diving-related
conditions . The concept of reverse triage in lightning strikes is also reviewed,
prioritizing those in cardiac arrest . Understanding these environmental emergencies
and their appropriate management is crucial .
