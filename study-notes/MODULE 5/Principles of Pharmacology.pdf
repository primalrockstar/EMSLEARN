1. Introduction to Pharmacology and Medication Safety
Medications are a critical tool for EMTs. [3]
Appropriate use can alleviate pain and improve a patient's condition. [3]
However, unsafe administration can lead to serious consequences, including
death. [3]
Understanding general pharmacology is significant. [2]
EMTs must identify, describe, and demonstrate the steps for assisting with or
administering medications. [2]
2. Key Medical Definitions in Pharmacology
Term Definition Source
Pharmacology The science of drugs, including their
ingredients, preparation, uses, and actions on
the body.
[4]
Medication A substance used to treat or prevent disease
or relieve pain.
[4]
Pharmacodynamics The process by which the medication works
on the body.
[5]
Pharmacokinetics The actions of the body upon the medication.
[9]
Agonist A medication that causes stimulation of
receptors.
[6]
Antagonist A medication that binds to the receptor or
blocks other medications or chemicals from
attaching.
[6]
Dose The amount of medication given, depending
on patient's weight, age, or desired action.
[7]
Action The therapeutic effect a medication is
expected to have on the body.
[8]
Onset The time from medication administration until
clinical effects occur.
[10]
Duration The length of time that the clinical effects
persist.
[10]
Elimination How medications and chemicals are removed
from the body.
[10]
Peak The point or period when the maximum clinical
effect is achieved.
[10]
3. Factors Affecting Medication Action and Contraindications
How a medication works depends on its route of administration and shock
states. [11]
indications are the reasons or conditions for giving a medication. [12]
Contraindications are situations where a medication would harm or have no
positive effect. [12]
There are two types of contraindications. [12]
Absolute contraindications mean the medication should never be given if
the contraindication is present. [13]
An example is a complete allergy causing anaphylaxis. [14]
Relative contraindications are situations where the benefits may
outweigh the risks. [14]
An example might be a medication causing nausea. [15]
4. Adverse Effects and Medication Names
adverse effects are any actions of a medication other than the desired ones.
[16]
There are different types of adverse effects. [17]
Unintended effects are undesirable but pose little risk to the patient. [17]
Untoward effects are those that can be harmful to the patient. [17]
Medications have different names. [18]
The generic name is a simple, non-proprietary name, not capitalized. [19]
An example is ibuprofen. [20]
The trade name is a brand name given by the manufacturer and begins
with a capital letter. [21]
One drug may have multiple trade names, such as Tylenol. [21]
5. Types of Drugs and Routes of Administration
Prescription drugs require a physician's order and are distributed by
pharmacists. [22]
Over-the-counter (OTC) drugs can be purchased without a prescription. [22]
Other drug types include recreational drugs (heroin, cocaine), herbal
remedies, enhanced drugs, vitamin supplements, and alternative
medicines. [23]
Any medicine a patient takes can be pharmacologically active and cause an
effect. [23]
EMTs should ask patients about all medications and drugs they are taking. [23]
Routes of administration can be categorized as internal or parenteral. [24]
Internal medications enter through the digestive system, often as pills or
liquids. [25]
They tend to absorb slowly and are not commonly used in emergency
settings. [26]
Parenteral medications enter the body by other means, often liquids
administered through needles or syringes. [26]
They are absorbed more quickly and offer a more predictable response.
[26]
absorption is the process of medications traveling through body tissues into
the bloodstream. [27]

6. Medication Forms and Administration Steps
The form of the medication often dictates the route of administration. [41]
Manufacturers choose forms for proper route, timing of release, and effects.
[41]
Common medication forms include:
Tablets and capsules: Most medications given by mouth. [42] Capsules
are gelatin shells; tablets are compressed with other materials. [43]
Solutions and suspensions: Liquid mixtures. Solutions are liquid mixtures
that cannot be easily separated and can be given by almost any route. [44]
Suspensions are mixtures of particles that separate and must be shaken
before administration. [47]
Metered-dose inhalers: Liquids or solids broken into fine droplets or
particles for inhalation, delivering a set amount each time. [48]
Topical medications: Lotions, creams, and ointments applied to the skin
surface to affect only that area. [49] Examples: hydrocortisone cream,
Neosporin, calamine lotion. [49]
transcutaneous medications: Applied through the skin for a systemic
effect. [50] EMTs can absorb these if they touch them. [50]
Gels: Semi-liquids administered in capsules or plastic tubes. [51] Oral
glucose for diabetic emergencies is an example. [51]
Gas: One of the most common is oxygen, delivered via non-rebreather or
nasal cannula. [52]
General steps for administering medications:
Administer only under medical direction (online or offline). [53]
Follow the nine rights of medication administration. [53]
7. The Nine Rights of Medication Administration
Right Description Source
Right Patient Ensure the correct patient receives the
medication.
[54]
Right Medication Verify the proper medication and
prescription.
[54]
Right Indication Verify the proper indication for the
medication.
[54]
Right Dose Verify the form and dose of the medication.
[55]
Right Route Verify the route of the medication.
[55]
Right Time Check the expiration date and condition of
the medicine.
[56]
Right Education Inform the patient about the medication,
including likely adverse effects or unusual
sensations.
[57]
Right to Refuse A patient with decision-making capacity
can decline interventions or medication.
[58]
Right
Response/Evaluation
Monitor vital signs, mental status,
perfusion, and respiratory effort; assess for
anticipated response and adverse effects.
[58]
Right Documentation Document your actions and the patient's
response.
[60]
8. Types of Medication Administration by EMTs
EMTs have increasing responsibility with medications. [62]
Many departments have strict guidelines on when EMTs can administer
medication. [62]
There are three ways EMTs may be allowed to administer medication:
Peer-assisted medication: Administering medication to yourself or your
partner, such as after exposure to a toxic agent. [63]
Patient-assisted medication: Assisting the patient with administering
their own medication. [63] Examples include an Epi autoinjector, nitro, or a
metered dose inhaler. [63]
EMT administration of medication: The EMT directly administers the
medication to the patient, often when the patient is confused or unable to
understand. [64] Examples include oxygen, oral glucose, and aspirin. [65]
Medical control, state guidelines, and local protocols determine what EMTs
can administer. [66]
9. Specific Oral Medications Administered by EMTs
Administering oral medications involves specific steps. [68]
Take standard precautions. [69]
Confirm the medication has not expired. [69]
Obtain medical direction per local protocol. [69]
Confirm the patient has a patent airway and can swallow or chew. [70]
Monitor the patient's condition and document. [71]
Oral Glucose:
A sugar used by cells for energy, necessary for brain cells. [72]
Counters effects of hypoglycemia (extremely low glucose). [72]
EMTs can give glucose only by mouth in gel form. [73]
Never administer to an unconscious patient or one unable to swallow or
protect their airway. [73]
Aspirin:
Reduces fever, pain, and inflammation. [75]
In the pre-hospital field, given to inhibit platelet aggregation, useful
during a potential heart attack. [75]
Contraindications: hypersensitivity to aspirin, pre-existing liver damage,
bleeding disorder, or asthma. [76]
Should not be given to children. [76]
10. Sublingual Medications: Nitroglycerin
sublingual administration (under the tongue) has considerations. [77]
Advantages: Easy to talk with awake patients and advise them to place
the pill; absorption rates are relatively quick. [78]
Disadvantages: Requires consent and constant airway evaluation; should
not be used if the patient is uncooperative or unconscious. [80]
Nitroglycerin (Nitro) is a common sublingual medication used by cardiac
patients to relieve angina pain. [81]
Increases blood flow by relieving spasm and causing arteries to dilate. [82]
Relaxes veins throughout the body, decreasing blood return to the heart
and reducing workload. [83]
Will decrease blood pressure. [83]
Must check blood pressure before administering. [84]
Obtain orders or follow local protocols. [84]
Can have fatal interactions with erectile dysfunction medication (Viagra,
Cialis, Levitra) taken within the last 24 hours, as these are also
vasodilators. [85]
Can be administered by metered dose spray or tablet. [88]
Tablet: Place under the tongue to dissolve; patient may feel a tingling
or burning sensation. [89] Store in original glass container with tight
cap. [90]
Spray: Deposit medication under the tongue; one spray equals one
tablet. [91]
Administration considerations:
Wait five minutes before repeating the dose and waiting for a
response. [92]
Closely monitor vital signs, especially blood pressure. [93]
Give repeated doses per medical control or local protocol. [93]
Always wear gloves as the medication can be absorbed by your skin.
[94]
Reconfirm the medication is still indicated and understand local
protocols. [94]
11. Intramuscular Medications: Epinephrine and Naloxone
intramuscular (im) administration has considerations. [96]
Advantages: Quick and easy access to the circulatory system without a
vein needle; blood flow to muscles is relatively stable. [97]
Disadvantages: Requires using a needle and involves some pain. [98]
Epinephrine (Epi), also known as adrenaline, is an IM medication. [98]
Released naturally by adrenal glands during stress. [99]
Controls the body's fight-or-flight response. [99]
Dilates passages in the lungs, constricts blood vessels, and increases
heart rate and blood pressure. [100]
Should only be given for life-threatening allergic reactions. [101]
Often dispensed via an auto-injector, which delivers a pre-set amount
(usually 0.3 mg). [101]
Some services allow EMTs to assist patients in administering their own Epi.
[102]
Naloxone (Narcan) is another IM medication used to reverse opiate overdose
effects. [103]
Can be administered by family members or caregivers. [103]
Can also be administered via the intranasal route. [102]
Considerations:
Follow local protocol. [103]
Determine if naloxone was given by a bystander. [103]
Effects may not last as long as opiates, so repeated doses may be
needed. [104]
Giving naloxone to opiate-dependent patients can cause severe
withdrawal symptoms, including seizures and cardiac arrest. [105]
Consider your personal safety. [105]
If naloxone is not available, bag valve mask ventilation may be required.
[110]
12. Inhaled Medications: Oxygen, MDIs, and Nebulizers
Oxygen is the most commonly administered medication pre-hospital. [111]
Needed by all cells, especially in the heart and brain. [112]
Generally given via non-rebreather mask (10-15 L/min) or nasal cannula
(2-6 L/min). [112]
Artificial ventilations with a BVM (15 L/min) are needed if the patient is not
breathing. [113]
Ensure no open flame, cigarettes, or sparks when administering oxygen.
[113]
metered dose inhalers (MDIs) and nebulizers are used to administer liquid
medications as a fine mist. [114]
Medication is atomized and breathed into the lungs, delivered to the
alveoli. [115]
Advantages: Fast and relatively easy route to access. [115]
Disadvantages: Patient needs to be cooperative and have controlled
breathing; cannot be used for unconscious patients. [116]
MDIs require coordination, which can be difficult during breathing trouble.
[118]
A spacer fits over the MDI, allowing the patient to spray the dose into a
chamber and then inhale the mist, useful for young children. [119]
Small Volume nebulizers (SVNs) are easier to use than MDIs and can be
more effective for moderate to severe respiratory distress. [121]
They take longer to deliver medication and require an external air or
oxygen source. [122]
Can be used while the patient is on CPAP, during BVM ventilation, or
adapted to a non-rebreather mask. [122]
13. Patient Medications and Implications for EMS Providers
Finding out what medications a patient is taking is vital. [124]
Medication history provides clues to the patient's condition and helps guide
treatment. [124]
It is useful for determining chronic or underlying conditions when a patient
cannot provide history. [125]
Ask about prescription and non-prescription drugs (OTC, herbal, illegal). [126]
Transport the medications or a list with the patient to the emergency
department. [125]
Do not underestimate the importance of a thorough medical history. [127]
Consider a patient's medications in the context of the clinical encounter. [128]
Patient medications can significantly alter the clinical presentation of acute
medical problems or injuries. [129]
Examples: beta-adrenergic blocking agents and calcium channel
blockers can slow heart rates. [130]
anti-platelet and anticoagulant medications can cause significant
bleeding from minor injuries like a head bump. [131]
14. Medication Errors and Quality Improvement
A medication error is the inappropriate use of a medication that could lead to
patient harm. [132]
To prevent errors:
Ensure the environment does not contribute, with sufficient lighting and
organized equipment. [133]
Limit distractions as much as possible. [133]
Consider using a cheat sheet for critical administration steps. [133]
If a medication error occurs:
Rapidly provide any appropriate care. [134]
Notify medical control quickly. [135]
Follow local protocols. [136]
Document the incident thoroughly, accurately, and honestly. [136]
Talk with your partner, supervisor, or medical director. [137]
Medication errors are an opportunity to learn and identify areas for quality
improvement. [138]
