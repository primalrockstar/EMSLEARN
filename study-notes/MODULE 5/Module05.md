# Module 5: Principles of Pharmacology for EMS

---

## Chapter 12: Principles of Pharmacology

### Overview
Explains pharmacological principles relevant to EMS, drug classifications, routes of administration, and safe medication practices.

### Learning Objectives
- Understand basic pharmacology concepts and terminology.
- Identify common EMS medications and indications.
- Describe routes of drug administration and safety practices.

### Key Terms
| Term      | Definition |
|-----------|------------|
| Pharmacokinetics | How drugs move through the body. |
| Pharmacodynamics | How drugs affect the body. |
| Contraindication | Reason a drug should not be used. |
| Side Effect | Unintended drug effect. |

### Major Concepts & Guidelines
- Six rights of medication administration: right patient, drug, dose, route, time, documentation.
- Routes: oral, intramuscular, intravenous, subcutaneous, inhalation, sublingual.
- Common EMS meds: oxygen, aspirin, nitroglycerin, epinephrine, glucose, naloxone.

### Procedures / Protocols
- **Medication Administration:**  
  - Verify six rights.
  - Monitor for adverse reactions.

### Assessment & Clinical Pearls
- Always check medication expiration and clarity.
- Reassess patient after administration.

### Documentation Standards
- Record drug name, dose, route, time, and patient response.

### Case Example
> A patient with chest pain is given aspirin. What are the indications and contraindications?

### Quick Reference Table
| Drug         | Indication           | Contraindication |
|--------------|---------------------|------------------|
| Nitroglycerin| Chest pain, angina  | Low BP, ED drugs |

### Review Questions
1. List the six rights of medication administration.
2. What is naloxone used for?
3. Name two routes of drug administration in EMS.
