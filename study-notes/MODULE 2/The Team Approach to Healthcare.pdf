1. Introduction to the Team Approach in Healthcare
The team approach to healthcare is significant. [2]
It impacts positive patient outcomes. [2]
As an EMT, you are a critical member of this team. [4]
The team includes first responders, paramedics, and other EMTs. [5]
It also involves physicians, nurses, and other personnel. [5]
They help the patient throughout their illness or injury. [5]
A key goal is inherently safe EMS systems. [6]
These systems minimize exposure to injury and infection. [6]
The culture of safety involves data collection and resources. [7]
It also includes EMS education and safety standards. [7]
Reporting and investigating errors is part of this culture. [7]
Previous models had providers working separately. [9]
They passed the patient from one individual to the next. [9]
Working as a uniform team improves performance. [10]
This includes first patient contact to discharge. [10]
Patient safety and outcomes are also improved. [10]
2. Types of Healthcare Teams
There are different types of teams. [14]
You have regular teams and temporary teams. [15]
Regular teams consist of EMTs. [16]
They constantly interact with the same partner. [16]
They are more likely to move smoothly through procedures. [17]
Temporary teams work with providers they don't regularly interact with.
[17]
Providers must work collaboratively. [17]
Special teams are another type. [19]
These include fire teams and rescue teams. [19]
Hazmat and tactical teams are examples. [19]
Special event EMS teams and bike teams exist. [19]
In-hospital patient care techs and MIH technicians are included. [19]
There is a difference between groups and teams. [20]
NIMS defines a group by functional level of operation. [21]
Groups perform special functions. [22]
A group consists of independent healthcare providers. [23]
They work independently to help the patient. [23]
Examples are triage, transport, or treatment groups. [23]
A team is a group of providers with specific roles. [24]
They work interdependently under a leader. [24]
Essential elements of a group include a common goal. [24]
They have an image of themselves as a group. [24]
They have a sense of community and shared values. [24]
There are different roles within the group. [24]
There are dependent, independent, and interdependent groups. [25]
In dependent groups, individuals are told what and how to do things. [25]
This is done by their supervisor or leader. [25]
In independent groups, each individual is responsible for their area. [26]
In interdependent groups, everyone works together. [26]
They have shared responsibilities and accountability. [27]
They work towards a common goal. [27]
2. Types of Healthcare Teams
Team Type Characteristics Interaction
Frequency
Regular Teams EMTs work consistently with the same
partner. [16]
Frequent and
consistent. [16]
Temporary
Teams
EMTs work with providers they don't
regularly interact with or know. [17]
Infrequent or initial.
[17]
3. Essential Elements for Effective Team Performance
Effective team performance requires a shared goal. [28]
Every provider must be committed to the goal. [28]
Clear roles and responsibilities are needed. [29]
Each provider must know their tasks and expectations. [29]
A diverse and competent skill set is important. [30]
Team members should practice together. [30]
They should be familiar with each other's tools and techniques. [30]
Effective collaboration and communication are vital. [31]
Team communication includes clear messages. [31]
Closed-loop communication is an element. [31]
Courtesy and constructive intervention are also important. [31]
Supportive and coordinated leadership is necessary. [32]
The team leader assigns roles and provides oversight. [33]
They offer centralized decision making. [33]
Leaders support the team to achieve goals. [33]
Team leaders foster communication and dynamics. [34]
They use concepts like crew resource management (crm). [34]
Team situational awareness is also used. [34]
CRM helps teams develop a shared understanding. [36]
It is a way for team members to work together. [36]
CRM recommends using the pace mnemonic. [36]
PACE stands for Probe, Alert, Challenge, Emergency. [37]
4. Patient Care Transfer and Collaboration
Patient care is transferred at several points. [38]
This transfer is also called handing off care. [38]
These transfers can introduce critical errors. [39]
Errors are possible especially with multiple transfers. [39]
Effective teams minimize the number of transfers. [40]
They adhere to strict guidelines for transfers. [40]
Verbal transfer of care should ensure uninterrupted critical care. [41]
There should be minimal interference. [41]
Respectful interaction is important. [41]
Teams should have common priorities. [41]
Common language systems should be used. [41]
Basic life support efforts must continue. [43]
This continues throughout the continuum of care. [43]
Efforts must be coordinated with advanced life support. [44]
Advanced providers use advanced tools and techniques. [44]
A paramedic-only skill in one system might be an EMT skill in another. [45]
It is your responsibility to understand your scope of practice. [46]
Standard of care and local protocols are also important. [46]
5. Decision Making and Conflict Resolution in Teams
Effective decisions are based on sound knowledge. [48]
Information comes from the patient and history. [48]
Physical examination also provides information. [48]
There are stages in the decision-making process. [49]
These stages include pre-arrival, arrival, during the call, and after the call. [49]
Decision making begins with initial dispatch information. [49]
Mentally rehearse needed care steps. [49]
Designate a leader in the pre-arrival stage. [49]
Crew members discuss their roles. [49]
On arrival, provide a scene size-up. [50]
Request additional resources if needed. [50]
Assess and intervene for life threats immediately. [50]
During the call, the team leader gathers information. [51]
They interpret the data and develop a plan. [51]
The plan is communicated to the team. [51]
The plan is then implemented. [51]
Evaluate the effect of the decision. [51]
After the call, debrief and talk about what happened. [52]
Listen to feedback with an open mind. [53]
There are decision traps in critical thinking. [54]
These traps frequently lead to errors. [55]
decision traps include bias, anchoring, and overconfidence. [55]
biases are fixed beliefs about something. [56]
anchoring occurs when one cause is settled on early. [56]
Other options are then not considered. [56]
overconfidence happens when abilities are overestimated. [56]
When conflict occurs, use five techniques. [57]
The patient comes first. [57]
Do not engage in the conflict. [57]
Keep your cool. [57]
Separate the person from the issue. [57]
Choose your battles wisely. [57]
6. Review of Key Concepts
A characteristic of a regular team is consistent interaction with the same
partner. [59]
This allows them to perform as a seamless unit. [59]
Essential elements of a group include shared goals. [61]
It is important for groups to have a set of shared goals. [61]
Members of an interdependent group work together. [62]
They have shared responsibilities and accountability. [62]
They work towards a common goal. [62]
Repeating a message back to a team member is closed-loop communication.
[64]
A clear message is delivered calmly and concisely. [65]
The listener repeats it back. [65]
A team leader is essential for team success. [66]
When verbal transfer of care occurs, ensure team members are respectful.
[68]
In a conflict scenario with a tired partner, it's suggested to go ahead and
discuss it after. [70]
