with a straight back bent at the
hips [28]
Leg
Placement
Legs spread about 15 inches
apart or shoulder width [28]
Body
Movement
Bend at the legs to lower
upper body [30]
Lifting Action Lift by extending properly
placed flexed legs [32]
Lifting with arms outstretched [34]
Spinal
Alignment
Spinal column remains in
alignment; back locked in
slight curve [25]
Placing lateral force across the
spine and sideways leverage
against the low back [35]
Reaching
Distance
Extend arms no more than
15 to 20 inches [43]
Reaching beyond recommended
distance [46]
Power Grip Palms up, thumbs extend
upward, fingers curled
tightly over handle [37]
Proper body mechanics are essential for safe patient movement [2].
Understanding the relationship between the body's structures and physical
forces is key [25].
Maintaining physical fitness significantly reduces the risk of injuries [20].
When lifting, align your shoulder girdle over your pelvis [26].
Keep your hands close to your legs [26].
This alignment directs force straight down your spinal cord, minimizing strain
[27].
Avoid lifting by leaning forward or bending at the hips with a straight back [28].
Spread your legs about 15 inches apart or shoulder width for proper balance
[28].
Balance your weight on the balls of your feet [29].
Lower your upper body by bending at the legs [30].
The safest and most powerful way to lift is by extending your flexed legs [32].
This technique is known as the power lift [33].
Do not lift with your arms outstretched [34].
Avoid applying sideways force or leverage against your low back [35].
Keep your arms a safe distance apart [36].
Use the power grip for maximum force when lifting with your hands [6].
In a power grip, palms face up and thumbs extend upward [37].
Hands should be about 10 inches apart [37].
Curl fingers and thumb tightly over the handle [37].
Fully support the handle with your curved palm [37].
The same body mechanics principles apply to reaching and pulling [40].
When dragging, keep your back locked in a slight curve [42].
Kneel and extend your arms no more than 15 to 20 inches [43].
Stop pulling when your hands reach the front of your torso [44].
Reposition yourself by moving back another 15 to 20 inches [44].
Alternate between flexing your arms to pull and repositioning [44].
When dragging a patient across a bed, kneel on the bed to avoid
overreaching [46].
Drag the patient to within 15 to 20 inches [47].
Complete the drag while standing at the side of the bed [48].
Use a sheet or blanket rather than dragging clothing [49].
When log rolling, kneel close to the patient [53].
Lean forward from the hips, keeping your back straight [53].
Roll the patient without stopping until they rest on their side against your
thighs [54].
Pulling towards you allows your legs to prevent the patient from rolling too far
[55].

The wheeled ambulance stretcher is the most common device for moving
and transporting patients [7].
It has a strong tubular metal frame [10].
Retractable guard rails prevent patients from rolling off [11].
The undercarriage allows for adjustable height [12].
Hinges allow the head end to be elevated [12].
The mattress is fluid-resistant for easy cleaning [13].
Patients are secured with straps [13].
backboards are long, flat, rigid boards [14].
They are used to carry and immobilize supine patients with suspected spinal
injuries or multiple trauma [15].
backboards can also move patients from awkward places [16].
Holes along the sides serve as handles and allow for securing straps [17].
Moving a patient by rolling on a stretcher is preferred over carrying when
possible [9].
The stair chair is used to carry conscious patients up or down stairs or
inclines [68].
It is a lightweight folding chair with handles and wheels [69].
Specialized equipment exists for different patient needs [63].
Bariatric stretchers are designed for overweight or obese patients [112].
They have a wider surface, wider wheelbase, and increased weight capacity
[113].
Flexible stretchers are useful for moving patients from confined spaces [118].
scoop stretchers split into pieces to fit around the patient [129].
vacuum mattresses are an alternative for immobilizing geriatric and pediatric
patients [123].
They mold to the patient's body [124].
basket stretchers are rigid and used for moving patients over uneven terrain
or during rescues [126].
A neonatal isolette is used to transport infants up to 30 days old [131].
It keeps the infant warm and protected [132].
Portable or folding stretchers are used in hard-to-reach areas [116].
When loading a wheeled stretcher into an ambulance, hold the frame firmly
[78].
Self-loading models have extra wheels for pushing into the ambulance [79].
Non-self-loading models need to be lowered and lifted [80].
Clamps inside the ambulance secure the stretcher [81].
3. Types of Patient Moves
emergency moves are used when there is immediate danger before full
assessment or care [84].
Examples include a scene that is unsafe or the patient's position prevents
immediate care [84].
Techniques aim to prevent aggravation of potential spinal cord injury [85].
Common emergency move techniques include the clothes drag [86].
The blanket drag involves placing the patient on a blanket to be pulled [87].
The arm drag involves grasping the patient's wrists with arms extended above
their head [88].
The arm-to-arm drag involves grasping opposite wrists through the patient's
armpits [88].
Removing an unconscious patient from a vehicle alone requires specific steps
[89].
urgent moves are necessary for patients with conditions like altered level of
consciousness, inadequate ventilation, shock, or in extreme weather [92].
The rapid extrication technique is an urgent move for patients in a vehicle
[93].
This technique is used when urgency exists and the patient must be moved
quickly [93].
It can move a patient from a vehicle to a backboard in about a minute [95].
However, this technique increases the risk of spinal cord injury [95].
Consider all options before using rapid extrication [95].
Non-urgent moves are used when the scene and patient are stable [97].
These moves should be carefully planned [97].
The direct ground lift is for patients found on the ground with no suspected
spinal injury [98].
It is used when the patient needs to be carried a distance to the stretcher [99].
Two EMTs stand side by side to lift and carry the patient [99].
The extremity lift is for patients with no suspected extremity or spinal cord
injury [100].
It is useful in small spaces as it doesn't require standing side by side [101].
One EMT is at the head, the other at the feet [102].
Movements are coordinated with direct verbal commands [102].
Transfer moves include the direct carry and draw sheet method [103].
A direct carry moves a supine patient from a bed to a stretcher with two or
more rescuers [103].
The draw sheet method uses a sheet or blanket to move a patient from bed to
stretcher [104].
Using a scoop stretcher is another transfer method [104].
Other carries include the log roll or slide to move a patient to a backboard [105]
.
Checking airway, breathing, and circulation is the first step if a patient is not in
immediate danger [168].
4. Special Considerations and Patient Positioning
Patient Condition Recommended Position Notes
No suspected injury,
chest pain/respiratory
distress [138]
Position of comfort
(typically Fowler or semi-
Fowler) [138]
Shock [139] Supine position [139]
Late stages of
pregnancy [140]
Transport on their left
side [140]
Position on left side if
uncomfortable or hypotensive
in supine position [141]
Unresponsive, no
suspected injury, hip,
or pelvic injury [142]
Recovery position [142]
Nauseated or
vomiting [142]
Position of comfort [142]
Suspected spinal cord
injury [106]
Consider geriatricspecific
immobilization
devices like vacuum
mattresses [107]
Skeletal changes in older
adults may prevent lying
supine on backboards/scoop
stretchers [106]
Most patients transported by EMS are geriatric patients [106].
Skeletal changes in older people can lead to brittle bones, rigidity, or spinal
curvatures [107].
These changes can make lying supine on a backboard or scoop stretcher
difficult or injurious [107].
Consider using geriatric-specific mobilization devices such as vacuum
mattresses [107].
Bariatric patients (overweight or obese) present unique challenges [108].
Moving bariatric patients takes an increasing toll on EMT health [108].
Back injuries are a major cause of missed workdays for EMTs [109].
Equipment with higher capacity is being developed, but user danger remains
[109].
Special bariatric techniques, equipment, and resources are needed for
patients over 350 pounds [63].
Examples of bariatric equipment include specialized stretchers [112].
Mnemonic or electric-powered stretchers limit the risk of injury [114].
Patients must be properly positioned based on their chief complaint [137].
Patients with chest pain or respiratory distress and no suspected injury
should be placed in a position of comfort, usually Fowler or semi-Fowler [138].
Patients in shock should be placed in the supine position [139].
Late-stage pregnant patients should be transported on their left side [140].
The left-side position is especially important if they are uncomfortable or
hypotensive in the supine position [141].
An unresponsive patient without suspected injury should be placed in the
recovery position [142].
Patients who are nauseated or vomiting should be transported in a position of
comfort [142].
Before using medical restraints, evaluate for correctable causes of
combativeness like head injury or hypoxia [143].
Follow local protocols and obtain medical authorization for restraints [143].
Restraining a patient typically requires a minimum of five people: one for each
extremity and one for the head [144].
One EMT should be the team leader [145].
The patient should be in the supine position [146].
A prone position can lead to asphyxia [146].
Apply a restraint to each extremity [147].
Restrain the patient to a backboard with one arm above the head and the
other by the side [148].
Assess the patient's ABCs, mental status, and circulation after applying
restraints [149].
Document all restraint information [149].
5. Team Coordination and Safety
Team actions must be coordinated when moving patients [82].
A team leader indicates team member positions and describes the steps
before lifting [82].
The team leader uses preparatory commands and countdowns [84].
Carefully plan ahead by selecting methods with the least amount of lifting and
carrying [84].
Consider potential sources of strain during the move [84].
Perform a personal safety assessment before moving a patient [150].
Ask yourself if you are physically strong enough [151].
Assess if there is adequate room for a proper stance [151].
Determine if additional personnel are needed for assistance [151].
Injured EMTs cannot provide help [151].
Equipment decontamination is essential after use [135].
decontamination protects the safety of yourself, the crew, and future patients
[135].
It also prevents the spread of disease [135].
Know and follow local standard operating procedures for disinfecting
equipment [136].
