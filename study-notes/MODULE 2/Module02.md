## Chapter 5: Medical Terminology

### Overview
Introduces common medical terms, abbreviations, prefixes, and suffixes used in EMS for clear communication and documentation.

### Learning Objectives
- Recognize and use common medical prefixes and suffixes.
- Interpret abbreviations used in EMS.
- Apply medical terminology in documentation and communication.

### Key Terms
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Prefix | A word part added to the beginning of a root word. |
| Suffix | A word part added to the end of a root word. |
| Abbreviation | Shortened form of a word or phrase. |

### Major Concepts & Guidelines
- Prefixes indicate location, number, or time.
- Suffixes often denote procedures, conditions, or diseases.
- Proper terminology reduces errors and improves clarity.

### Procedures / Protocols
- Use standard terms when communicating and documenting.
- Avoid slang or non-standard abbreviations.

### Assessment & Clinical Pearls
- Always clarify unknown terms with medical control.
- Double-check abbreviations for accuracy.

### Documentation Standards
- Use universally accepted terms.
- Avoid non-standard or ambiguous words.

### Case Example
> EMT writes "SOB" in report. What does it mean? Why is clarity important?

### Quick Reference Table
| Prefix/Suffix | Meaning | Example |
|---------------|--------|---------|
| Hyper-        | Over   | Hypertension |
| -itis         | Inflammation | Bronchitis |

### Review Questions
1. What does the prefix "hypo-" mean?
2. Give an example of a medical abbreviation used in EMS.
3. Why is standard terminology important?

## Chapter 6: The Human Body

### Overview
Covers anatomy and physiology basics essential to EMS, including major body systems and their functions.

### Learning Objectives
- Identify major organ systems and their functions.
- Describe anatomical positions and planes.
- Relate anatomy knowledge to patient assessment.

### Key Terms
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Anatomy | Study of body structure. |
| Physiology | Study of body function. |
| Homeostasis | Body's ability to maintain balance. |

### Major Concepts & Guidelines
- Body systems: respiratory, cardiovascular, nervous, musculoskeletal, digestive, etc.
- Anatomical positions: supine, prone, lateral, etc.
- Planes: sagittal, coronal, transverse.

### Procedures / Protocols
- Use anatomical landmarks for assessment and interventions.

### Assessment & Clinical Pearls
- Always assess for symmetry and bilateral findings.
- Know organs in each quadrant for abdominal assessment.

### Documentation Standards
- Document findings using anatomical terms.

### Case Example
> Patient has pain in RUQ. What organs are located there?

### Quick Reference Table
| Quadrant | Organs |
|----------|--------|
| RUQ      | Liver, Gallbladder |

### Review Questions
1. What is the function of the respiratory system?
2. Name three organs in the abdominal cavity.
3. Define "homeostasis."

## Chapter 7: Life Span Development

### Overview
Discusses changes in anatomy, physiology, and assessment needs across the life span from neonate to geriatric.

### Learning Objectives
- Compare age-related physiological differences.
- Identify assessment modifications for different age groups.
- Recognize psychosocial factors affecting care.

### Key Terms
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Neonate | Newborn, first 28 days of life. |
| Geriatric | Elderly adult, typically >65 years. |
| Adolescence | Age 12–18 years. |

### Major Concepts & Guidelines
- Vital signs and assessments change with age.
- Communication style and psychosocial needs vary by age group.

### Procedures / Protocols
- Adjust assessment and interventions for age-specific needs.

### Assessment & Clinical Pearls
- Pediatric airway anatomy requires special attention.
- Elderly patients may have atypical presentations.

### Documentation Standards
- Note age-specific findings and interventions.

### Case Example
> Elderly patient presents with confusion. What age-related factors could contribute?

### Quick Reference Table
| Age Group | Normal Pulse | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Neonate   | 100–160      | Fast, irregular |

### Review Questions
1. What are common pediatric airway concerns?
2. Name one psychosocial challenge in adolescence.
3. How does aging affect vital signs?

## Chapter 8: Lifting and Moving Patients

### Overview
Focuses on safe practices for lifting and moving patients, including body mechanics, equipment, and teamwork.

### Learning Objectives
- Use proper lifting techniques to prevent injury.
- Identify equipment used for patient movement.
- Coordinate team movement for safety.

### Key Terms
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Body Mechanics | Use of muscle and posture for safe movement. |
| Stretcher | Device for transporting patients. |
| Log Roll | Maneuver for moving patients to a flat position. |

### Major Concepts & Guidelines
- Use legs, not back, when lifting.
- Always communicate with team before moving.
- Use appropriate equipment for patient size and condition.

### Procedures / Protocols
- **Log Roll:** Maintain spinal alignment.
- **Direct Carry:** Use coordinated movements.

### Assessment & Clinical Pearls
- Assess for spinal injury before movement.
- Secure patient to stretcher before transport.

### Documentation Standards
- Document method and equipment used.

### Case Example
> Patient with suspected spinal injury must be moved. What technique should be used?

### Quick Reference Table
| Technique  | Indication       | Notes        |
|------------|------------------|-------------|
| Log Roll   | Spinal injury    | 3+ providers |

### Review Questions
1. What is the safest way to lift a patient?
2. Name two patient moving devices.
3. Why is team communication important?
