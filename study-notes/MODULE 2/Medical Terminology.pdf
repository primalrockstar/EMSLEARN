1. Introduction to Medical Terminology
Effective communication and documentation in healthcare rely on a strong
knowledge of medical terminology [6].
Understanding medical terms, symbols, and abbreviations is crucial for EMTs
[6].
Knowing medical jargon helps in communicating with EMS, healthcare, and
public safety teams [8].
The purpose of medical terminology is to use foundational and anatomical
terms for communication [2].
You can define unknown words by understanding term formation and
component definitions [7].
Component Description
Word Root Foundation of the word [12]
Prefix Occurs before the word root [14]
Suffix Occurs after the word root [16]
Combining Vowels Vowels that join word roots or other components [17]
2. Anatomy of Medical Terms: Word Roots, Prefixes, and Suffixes
A word root is the main part or stem of a word [25].
It conveys the essential meaning and often indicates a body part [27].
Most terms have at least one word root [28].
A prefix appears at the beginning of a term [32].
prefixes usually describe location or intensity [33].
They give the word root its specific meaning [34].
suffixes are placed at the end of words [36].
suffixes usually indicate a procedure, condition, disease, or part of speech [37]
.
Accurate spelling is essential in medical terminology [19].
For instance, "-phasia" means speaking, but "-phagia" means eating or
swallowing [20].
Adding "dys-" (difficult/painful) to "-phasia" makes "dysphasia" (difficulty
speaking) [21].
Adding "dys-" to "-phagia" makes "dysphagia" (difficulty eating or
swallowing) [21].
3. Combining Vowels and Word Building Rules
A combining vowel connects a word root to a suffix or another word root [39].
The combining vowel helps ease pronunciation [40].
In most cases, the combining vowel is "o" [40].
It can also be "i" or "e" when joining a suffix starting with a consonant [40].
A combining form is the combining vowel shown with the root word [41].
Rule Application
Prefix is always at the beginning [42] Example: "dys-" in dysuria [91]
Suffix is always at the end [42] Example: "-pathy" in nephropathy
[88]
Use a combining vowel when a suffix begins
with a consonant [43]
Makes pronunciation easier [43]
Use a combining vowel between two word
roots [43]
Even if the second root begins
with a vowel [43]
4. Plural Endings and Special Word Parts
Changing a singular term to plural follows specific rules [45].
Sometimes, you can simply add an "s" [45].
More complicated rules exist for other endings [45].
Singular Ending Plural Ending Example
-a -ae
[46]
-is -es
[47]
-ex or -ix -ices
[48]
-in, -im, -um -a
[48]
-us -i Bronchus becomes bronchi [48]
prefixes can indicate numbers, colors, positions, or directions [49].
prefixes for numbers include uni, dipli, null, primi, multi, or bi [50].
word roots for colors include cyano, leuco, uro, cyro, or melano [51].
prefixes for positions or directions include ab, add, d, circum, preemie, trans,
epi, or supra [52].
5. Directional and Movement Terms
directional terms are needed to discuss the specific location of an injury [53].
They can also describe how pain radiates [53].
superior means towards the head [56].
inferior means towards the feet [56].
lateral is away from the midline [57].
medial is towards the midline [57].
proximal is towards the trunk of the body [59].
distal is away from the trunk or nearer to the free end of an extremity [59].
Superficial is closer to or on the skin [60].
Deep is farther inside the body or tissue [60].
ventral refers to the belly side or anterior surface [61].
dorsal refers to the spinal side or posterior surface [61].
palmar is the front region or palm of the hand [62].
Plantar is the sole of the foot [62].
apex is the tip of any structure [62].
flexion is bending a joint [73].
extension is straightening a joint [73].
adduction is moving a body part towards the midline [74].
abduction is moving a body part away from the midline [74].
Bilateral means appearing on both sides of the midline [76].
Unilateral means appearing on only one side of the body [78].
6. Patient Positions
Position Description
Prone Patient is lying face down [80]
Supine Patient is lying face up [81]
Fowler's Semi-reclining with head elevated [83]
Semi-Fowler's Patient sits with back at a 45-degree angle [84]
High Fowler's Patient is sitting at a 90-degree angle [85]
7. Breaking Down Medical Terms: Examples
You can understand terms by breaking them into parts [87].
Nephropathy has three parts [87].
"-pathy" is the suffix meaning disease [88].
"o" is the combining form [89].
"nephra" is the word root meaning kidney [89].
Nephropathy means disease of the kidney [90].
dysuria can be broken down [91].
"-ia" is the suffix meaning a condition of [91].
"dys-" is the prefix meaning difficult, painful, or abnormal [92].
"ur" is the word root meaning urine [94].
dysuria means painful urination [94].
hyperemesis has a prefix and a word root [95].
"hyper-" is the prefix meaning excessive [96].
"emesis" is the word root meaning vomiting [97].
hyperemesis means excessive vomiting [97].
analgesic has a suffix, prefix, and word root [99].
"-ic" is the suffix meaning pertaining to [99].
"an-" is the prefix meaning without or absent of [99].
The word root refers to pain [99].
analgesic means pertaining to no pain [99].
8. Medical Abbreviations, Acronyms, and Symbols
Medical abbreviations, acronyms, and symbols are used as shorthand for
communication [100].
They allow for faster communication [100].
Only commonly understood abbreviations should be used [100].
This minimizes misinterpretations and errors [100].
The Joint Commission and Institute of Safe Medicine Practices are authorities
on abbreviations [101].
They provide "do not use" lists [101].
An acronym shortens several words, usually using the first letter of each [102].
It forms a shorter term pronounced as its own word [103].
Be familiar with accepted uses in your local jurisdiction [103].
Only widely understood and accepted symbols should be used [103].
Type Description
Abbreviations Shorthand for faster communication [100]
Acronyms Shortened terms using initial letters, pronounced as a word [102]
Symbols Shorthand for communication [100]
9. Review of Key Concepts
The word root conveys the essential meaning of a medical term [104].
prefixes indicate colors, numbers, positions, and directions [105].
The plural form of "bronchus" is "bronchi" [106].
Being superior to something means being closer to the head [107].
Movement of an arm towards the midline is called adduction [108].
A body part closer to the midline is medial [109].
ventral identifies a body part on the belly side or anterior surface [110].
The semi-fowler position means the patient is sitting at a 45-degree angle
[110].
A laceration on the plantar surface is on the sole of the foot [111].
When using abbreviations, EMTs should use those in their agency, use only
medically accepted ones, and use them to shorten documentation [111].
