1. Introduction to Lifespan Development in Emergency Care
Welcome to chapter 7 on lifespan development [1].
Understanding physiological and psychosocial differences is fundamental [2].
This chapter covers each phase of human development [2].
EMTs must be aware of physical changes across stages [5].
These changes alter the approach to patient care [5].
Discuss adaptations and strategies for patient assessment [3].
These strategies can improve patient management [3].
2. Neonates and Infants (Birth to 1 Year)
neonates are from birth to one month [6].
infants are from one month to a year [6].
They develop at a startling rate [6].
neonates weigh six to eight pounds at birth [7].
The head is 25% of their body weight [8].
infants grow about one ounce per day after week two [9].
They double their weight by four to six months [9].
Weight triples by the end of the first year [9].
At birth, neonates transition to independent circulation [10].
Prior to birth, lungs have never been inflated [11].
The first breath is facilitated by chest passage [11].
This increases inner thoracic pressure [11].
infants younger than six months are prone to nasal congestion [12].
infants have proportionately larger tongues [13].
They have proportionately shorter, narrow airways [13].
Airway obstructions are more common in infants [13].
The rib cage is less rigid [13].
Ribs sit horizontally for bag valve mask ventilation [13].
infant lungs are very fragile [14].
Forceful ventilations can result in trauma from pressure [14].
This is called barotrauma [14].
Respiratory muscles are immature [15].
There are fewer alveoli in the lungs [15].
Respiratory problems can quickly become life-threatening [15].
The nervous system evolves after birth [16].
neonates are born with certain reflexes [16].
moro reflex is a startle reflex [16].
They open arms wide and spread fingers [16].
They seem to grab at things [16].
palmer grasp occurs when an object is placed in palms [17].
rooting reflex: turns head towards touch on cheek [18].
sucking reflex occurs when lips are stroked [19].
fontanelles are spaces between skull bones [19].
The posterior fontanelle fuses at about three months [20].
The anterior fontanelle fuses at nine to 18 months [20].
A depressed fontanelle may indicate dehydration [21].
A bulging fontanelle indicates increased intracranial pressure [21].
By two months, infants track objects with eyes [24].
They can recognize familiar faces [24].
At six months, they can sit upright [25].
They begin making cooing and babbling sounds [25].
By 12 months, infants can walk with minimal assistance [26].
They know their name [26].
The immune system maintains some mother's immunities [27].
infants receive antibodies via breast milk [28].
Breast milk fosters further immune system boosters [28].
Psychosocial changes begin at birth [29].
Changes evolve as the infant interacts with the environment [29].
Crying is the main method of communicating distress [30].
Bonding is based on a secure attachment [30].
anxious avoidant attachment is seen in repeatedly rejected infants [30].
These children show little emotional response to caregivers [31].
They treat caregivers as strangers [31].
separation anxiety is common in older infants [32].
Trust and mistrust is a stage from birth to 18 months [33].
This involves infant's needs being met by caregivers [33].

Pulse rate is 80 to 140 beats per minute [36].
Respiratory rate is 20 to 25 breaths per minute [36].
Systolic blood pressure is 80 to 100 mmHg [36].
Lung musculature is not well-developed [37].
They cannot sustain deep or rapid respirations long [37].
Weight gain should level off [38].
Loss of passive immunity is impactful [38].
Neuromuscular growth makes considerable progress [39].
Toilet training is usually completed around 28 months [39].
The psychosocial challenge is autonomy versus shame and doubt [40].
Basic language is mastered around 36 months [41].
Interaction and playing games with others begins [41].
Cause and effect starts to be understood by 18 to 24 months [41].
Children recognize gender differences by observing role models [42].
4. School-Age Children (6 to 12 Years)
School-aged children are from 6 to 12 years [43].
Physical traits and functions mature rapidly [44].
They grow four pounds each year [45].
They grow two to five inches each year [45].
Permanent teeth come in [45].
Brain activity increases in both hemispheres [45].
Children learn various types of reasoning [46].
Three types of reasoning exist [46].
pre-conventional reasoning: acting to avoid punishment and get wants [47].
conventional reasoning: looking for approval from peers and society [48].
Post-conventional reasoning: making decisions guided by consequences
[48].
Children begin developing self-concept at this age [48].
They also develop self-esteem [48].

8. Older Adults (61 Years and Up)
Older adults include ages 61 years and up [72].
Life expectancy is constantly changing [73].
Currently, it is about 78 years old [73].
Life expectancy is determined by birth year and country [73].
They often overcome numerous medical conditions [74].
They may need multiple medications [74].
Cardiac function declines with age [75].
This is largely due to atherosclerosis [75].
Heart rate and cardiac output decrease [75].
Cardiac output may not meet body demands [76].
The vascular system becomes stiff [76].
The heart works harder to overcome vascular resistance [77].
Ability to provide replacement blood cells declines [77].
Blood volume also declines [77].
The size of airways may decrease or increase [78].
Surface area of alveoli decreases [78].
Elasticity and strength of intercostal muscles and diaphragm decrease [78].
Breathing becomes more labor intensive [78].
By age 75, vital capacity may be 50% of a young adult [79].
The chest becomes more rigid and fragile [80].
Cough and gag reflexes diminish [80].
Ability to clear secretions diminishes [80].
Older adults are at greater risk of aspiration [80].
They are also at greater risk of airway obstruction [80].
Smooth muscles of the lower airway weaken [81].
This causes airway collapse on inhalation [81].
This produces inspiratory wheezing [82].
Lower flow rates and air trapping in alveoli occur [82].
Older adults are more susceptible to lung infections [83].
Insulin production drops off [84].
Metabolism decreases [84].
Reproductive system changes occur [85].
Hormone production for both sexes decreases gradually [86].
Sexual desire may diminish but does not cease [86].
Changes occur in gastric and intestinal function [87].
This may inhibit natural intake and utilization [87].
Tooth loss may make chewing difficult [87].
Taste and sensations decrease [87].
Saliva secretion decreases [87].
This reduces ability to produce complex carbohydrates [87].
Intestines' ability to contract and move food diminishes [88].
Gastric acid secretion diminishes [88].
Gallstones become increasingly common [88].
Decreased elasticity of anal sphincter causes fecal incontinence [88].
Renal filtration function declines by 50% from 20 to 90 [89].
Kidney mass decreases 20% over the same span [90].
Blood supply reduction occurs in the kidneys [90].
Ability to remove waste decreases [91].
Ability to conserve fluids decreases when needed [91].
Brain weight may shrink 10 to 20% by age 80 [92].
Motor and sensory neural networks become slower [93].
Neurons are lost [94].
This does not mean loss of knowledge or skill [94].
Sleep patterns change [94].
Age-related shrinkage creates a void between brain and meninges [95].
This void provides room for the brain to move when stressed [95].
Peripheral nerves slow with age [96].
Sensations become diminished and may be misinterpreted [96].
Increased reaction time causes longer delays between stimulation and motion
[97].
Prolonged reaction times and slower reflexes contribute to falls [97].
Pupillary reaction and ocular movements become restricted [98].
Visual distortions are common [98].
Peripheral fields of vision narrow [98].
Hearing loss is four times more common than vision loss [98].
Loss of high frequency hearing or deafness occurs [98].
Most people retain high brain function until about five years before death [99].
95% of the elderly live at home [100].
They may need assistance from family, friends, or home health care [100].
Increased need exists for assisted living facilities [100].
Financial limits may restrict healthcare access or medications [100].
Over 50% of single women 60 or older live at or below poverty [101].
Facing their own mortality is an important issue [102].
Isolation and depression are also issues [102].
These changes can be challenges [103].

9. Conclusion and Review
Review questions test understanding of chapter concepts [105].
Bag valve mask ventilation in infants requires remembering lungs are
fragile [106].
An infant reaching out and drooling is likely four months old [107].
A repeatedly rejected infant experiences anxious avoidant attachment [108]
.
Colds develop easily in toddlers/preschoolers due to loss of passive
immunity, less developed lung musculature, and time around playmates
[109].
The pulse rate of a toddler is slightly higher than adults at 90 to 150 bpm
[111].
A school-aged child seeking peer/society approval shows conventional
reasoning [112].
self-concept is how we perceive ourselves [114].
Be concerned about a depressed 16-year-old because adolescents have a
higher suicide rate [114].
Finances become an issue in middle adulthood due to supporting children
and aging parents [115].
Breathing is more labor-intensive for the elderly due to decreased
intercostal muscle/diaphragm strength, decreased alveoli surface area,
and reduced elasticity of lung tissue [117].
This concludes chapter seven on lifespan development [119].
