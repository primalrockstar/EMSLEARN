Understanding the human body is important for medical professionals [2].
This understanding includes body planes and topographic anatomy [2].
Identifying basic structures and functions is also key [3].
Describing each body system and its role is necessary [3].
Understanding how systems interact to maintain life is vital [3].
Discussing the impact of illness or injury on function is crucial [4].
2. Topographic Anatomy and Body Planes
topographic anatomy applies to the body in the anatomic position [9].
The anatomic position is when the body stands facing you [10].
Arms are to the side, and palms face forward [10].
Body planes are imaginary straight lines that divide the body [11].
There are three main body planes [11].
The coronal (frontal) plane divides the body's front and back [12].
The sagittal (lateral) plane divides the body's left and right sides [13].
A mid-sagittal (midline) plane is a special sagittal plane [14].
It cuts the body in half, leaving equal left and right halves [15].
A transaxial plane divides the body's top and bottom [15].

Human Body
The human body is organized in a hierarchical manner [17].
Cells are the basic building blocks [18].
Cells with similar functions group together to form tissue [18].
Groups of tissues performing similar jobs form organs [18].
Organs with similar functions work together to form a body system [18].
Understanding this organization is key to understanding the body [19].
4. The Skeletal System: Structure and Function
Division Description Components
Axial Skeleton Forms the longitudinal axis
of the body [22]
Skull, facial bones, thoracic cage,
vertebral column [22]
Appendicular
Skeleton
Comprises the upper and
lower extremities and their
connections [23]
Upper extremity, pelvis, lower
extremity [49]
Joints Occur wherever bones
come in contact [25]
Ligaments, cartilage, tendons,
joint capsule, articular cartilage,
synovial membrane [26]
The skeletal system gives the body its form [20].
It also protects vital internal organs [20].
The adult skeletal system has 206 bones [21].
It has two major divisions: axial and appendicular [21].
The axial skeleton includes the skull down to the coccyx [22].
The appendicular skeleton includes the extremities [23].
The pelvis includes parts of both divisions [24].
Joints are where bones meet [25].
ligaments connect bone to bone and stabilize joints [26].
cartilage cushions bone ends [27].
tendons attach bone to muscle [28].
symphysis joints allow slight movement [29].
joint capsules hold bone ends together [30].
Articular cartilage allows bones to glide easily [30].
synovial membranes produce fluid for joint movement [31].
Types of joints include ball and socket and hinge joints [32].
The skull has 28 bones: cranium, facial, and ear bones [36].
The cranium protects the brain and has four bones [37].
These include the occiput, temporal, parietal, and frontal bones [38].
Facial bones include the maxilla, zygomas, mandible, orbits, and nasal bones
[38].
The spinal column has 33 vertebrae in five sections [39].
Sections are cervical (7), thoracic (12), lumbar (5), sacrum (5 fused), and
coccyx (4 fused) [41].
Vertebrae are connected by ligaments and discs [47].
The thorax is formed by thoracic vertebrae and ribs [48].
It protects the heart, lungs, esophagus, and great vessels [48].
The sternum is in the midline of the chest [48].
The upper extremities extend from the shoulder girdle to the fingertips [49].
The shoulder girdle includes the clavicle, scapula, and humerus [51].
The humerus is the arm's supporting bone [52].
The forearm has the radius (thumb side) and ulna (little finger side) [53].
The wrist is a modified ball and socket joint [56].
The hand has metacarpals and phalanges [56].
The pelvic girdle has hip bones, the sacrum, and the coccyx [56].
Each hip bone has the ilium, ischium, and pubis [56].
The pubic symphysis joins the pubic bones [57].
The femur is the longest bone in the lower extremity [58].
The femoral head connects to the pelvis [59].
The knee is a hinge joint connecting the femur to the tibia and fibula [60].
The lower leg bones are the tibia and fibula [60].
The foot has tarsals, metatarsals, and phalanges [62].
The ankle joint is formed by the tibia, fibula, and talus [63].
The foot has seven tarsal bones [65].
The talus and calcaneus are the largest tarsal bones [65].
Five metatarsal bones form the foot's substance [66].
The toes are formed by 14 phalanges [66].
The skeletal system allows movement and stores calcium [67].
It also helps create blood cells [67].
The musculoskeletal system provides posture and protects organs [68].
5. The Muscular System: Types and Actions
There are three types of muscles: skeletal, smooth, and cardiac [69].
Skeletal muscle attaches to bones [70].
It forms the major muscle mass and is voluntary [70].
Voluntary muscle is under the brain's direct control [70].
You can use skeletal muscle to pick things up [71].
Smooth muscle and cardiac muscle are involuntary [72].
They do not require constant thought to function [72].
Smooth muscle is in blood vessels and intestines [72].
Cardiac muscle is found in the heart [72].
Contraction and relaxation of skeletal muscle allow movement [74].
Skeletal muscle contraction also produces heat [75].
Shivering is involuntary muscle action to produce heat [75].
Muscles also protect underlying structures [75].
6. The Respiratory System: Anatomy and Physiology
Division Components Key Structures
Upper
Respiratory
System
Nose, mouth, tongue, jaw,
larynx [77]
Pharynx, trachea, epiglottis
[79]
Lower
Respiratory
System
Thyroid cartilage, cricoid
cartilage, cricoid thyroid
membrane [79]
Trachea, carina, main stem
bronchi, lungs, alveoli [79]
Lungs Held in place by trachea,
arteries, veins, ligaments [80]
Lobes (right has 3, left has
2), bronchi, bronchioles,
alveoli [80]
The respiratory system is responsible for breathing [76].
It exchanges oxygen and carbon dioxide in the lungs [76].
The system is divided into upper and lower parts [77].
The upper respiratory system includes the nose, mouth, tongue, jaw, and
larynx [77].
The larynx divides the upper and lower airways [78].
The pharynx, trachea, and epiglottis are also in the upper airway [79].
The lower airway includes the thyroid cartilage (Adam's apple) [79].
The cricoid cartilage and cricoid thyroid membrane are also present [79].
The trachea is below the cricoid cartilage [79].
It ends at the carina, dividing into bronchi [79].
Bronchi branch into smaller airways within the lungs [79].
The lungs are held in place by the trachea and vessels [80].
Each lung is divided into lobes [80].
The right lung has three lobes, and the left has two [80].
Within the lobes are bronchi and bronchioles [81].
These end at the alveoli, where gas exchange occurs [81].
alveoli exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide [81].
Pleura are membranes that cover the lungs (visceral) and line the chest wall
(parietal) [82].
Fluid between the pleura facilitates lung movement [82].
The pleural space is a potential space between the pleura [82].
The diaphragm is the primary muscle of breathing [83].
It contains voluntary and involuntary muscle [83].
Other muscles aiding breathing include cervical, intercostal, abdominal, and
pectoral muscles [83].
Inhalation is active; the diaphragm and intercostal muscles contract [85].
This creates a larger space in the thoracic cavity, and lungs fill [85].
It uses negative pressure ventilation [85].
Exhalation is passive; muscles relax [87].
The thoracic cavity returns to normal, and air flows out [87].
The respiratory system provides oxygen and eliminates carbon dioxide [90].
Ventilation is air movement between lungs and the environment [91].
Respiration is gas exchange in alveoli and tissues [91].
Oxygen and carbon dioxide move by diffusion [94].
Diffusion is passive movement from higher to lower concentration [95].
The brain stem controls breathing by monitoring carbon dioxide levels [95].
High carbon dioxide causes pH to decrease, stimulating breathing [95].
The medulla oblongata initiates ventilation via the phrenic nerve [96].
The primary reason for breathing is to lower carbon dioxide [97].
Patients with chronic lung disease may use a hypoxic drive [99].
This is a backup system stimulated by low oxygen levels [100].
The pons helps adjust breathing depth during stress [105].
tidal volume is air moved in a single breath (about 500 mL in adults) [107].
inspiratory reserve volume is the deepest breath after normal [107].
expiratory reserve volume is maximum air forcefully exhaled [107].
residual volume is gas remaining after exhalation [108].
dead space has no alveoli and little gas exchange [108].
minute volume assesses ventilation adequacy [110].
minute volume = respiratory rate × tidal volume [111].
Normal breathing has a regular rate and depth [112].
It has a regular rhythm of inhalation and exhalation [112].
Clear breath sounds should be heard on both sides of the chest [112].
The chest should rise and fall regularly on both sides [113].
Movement of the abdomen is also a sign [113].
Inadequate breathing signs include labored breathing [114].
Rates slower than 12 or faster than 20 are inadequate [114].
Muscle retractions, pale or cyanotic skin, cool damp skin, or tripod position
are signs [114].
7. The Circulatory System: Structure and Function
Component Description Function
Heart Involuntary muscle made of
myocardium [119]
Pumps blood throughout the body
[123]
Arteries High pressure vessels [129] Carry oxygenated blood from the
heart to tissues (except pulmonary
artery) [129]
Arterioles Smaller branches of arteries
[135]
Connect arteries to capillaries [135]
Capillaries Tiny blood vessels [138] Connect arteries to venules; gas
and nutrient exchange occurs here
[138]
Venules Small veins [138] Connect capillaries to veins [138]
Veins Oxygen depleted blood going
back to heart [142]
Carry deoxygenated blood back to
the heart (except pulmonary veins)
[142]
Blood Composed of plasma, red
blood cells, white blood cells,
platelets [150]
Transports oxygen, CO2, waste,
nutrients; fights infection;
coagulates [166]
The circulatory system, or cardiovascular system, is a network of tubes [115].
It includes arteries, arterioles, capillaries, venules, and veins [115].
There are two circuits: systemic and pulmonary [116].
systemic circulation carries oxygen-rich blood from the left ventricle to the
body and back to the right atrium [116].
Pulmonary circulation carries oxygen-poor blood from the right ventricle to
the lungs and back to the left atrium [117].
The heart is an involuntary muscle made of myocardium [119].
It functions as two paired pumps [121].
The left side is a high-pressure pump; the right side is low-pressure [121].
The top chambers are atria; the bottom are ventricles [122].
The heart receives blood from the aorta via coronary arteries [123].
The right side gets deoxygenated blood from body veins [123].
Oxygenated blood returns from the lungs to the left side via pulmonary veins
[124].
Valves guide blood flow through the heart [124].
A normal heart rate is 60 to 100 beats per minute [126].
Stroke volume (SV) is the blood moved by one beat [126].
Cardiac output (CO) is the blood moved in one minute [126].
CO = Heart Rate × SV [126].
The heart has an electrical conduction system [127].
Impulses start at the sinoatrial node and travel through the heart [127].
This produces a coordinated pumping action [128].
Arteries are high-pressure vessels carrying blood away from the heart [129].
They carry oxygenated blood, except for the pulmonary artery [130].
The aorta is the main artery leaving the left heart [131].
Its branches supply vital organs [132].
The pulmonary artery originates at the right ventricle and carries
deoxygenated blood to the lungs [134].
Arteries branch into arterioles, which connect to capillaries [135].
The pulse is created by blood pumped into major arteries [137].
It can be felt at the neck, wrist, and groin [137].
Capillaries are tiny vessels connecting arteries to venules [138].
Oxygen and nutrients pass through thin capillary walls to tissues [139].
Capillaries allow blood flow one cell at a time [140].
Veins carry oxygen-depleted blood back to the heart [142].
They have thinner walls and are larger than arteries [142].
Major veins include the superior and inferior vena cava [143].
The spleen is a solid organ filtering worn-out blood cells and foreign
substances [146].
The spleen is highly vascular and susceptible to injury [148].
Blood is composed of plasma, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets
[150].
Plasma is the liquid portion with water, proteins, and nutrients [150].
Red blood cells (erythrocytes) contain hemoglobin and carry oxygen [150].
White blood cells (leukocytes) fight infection [151].
Platelets help form blood clots [152].
Blood pressure is the force against artery walls [153].
Systole is when the left ventricle contracts and pumps blood [154].
Diastole is when the ventricle relaxes and fills with blood [155].
Blood pressure is measured with a cuff [156].
It is expressed in millimeters of mercury [157].
Perfusion is adequate blood circulation in organs and tissues [158].
Hypoperfusion, or shock, is inadequate blood supply [159].
The body can adjust to small blood loss by constricting vessels and
increasing heart rate [161].
Large blood loss can lead to shock [163].
Mean arterial pressure can help detect shock [164].
Mean arterial pressure = Cardiac Output × SVR [165].
Blood functions include fighting infection, transporting oxygen/CO2,
controlling pH, transporting waste/nutrients, and coagulation [166].
8. Nervous System Control of the Cardiovascular System
The nervous system controls the cardiovascular system [168].
This involves the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems [169].
The sympathetic nervous system controls the "fight or flight" response [169].
It signals adrenal glands to secrete epi and norepi [169].
These stimulate the heart and blood vessels [169].
Alpha adrenergic receptors are in blood vessels and cause contraction when
stimulated [170].
Beta adrenergic receptors are in the heart and lungs [170].
Beta-1 stimulation increases heart rate and contraction force [171].
Beta-2 stimulation dilates lung bronchi [171].
The parasympathetic nervous system causes heart rate to slow and beat
more weakly [171].
It is nearly the opposite of the sympathetic system [172].
The sympathetic and parasympathetic systems usually balance each other
[172].
Baroreceptors detect pressure in blood vessels [173].
They are found in the aorta and carotid bodies [173].
Baroreceptor stimulation adjusts blood pressure via the nervous systems [173].
9. The Nervous System: Central and Peripheral Divisions
Division Components Function
Central Nervous
System (CNS)
Brain, Spinal Cord [176] Most complex system; controls
voluntary and involuntary
actions; transmits messages
[174]
Peripheral Nervous
System (PNS)
Nerves outside brain and
spinal cord [176]
Connects CNS to rest of the
body; divided into somatic and
autonomic [177]
Somatic Nervous
System (PNS
subdivision)
Nerves transmitting
signals to voluntary
muscles [198]
Regulates voluntary control
(walking, talking, writing) [177]
Autonomic Nervous
System (PNS
subdivision)
Involuntary nerves
(sympathetic,
parasympathetic) [199]
Controls automatic functions
(smooth muscle, cardiac
muscle, fight or flight, rest and
digest) [178]
The nervous system is perhaps the most complex system [174].
It is divided into two main portions [175].
The central nervous system (CNS) includes the brain and spinal cord [176].
The peripheral nervous system (PNS) includes all nerves outside the brain
and spinal cord [176].
The PNS is divided into the somatic and autonomic nervous systems [177].
The somatic nervous system regulates voluntary control [177].
The autonomic nervous system controls automatic functions [178].
The brain has three parts: cerebrum, cerebellum, and brain stem [180].
The cerebrum is the largest part [180].
It is responsible for higher brain function [180].
It has two hemispheres, each with four lobes [181].
These lobes are frontal, parietal, occipital, and temporal [182].
The frontal lobe handles personality and judgment [183].
The parietal lobe deals with recognition [184].
The occipital lobe deals with vision [184].
The temporal lobe handles taste, hearing, and understanding words [184].
The cerebellum controls balance, coordination, and posture [185].
The brain stem controls life-sustaining functions [187].
These include cardiac and respiratory functions and consciousness regulation
[187].
The brain stem is comprised of the midbrain, pons, and medulla oblongata
[188].
The reticular activating system regulates consciousness [188].
Cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) filters impurities and cushions the brain/spinal
cord [190].
Oxygenated blood is supplied to the head by carotid arteries [192].
Deoxygenated blood drains via jugular veins [192].
The spinal cord is an extension of the brain stem [194].
It leaves the skull through the foramen magnum [195].
It is encased in the vertebral column [195].
Its main function is to transmit messages between the brain and the body [196]
.
The peripheral nervous system has two parts: voluntary and involuntary [197]
.
The somatic nervous system transmits signals to voluntary muscles [198].
It allows activities like walking and writing [198].
The autonomic nervous system is involuntary [199].
It includes the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions [199].
The PNS has sensory and motor nerves [200].
Sensory nerves carry information from the body to the CNS [200].
Motor nerves carry information from the brain to muscles [200].
10. The Integumentary System: Layers and Functions
The integumentary system is the skin [201].
It has two main layers: the epidermis and the dermis [201].
The epidermis is the superficial, watertight layer [201].
It is like a protective covering [201].
The epidermis is composed of layers, including the stratum corneum [202].
Skin cells in the epidermis are constantly replaced [202].
The dermis is the deeper layer [203].
It contains special structures of the skin [203].
These include sweat glands, sebaceous glands, and hair follicles [203].
Blood vessels and mucous membranes are also in the dermis [203].
Below the skin is the subcutaneous tissue [204].
This is a layer of fat [204].
Subcutaneous tissue serves as an insulator and energy reservoir [204].
The skin is the largest single organ [205].
It has three major functions [206].
It protects the body from the environment [206].
It regulates body temperature [206].
It transmits information from the environment to the brain [206].
11. The Digestive System: Organs and Processes
Organ Quadrant Location(s) Primary Function
Liver Upper right, extends into
upper left [210]
Filters harmful substances; forms
clotting factors; stores
sugar/starch; produces bile [227]
Gallbladder Upper right [210] Stores bile from the liver [228]
Stomach Upper left [211] Receives and stores food; produces
movement into the bowel [222]
Spleen Upper left [211] Filters blood (part of
lymphatic/circulatory) [147]
Large
Intestines
(Colon)
Portions in upper right,
upper left, right lower,
lower left [210]
Absorbs final 5-10% of digested
food/water; forms solid stool [229]
Small
Intestines
More than one quadrant
[214]
Produce enzymes and mucus to aid
digestion [229]
Pancreas Behind the abdominal
cavity (Retroperitoneal)
[215]
Secretes pancreatic juice
(exocrine); produces insulin and
glucagon (endocrine) [224]
Kidneys Behind the abdominal
cavity (Retroperitoneal)
[215]
Filter blood waste; control
water/salt balance [248]
Urinary
Bladder
Behind pubic symphysis in
pelvic cavity [214]
Stores urine [254]
Appendix Right lower abdomen [230] Opens into the first part of the
intestines; can become inflamed
(appendicitis) [230]
Rectum Not specified by quadrant,
but large hollow organ
holding feces [232]
Holds feces until expelled [232]
The digestive system is also called the gastrointestinal system [208].
Its components include the abdomen, organs, and vascular structures [208].
The abdomen contains major organs of digestion and excretion [208].
The abdomen is divided into four quadrants [208].
Upper right: liver, gallbladder, portion of colon [210].
Upper left: stomach, spleen, portion of colon [211].
Right lower: portion of large intestines [212].
Lower left: descending and sigmoid colon [213].
Some organs are in more than one quadrant [214].
The kidneys and pancreas are retroperitoneal, behind the abdominal cavity
[215].
Digestion begins in the mouth [218].
The mouth includes cheeks, lips, gums, teeth, tongue, and palates [218].
Salivary glands produce saliva [218].
The oral pharynx is a tube from the mouth back to the esophagus/trachea
[219].
The esophagus is a tube from the pharynx to the stomach [220].
Muscles propel food down the esophagus [221].
The stomach is a hollow organ in the left upper quadrant [222].
It receives, stores, and moves food into the bowel [222].
The pancreas is retroperitoneal, below and behind the liver/stomach [223].
Its exocrine portion secretes pancreatic juice [224].
Its endocrine portion produces insulin and glucagon [224].
Insulin is produced in the pancreas [292].
The liver is a large, solid organ in the right upper quadrant [225].
It filters substances, forms clotting factors, and stores sugar [227].
Bile ducts connect the liver to the intestine and gallbladder [228].
The small intestines produce enzymes and mucus for digestion [229].
The large intestine includes the cecum, colon, and rectum [229].
Its main function is absorbing water and forming stool [229].
The appendix is a tube in the right lower abdomen [230].
It can become inflamed, causing appendicitis [231].
The rectum holds feces until expelled through the anus [232].
Sphincters control the escape of contents from the digestive tract [233].
Digestion is completed by chemical processes using enzymes [235].
Enzymes break food into sugars, fatty acids, and amino acids [237].
Digested products are absorbed into the bloodstream and circulated [238].
12. The Lymphatic System: Components and Role
The lymphatic system is important but not talked about much [240].
Its elements include the spleen, lymph nodes, lymph vessels, and thymus
gland [241].
It supports the circulatory and immune systems [241].
Lymph is a thin fluid that carries oxygen, nutrients, and hormones to cells [241]
.
It also carries waste products away from cells [241].
Lymph vessels form a network throughout the body [241].
This network serves as an auxiliary to the circulatory system [241].
Lymph nodes are tiny structures that filter lymph [242].
They help rid the body of toxins and harmful materials [242].
13. The Endocrine System: Hormones and Regulation
The endocrine system is a complex message and control system [244].
It integrates many body functions [244].
Endocrine glands release hormones directly into the bloodstream [245].
Each gland produces one or more hormones [245].
Each hormone has a specific effect on an organ, tissue, or process [245].
The brain controls the release of hormones [246].
The system uses feedback loops to maintain body balance [246].
Excessive or deficient hormone levels can cause diseases like diabetes [247].
14. The Urinary System: Function and Organs
The urinary system controls the discharge of waste filtered from blood [248].
Its main functions are controlling fluid balance and eliminating waste [249].
It also helps control the body's pH [249].
The kidneys are two solid organs in the retroperitoneal space [250].
They rid blood of toxic waste and control water/salt balance [252].
The ureters pass from each kidney to the urinary bladder [253].
The urinary bladder is located behind the pubic symphysis [254].
The urethra controls urine flow from the bladder out of the body [255].
15. The Genital System: Reproductive Processes
The genital system controls the reproductive processes [256].
The male reproductive system includes testes, epididymis, vas deferens,
prostate gland, seminal vesicles, and penis [257].
It lies mostly outside the pelvic cavity [257].
The female reproductive system includes ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus,
cervix, and vagina [258].
It is contained entirely within the pelvic cavity [259].
16. The Life Support Chain and Metabolism
Cells are the body's foundation and require oxygen, nutrients, and waste
removal [260].
The respiratory and circulatory systems deliver these supplies [260].
Interference with these systems can damage and kill cells [260].
Cells use oxygen and nutrients to create chemical energy through
metabolism [261].
Aerobic metabolism uses oxygen to create energy (ATP) [262].
When oxygen is limited, cells switch to anaerobic metabolism [262].
Anaerobic metabolism produces lactic acid as a waste product [263].
Accumulation of lactic acid and waste makes the area toxic [263].
This can eventually lead to cell death [263].
Movement of oxygen, waste, and nutrients occurs by diffusion [264].
pH is critical to diffusion [264].
The body uses significant energy to maintain normal pH [264].
17. Pathophysiology: Respiratory Compromise and Shock

and tissues
[159]

Pathophysiology studies functional changes in disease [265].
Respiratory compromise is the inability to effectively move gas [265].
It can lead to hypoxia (low oxygen) or hypercarbia (high carbon dioxide) [266]
.
Causes include blocked or obstructed airways [267].
Damaged breathing muscles can also cause it [267].
Trauma, allergic reactions, and high altitudes are causes [267].
Impaired gas movement across membranes is a cause [267].
A ventilation/perfusion mismatch occurs when gas movement or blood flow
is abnormal [268].
Pulmonary emboli or fluid in alveoli cause mismatches [269].
Respiratory compromise causes oxygen levels to fall and carbon dioxide to
rise [270].
The brain increases the respiratory rate to compensate [270].
If ineffective, blood becomes more acidotic [271].
Decreased oxygen forces cells into anaerobic metabolism [273].
This leads to shock, inadequate blood flow and oxygen [274].
Impaired oxygen delivery causes cellular hypoxia [275].
Hypoxia leads to anaerobic metabolism and lactic acid production [275].
This results in organ dysfunction [275].
The effects of shock are similar to respiratory compromise [278].
Oxygen supplied to tissues fails [278].
Cells switch to anaerobic metabolism and produce lactic acid [278].
Baroreceptors detect decreased blood pressure [279].
They initiate the release of epi and norepi [279].
This increases heart rate and contraction force [280].
Blood vessels contract, and fluid moves into capillaries [280].
Anaerobic metabolism requires more energy than aerobic [282].
It can result in metabolic acidosis [281].
There is decreased ability of blood to carry oxygen [283].
Brain cells cannot use alternative fuels [284].
Decreased glucose can damage and kill brain cells [284].
Cellular injury can be repairable if perfusion is restored [285].
Irreversible injury means no treatment will help [285].
