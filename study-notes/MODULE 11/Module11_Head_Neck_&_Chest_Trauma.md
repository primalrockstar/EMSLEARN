## Chapter 28: Face and Neck Injuries

### Overview
Explores assessment and management of trauma to the face and neck, including airway compromise and bleeding.

### Learning Objectives
- Assess and manage airway threats in face/neck trauma.
- Control bleeding and protect airway.
- Recognize complications (airway obstruction, shock).

### Key Terms
| Term        | Definition |
|-------------|------------|
| Airway Obstruction | Blockage of airflow. |
| Jugular Vein | Major neck vein, risk of severe bleeding. |
| Crepitus     | Crackling sensation from air under skin. |

### Major Concepts & Guidelines
- Airway is highest priority.
- Control bleeding with direct pressure, careful not to obstruct airway.
- Be alert for signs of airway compromise and shock.

### Procedures / Protocols
- **Airway Management:**  
  - Jaw-thrust, suction, advanced airway as indicated.
- **Bleeding Control:**  
  - Direct pressure, occlusive dressing for neck wounds.

### Assessment & Clinical Pearls
- Watch for expanding hematoma and stridor.
- Consider cervical spine injury.

### Documentation Standards
- Record injury details, interventions, airway status.

### Case Example
> Neck laceration with bubbling wound and difficulty breathing. What should EMS do?

### Quick Reference Table
| Injury      | Threat         | Intervention      |
|-------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Neck wound  | Airway, bleeding | Occlusive dressing |

### Review Questions
1. Why is airway management critical in face/neck trauma?
2. What is crepitus?
3. When is cervical spine immobilization indicated?

## Chapter 29: Head and Spine Injuries

### Overview
Covers assessment and management of traumatic brain injury and spinal cord injury.

### Learning Objectives
- Recognize signs/symptoms of head and spine injury.
- Safely immobilize and transport patients.
- Prevent secondary injury.

### Key Terms
| Term         | Definition |
|--------------|------------|
| Concussion   | Mild traumatic brain injury. |
| Hematoma     | Collection of blood. |
| Paralysis    | Loss of motor function. |

### Major Concepts & Guidelines
- Suspect cervical spine injury in trauma with AMS, neck pain, or paralysis.
- Monitor for signs of increased ICP (Cushing’s triad).
- Immobilize spine if indicated.

### Procedures / Protocols
- **Spinal Immobilization:**  
  - Use cervical collar and backboard as per protocol.
- **Head Injury:**  
  - Monitor GCS, airway, ventilation.

### Assessment & Clinical Pearls
- Serial neuro exams are vital.
- Watch for vomiting and unequal pupils.

### Documentation Standards
- Record GCS, findings, immobilization, interventions.

### Case Example
> Fall from height, unconscious with unequal pupils. What are EMS priorities?

### Quick Reference Table
| Symptom      | Possible Injury | Action           |
|--------------|----------------|------------------|
| AMS + trauma | Head injury    | Airway, immobilize |

### Review Questions
1. What is Cushing’s triad?
2. When is spinal immobilization required?
3. List two signs of increased ICP.

## Chapter 30: Chest Injuries

### Overview
Discusses trauma to the chest including rib fractures, pneumothorax, and cardiac tamponade.

### Learning Objectives
- Recognize life-threatening chest injuries.
- Provide appropriate field management.
- Identify signs of tension pneumothorax and tamponade.

### Key Terms
| Term         | Definition |
|--------------|------------|
| Flail Chest  | Segment of broken ribs moving independently. |
| Pneumothorax | Air in pleural space. |
| Tamponade    | Compression of heart by fluid/blood. |

### Major Concepts & Guidelines
- Chest trauma may impair breathing and circulation.
- Tension pneumothorax: respiratory distress, JVD, tracheal deviation.
- Tamponade: muffled heart sounds, hypotension, JVD.

### Procedures / Protocols
- **Chest Injury Management:**  
  - Oxygen, ventilatory support, seal open chest wounds.
- **Flail Chest:**  
  - Stabilize, support breathing.

### Assessment & Clinical Pearls
- Monitor for worsening respiratory distress.
- Rapid transport for unstable patients.

### Documentation Standards
- Record injury details, interventions, vital signs.

### Case Example
> Stab wound to chest, respiratory distress, JVD. What is likely and what should EMS do?

### Quick Reference Table
| Injury         | Key Sign        | Intervention     |
|----------------|----------------|------------------|
| Open pneumothorax | Sucking sound | Occlusive dressing |

### Review Questions
1. What is a flail chest?
2. What are signs of tension pneumothorax?
3. How is open chest wound managed?
