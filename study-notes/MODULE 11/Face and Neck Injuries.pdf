1. Introduction to Face and Neck Injuries
The face and neck are very vulnerable to injury [9].
Their position on the body is relatively unprotected [9].
Soft tissue injuries and fractures are common [10].
These injuries can vary in severity [10].
Some injuries are life-threatening [11].
An example is penetrating trauma to the neck [11].
This type of injury may cause severe bleeding [11].
An open injury may allow an air embolism to enter the circulatory system [11].
Understanding the anatomy and physiology of these areas is important [12].
This report covers managing trauma related issues with the face and neck [2]
.
It also helps in recognizing life threats associated with these emergencies [3].
The correlation with head and spinal trauma is also discussed [3].

4. Patient Assessment for Face and Neck Injuries
Scene safety is the highest priority in patient assessment [80].
Assess for potential violence or environmental hazards [80].
Standard precautions include eye protection and a face mask [81].
This is due to the potential for projectile blood [81].
Determine the number of patients and consider additional resources [82].
The mechanism of injury (MOI) is very important [83].
Assess the scene for indicators of the MOI [84].
Common MOIs include motor vehicle collisions, sports falls, penetrating
trauma, and blunt trauma [85].
The primary assessment focuses on identifying life-threatening concerns
[86].
Threats to X, A, B, C's must be treated immediately [86].
Life-threatening external hemorrhage should be addressed before airway
and breathing [86].
Form a general impression to gauge the patient's condition seriousness [87].
Injuries may be obvious or hidden [88].
Control blood loss with direct pressure [89].
Consider the need for spinal immobilization [89].
Check responsiveness using the AVPU scale [89].
Ensure a clear and patent airway [90].
Consider an oral pharyngeal airway if the patient is unresponsive [91].
Quickly assess the adequacy of breathing [92].
Splinting or restricting chest wall motion is contraindicated [93].
Assess the pulse and quality (Circulation) [95].
Significant bleeding is an immediate life threat [95].
Make a transport decision (D) [96].
Quickly transport patients with airway/breathing problems or significant
bleeding [96].
Stabilization may be difficult [97].
Consider advanced life support backup if transport is long [98].
Patients with internal bleeding need rapid transport [99].
Signs of hypoperfusion imply the need for rapid transport [100].
Patients with a significant MOI appearing stable should also be transported
promptly [101].
A significant blow to the face or throat increases suspicion of spinal or brain
injury [102].
Even without signs of hypoperfusion or other life-threatening injuries,
suspicion should be high [102].
There is a possibility of eye injuries [103].
In history taking, investigate the chief complaint and obtain medical history
[103].
Be alert for injury specific signs and symptoms [103].
Be aware of pertinent negatives [103].
Get a SAMPLE history [104].
Attempt to gather history from friends or family if the patient is unresponsive
[104].
In unresponsive patients, only signs of injuries are noticeable [105].
For the secondary assessment, if multiple systems are affected, start with an
entire body assessment [105].
Look for decap btls [105].
Do not delay transport to complete a thorough physical exam in certain
patients [105].
Consider focusing the physical exam in responsive patients with isolated
injuries [106].
Ensure control of bleeding is maintained [106].
Note the location of the injury [106].
Inspect the wound for foreign matter and stabilize objects [107].
Use both eyes and hands [108].
Explain the examination process to a responsive patient [109].
Assess all underlying systems [109].
When evaluating the eyes, start with outer aspects and work towards the
pupils [110].
visual acuity is considered the vital sign of the eye [111].
Assess and maintain baseline vital signs [112].
Observe for any changes during treatment [112].
Be concerned with visible and unseen bleeding [113].
Baseline information about respirations and pulse is important [114].
Use monitoring devices and perform reassessment [114].
Repeat the primary assessment, reassess vital signs and chief complaint [115].
Continually reassess the adequacy of airway, breathing, and circulation [115].
Recheck patient interventions [116].
Reassessment is particularly important in facial/neck injuries [116].
Patient condition should be reassessed at least every 5 minutes [116].
5. Emergency Medical Care for Face and Neck Injuries
Injury Type Key Emergency Care Interventions Source
General Care Complete spinal immobilization if suspected
spinal injuries; Maintain open airway; Prepare to
suction; Consider oral/nasal airway; Provide
high-flow oxygen; Control significant visual
bleeding; Treat for shock if hypoperfusion
signs; Rapid transport if seriously injured.
[117]
Soft Tissue
Injuries
Assess X ABC's and life threats first; Follow
standard precautions; Open and clear airway
(avoid neck movement if cervical injury
suspected); Control bleeding with direct
pressure and sterile dressing; Do not apply
excessive pressure if skull fracture suspected;
Cover exposed structures with moist sterile
dressing; Apply ice to injuries that do not break
skin; Check for bleeding inside the mouth; Save
avulsed skin wrapped in sterile dressing and
keep cool; Place loose skin flaps close to
normal position.
[123]
Eye - Foreign
Objects
Irrigate with sterile saline solution; For objects
on the eyelid, remove with a moist, cottontipped
applicator; For impaled objects, stabilize
and transport, bandage both eyes.
[137]
Eye - Burns Stop the burn and prevent further damage; For
chemical burns, flush with water or sterile
solution continuously (20+ mins for strong
acids/alkaloids); Apply clean dry dressing and
cover eye; For thermal burns, cover both eyes
with sterile dressing moistened with saline; For
light burns, cover each eye with sterile moist
pad and eye shield.
[143]
Eye - Lacerations If globe laceration, apply no pressure; Gently
apply moist sterile dressing; Cover with a
protective metal shield, cup, or sterile dressing;
Apply soft dressing to both eyes; If eyeball
dislodged, do not reposition, cover and
stabilize with moist sterile dressing, cover both
eyes, keep patient supine.
[156]
Eye - Blunt
Trauma
Protect injured eye with metal shield; Cover the
other eye to minimize movement.
[164]
Eye - Blast
Injuries
Management depends on severity.
[169]
Eye - Contact
Lenses/Artificial
Eyes
Generally do not remove (except chemical
burns); Remove hard lenses with suction cup;
Remove soft lenses by pinching gently after
adding saline; Place lenses in saline and advise
hospital; Care for artificial eye like a normal one.
[171]
Nosebleeds
(Epistaxis)
For non-trauma patient bleeding heavily, place
in sitting position leaning forward and pinch
nostrils; For trauma-related bleeding, apply
sterile dressing.
[183]
Ear Injuries Apply local pressure to control bleeding; If
severe ear avulsion, wrap avulsed part in moist
sterile dressing, place in labeled plastic bag; Do
not remove foreign objects from the ear canal;
Do not try to manipulate foreign bodies.
[187]
Facial Fractures Remove and save loose teeth or bone
fragments from the mouth; Remove loose
dentures and dental bridges to protect airway;
Swelling can be a source of obstruction.
[196]
Dental Injuries Apply direct pressure to stop bleeding from
displaced teeth; Perform suctioning if needed;
Save and transport avulsed tooth by the crown;
Place tooth in storage solution, milk, or sterile
saline.
[200]
Cheek Injuries If unable to control bleeding compromising
airway, consider removing the object; Provide
direct pressure on both sides (inside and out);
Bandaging should not occlude the mouth.
[202]
Neck Injuries
(Blunt Trauma)
Maintain airway; Immediately transport;
Consider advanced life support early; Consider
spinal motion restriction.
[207]
Neck Injuries
(Penetrating
Trauma)
Direct pressure over the bleeding site; Assess
for signs of shock; Immediate spinal motion
restriction if indicated; Apply high-flow oxygen;
Do not remove penetrating or impaled objects
unless interfering with CPR; Stabilize all
impaled objects if not obstructing airway.
[213]
Laryngeal
Injuries
Maintain airway; Immediately transport;
Consider advanced life support early; Consider
spinal motion restriction; Do not remove
penetrating or impaled objects unless
interfering with CPR; Stabilize impaled objects
if not obstructing airway; Provide oxygen and
[207]
ventilate; Keep patient supine; Avoid use of a
rigid collar.
6. Complications and Considerations
Injuries to the face and neck can frequently cause airway obstruction [65].
Several factors can contribute to this obstruction [65].
These include blood clots from heavy facial bleeding [66].
Direct injuries to the nose, mouth, larynx, and trachea can cause bleeding
and respiratory compromise [66].
Dislodged teeth or dentures can become an airway obstruction [67].
Swelling from soft tissue injury can also cause obstruction [68].
Airway can be affected by turning the patient's head [69].
Brain and cervical spine injuries may interfere with normal respirations [69].
Facial fractures also carry the danger of blood clots obstructing the airway
[195].
Swelling can be extreme within 24 hours after injury [198].
A life-threatening complication is an air embolism [11].
This may result from an open injury allowing air into the circulatory system
[12].
It can occur if a vein has been punctured in the neck [211].
Rapid transport is crucial for certain patients [96].
This includes patients with airway or breathing problems or significant
bleeding [96].
Patients with internal bleeding must be transported quickly [99].
Signs of hypoperfusion imply the need for rapid transport [100].
Even patients appearing stable but with a significant MOI should be
transported promptly [101].
Advanced life support (ALS) should be considered [98].
This is important if transport is too long [98].
Consider ALS early for neck injuries [208].
