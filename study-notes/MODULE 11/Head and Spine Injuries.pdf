Chapter 29, Head and Spine Injuries
1. Introduction to Head and Spine Injuries
This chapter focuses on head and spine injuries [1].
Understanding this material helps manage trauma-related issues [2].
It is crucial to recognize life threats from these injuries [3].
Immediate spinal stabilization is essential [3].
Airway and breathing support may also be needed [3].

The nervous system is a complex network of nerve cells [9].
It includes the brain, spinal cord, nerve fibers, and nerves [10].
The nervous system is well protected by bony structures [11].
Serious injuries can damage the nervous system despite this protection [12].
The central nervous system includes the brain and spinal cord [16].
The brain controls the body [17].
It is the center of consciousness [17].
The brain is divided into three major areas: cerebrum, cerebellum, and
brainstem [18].
The cerebrum controls voluntary motor function and conscious
thought [20].
The cerebellum coordinates balance and body movements [22].
The brain stem controls most functions necessary for life [23].
This includes cardiac and respiratory systems [23].
It is the best protected part of the central nervous system [24].
The spinal cord carries messages between the brain and body [25].
The central nervous system is protected by the meninges [27].
These are three layers of tissues [27].
The outer layer, dura mater, is a tough, fibrous sac [28].
The inner two layers, arachnoid mater and pia mater, contain blood
vessels [29].
Cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) is produced inside the brain [31].
It is produced in the third ventricle [32].
CSF acts primarily as a shock absorber [33].
Clear, watery CSF may leak from the nose, ears, or an open skull fracture if
protective layers are penetrated [34].
The peripheral nervous system has spinal nerves and cranial nerves [36].
Spinal nerves conduct impulses to and from the spinal cord [37].
Cranial nerves transport information directly to or from the brain [40].
Cranial nerves perform special functions in the head and face [41].
There are two types of peripheral nerves: sensory and motor [42].
Sensory nerves carry information from the body to the brain [44].
Motor nerves carry information from the central nervous system to the
muscles [45].
Connecting nerves are found in the brain and spinal cord [46].
They connect sensory and motor nerves [46].
The nervous system controls reflex activities, voluntary activities, and
involuntary activities [48].
A reflex arc in the spinal cord allows simple messages to bypass the brain
[49].
The somatic nervous system handles voluntary activities [52].
The autonomic nervous system handles involuntary functions [53].
The autonomic system is divided into sympathetic and parasympathetic
divisions [54].
The sympathetic system reacts to stress with the fight or flight response
[56].
The parasympathetic system has opposite effects, such as slowing heart
rate [57].
These divisions balance each other for homeostasis [58].
3. Skeletal Structures Protecting the Nervous System
The skeletal system includes the skull and the spinal cord [61].
The skull is composed of cranial and facial bones [61].
The brain connects to the spinal cord through the foramen magnum [62].
Four major bones make up the cranium: occipital, temporal, parietal, and
frontal [63].
The face is composed of 14 bones, including the maxilla, zygoma,
mandible, nasal, and frontal [64].
The spinal cord is the body's central supporting structure [66].
It has 33 vertebrae [67].
These are divided into five sections: cervical, thoracic, lumbar, sacral, and
coccygeal [68].
The front part of each vertebrae is the vertebral body [70].
The back forms a bony arch [70].
The series of arches forms the spinal canal [71].
The spinal canal protects the spinal cord [71].
Vertebrae are connected by ligaments and separated by intervertebral
discs [72].
4. Head Injuries: Types, Mechanisms, and Signs
Aspect Description
Definition Traumatic insult to the head [74]
Impact May injure soft tissue, bony structures, or the brain [74] accounts
for over half of traumatic deaths [75]
Types Closed head injury, Open head injury [78]
Mechanisms Falls, Motor vehicle crashes, Assaults, Sports related incidents [81]
General
Signs
Various signs listed in a table [83]
A head injury is a traumatic insult to the head [74].
It can injure soft tissue, bony structures, or the brain [74].
Head injuries account for over half of all traumatic deaths [75].
Fatal injuries always involve the brain [76].
Be aware of additional trauma the patient may have [77].
There are generally two types of head injuries: closed and open [78].
In closed head injuries, the brain is injured, but there is no opening [79].
An open head injury has an opening to the outside world [80].
This is often caused by penetrating trauma [80].
Brain tissue may be exposed [80].
Common mechanisms of injury include falls and motor vehicle crashes [81].
Other mechanisms include assaults and sports incidents [82].
General signs and symptoms are shown in a table [83].
5. Specific Types of Head Injuries
Injury Type Description Key Characteristics / Signs
Scalp
Lacerations
Minor or serious cuts
to the scalp [84]
Can lead to significant blood loss,
especially in children [84] May contribute to
hypovolemia in multiple injuries [85]
Skull
Fractures
Break in the skull
bone [86]
May be open or closed [87] Result from
significant force [86]
Linear Skull
Fracture
Accounts for 80% of
skull fractures [90]
Often no physical signs [91] Diagnosed with
radiographs [91]
Depressed
Skull Fracture
High-energy direct
trauma [92]
Bony fragments may injure the brain [93]
Patients may have neurologic injury signs,
like loss of consciousness [94] Most
susceptible areas are frontal and parietal
bones [93]
Basilar Skull
Fracture
Associated with
high-energy diffuse
impact [95]
Extension of linear fractures to the base of
the skull [96] Signs include CSF draining
from ears, raccoon eyes, Battle signs [98]
Diagnosed with CT [97]
Open Skull
Fracture
Often associated
with trauma to
multiple systems [99]
Brain tissue may be exposed [100] High risk
of bacterial infection [100] Very high
mortality rate [100]
Traumatic
Brain Injuries
(TBI)
Traumatic insult to
the brain [101]
Can cause physical, intellectual, emotional,
social, vocational changes [101] Classified
as primary (direct) or secondary (indirect)
injury [101]
Primary Brain
Injury
Direct injury from the
impact [102]
Result from the initial impact [102]
Secondary
Brain Injury
Indirect injury that
increases primary
injury severity [102]
Caused by cerebral edema, intracranial
hemorrhage, increased ICP, cerebral
ischemia, or infection [102] Hypoxia and
hypotension are common causes [103] Can
occur minutes to days later [105] Result
from blunt or penetrating trauma [106]
Coup-
Contrecoup
Injury
Injury to front of
brain from initial
impact, then rear of
brain from head
movement [106]
Initial impact injures front brain, head
movement injures rear brain [106]
Cerebral
Edema
Swelling of the brain
[107]
May develop hours after injury [107] Low
blood oxygen levels aggravate it [108]
Monitor for seizure activity [109]
Scalp lacerations can be minor or serious [84].
Even small cuts can cause significant blood loss [84].
This is especially true in children [84].
Bleeding can contribute to hypovolemia in patients with multiple injuries
[85].
Skull fractures can result from significant force [86].
They may be open or closed [87].
Penetrating weapons frequently cause skull fractures [88].
Signs include head deformity or a visible crack [88].
Raccoon eyes (ecchymosis under the eyes) and Battle sign (ecchymosis
behind the ear) are signs of skull fracture [88].
Linear skull fractures are the most common [90].
They account for about 80% of skull fractures [90].
They often have no physical signs [91].
Radiographs are needed for diagnosis [91].
Depressed skull fractures result from high-energy trauma with a blunt object
[92].
Frontal and parietal bones are most susceptible [93].
Bony fragments can be driven into the brain [93].
Patients often show signs of neurologic injury [94].
Loss of consciousness is a common sign [94].
Basilar skull fractures are associated with high-energy trauma [95].
They usually follow diffuse impact to the head [95].
These are often extensions of linear fractures [96].
Signs include CSF draining from the ears [98].
Raccoon eyes or Battle signs may also be present [98].
Open skull fractures are often linked to trauma in multiple body systems [99].
Brain tissue may be exposed [100].
This greatly increases the risk of bacterial infection [100].
Open skull fractures have a very high mortality rate [100].
Traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) are defined as traumatic insults to the brain
[101].
They can cause physical, intellectual, emotional, social, and vocational
changes [101].
TBIs are classified into two categories: primary and secondary injury [101].
Primary injuries are the direct result of the impact [102].
Secondary injuries increase the severity of the primary injury [102].
Causes include cerebral edema and intracranial hemorrhage [102].
Increased intracranial pressure (ICP) and cerebral ischemia can also
cause them [102].
Infection is another possible cause [102].
Hypoxia and hypotension are the most common causes of secondary
brain injury [103].
They significantly increase death and disability [104].
Secondary injuries can occur minutes to days after the initial injury [105].
They can result from blunt or penetrating trauma [106].
A coup-contrecoup injury involves injury to both the front and rear of the
brain [106].
Cerebral edema (brain swelling) may develop hours after injury [107].
Low blood oxygen levels make cerebral edema worse [108].
Monitor the patient for seizure activity with any head injury [109].

beneath dura
mater/outside brain,
or within brain
tissues [114]
Epidural
Hematoma
Blood

[120] May or may not
have skull fracture
[120] Associated with
venous bleed [121]
Intracerebral
Hematoma
Bleeding

brain tissue
[124]
Progression of
increased ICP depends
on other injuries, brain
region, and size [126]
High mortality rate [127]
Can follow

rapid deceleration
[124] Many small ones
associated with other
brain injuries [125]
High mortality even

CSF circulates
[127]
Bloody CSF [127] Signs

(neck rigidity,
headache) [127] Sudden
severe headache [129]
Signs of increased ICP

[130]
Often occurs in
subarachnoid space
[127] Causes include
trauma or aneurysm
rupture [128] Sudden
severe cases usually
result in death [131]
Survivors often have
permanent
neurologic
impairment [132]
Accumulation of blood or swelling within the skull can rapidly increase
intracranial pressure (ICP) [109].
Increased ICP squeezes the brain against the skull [110].
Signs of increased ICP include:
Abnormal respiratory patterns (ataxic, Cheyne-Stokes) [111]
Decreased pulse rate [111]
Headache, nausea, vomiting [111]
Decreased alertness [111]
Bradycardia [112]
Sluggish or non-reactive pupils [112]
Cerebral posturing [112]
Increased or widened blood pressures [112]
Cushing's reflex is a triad of symptoms indicating increased ICP [112].
It consists of increased systolic blood pressure, decreased pulse rate,
and irregular respirations [113].
Intracranial hemorrhage is bleeding inside the skull [113].
This usually increases ICP [113].
Bleeding can occur in different locations: between the skull and dura
mater, beneath the dura mater but outside the brain, or within the brain
tissue itself [114].
An epidural hematoma is blood accumulation between the skull and dura
mater [115].
It usually results from a blow to the head causing a linear fracture of the
temporal bone [115].
It is nearly always due to arterial bleeding [115].
Symptoms progress rapidly [115].
The patient often loses consciousness immediately, followed by a brief
lucid interval, then lapses back into unconsciousness [116].
The pupil on the side of the hematoma becomes fixed and dilated [118].
Death occurs rapidly without surgery [118].
A subdural hematoma is blood accumulation beneath the dura mater, outside
the brain [119].
It usually happens after falls or injuries with strong deceleration forces [120]
.
It is more common than epidural hematomas [120].
It may or may not be associated with a skull fracture [120].
It is linked to a venous bleed [121].
Signs typically develop more gradually than with epidural hematomas [121].
The patient often has a fluctuating level of consciousness or slurred
speech [122].
An intracerebral hematoma involves bleeding within the brain itself [124].
It can occur after a penetrating head injury or rapid deceleration forces
[124].
Many small, deep hemorrhages are associated with other brain injuries
[125].
The progression of increased ICP depends on other injuries, the brain
region, and the size of the hemorrhage [126].
Intracerebral hematomas have a high mortality rate [127].
This is true even if the hematoma is surgically removed [127].
A subarachnoid hemorrhage is bleeding in the subarachnoid space [127].
This is where CSF circulates [127].
It results in bloody CSF and signs of meningeal irritation [127].
Neck rigidity or headache are signs of meningeal irritation [127].
Common causes include trauma or a ruptured aneurysm [128].
Patients report a sudden severe headache [129].
As bleeding increases, signs of increased ICP appear [130].
A sudden severe subarachnoid hemorrhage usually results in death [131].
Survivors often have permanent neurologic impairment [132].
7. Concussions and Contusions
A concussion is a blow to the head or face [133].
It is classified as a mild traumatic brain injury [133].
It is a closed injury [134].
There is temporary loss or alteration of brain function [134].
There is no demonstrable physical damage to the brain [134].
About 90% of patients with a concussion do not lose consciousness [135].
A patient may be confused or have amnesia [136].
Retrograde amnesia is the inability to remember events leading up to the
injury [137].
Anterograde amnesia is the inability to remember the events of the injury
[137].
Usually, a concussion lasts only a short time [138].
Ask about symptoms like dizziness, weakness, visual changes, or mood
changes [138].
Additional signs include nausea, vomiting, ringing in the ear, slurred
speech, and inability to focus [139].
Assume a patient with concussion signs has a more serious injury until
proven otherwise [140].
A contusion is bruising of the brain tissue [140].
It results from blunt trauma [140].
A contusion is far more serious than a concussion [141].
It involves physical injury to the brain tissue [142].
It may cause long-lasting or permanent damage [142].
Patients with a brain contusion may show all signs of a brain injury [143].
8. Non-Traumatic Brain Injuries
Brain injuries can also come from medical conditions [144].
These include blood clots or hemorrhages [144].
Problems with blood vessels or high blood pressure can cause spontaneous
bleeding [144].
Signs and symptoms of a non-traumatic injury are often the same as
traumatic brain injury [145].
9. Spinal Injuries: Mechanisms and Findings
The cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine can be injured in many ways [146].
Compression injuries can result from a fall [147].
This is true regardless of how the patient landed [147].
Forces can compress the vertebrae bodies [148].
This can cause disc herniation and compression on the spinal cord [148].
Fragmentation into the spinal canal is possible [148].
Motor vehicle crashes can overextend or hyperflex the cervical spine [149].
This can damage ligaments and joints [149].
Rotation flexion injuries result from rapid acceleration forces [150].
Any unnatural motion can result in a fracture or neurological deficit [151].
Hyperextension occurs when the spine is pulled along its length [152].
This can cause fractures, ligament, and muscle injuries [152].
When spine bones are altered by trauma, they can fracture or move [153].
Permanent damage may occur [154].
Common findings include pain and tenderness on palpation [155].
Take extra precautions when stabilizing the spine if these injuries are
suspected [155].
10. Patient Assessment for Head and Spine Injuries
Step Focus Key Actions
Recognizing
MOI
Identify
mechanisms
suggestive of
head or spinal
injury [156]
Suspect injury in motor vehicle collisions
(especially motorcycles, snowmobiles, ATVs),
pedestrian/vehicle collisions, falls (>20 ft
adult, >10 ft pediatric), blunt trauma,
penetrating trauma to head/back/torso, rapid
deceleration, hangings, axial loading, diving
accidents [156]
Scene Sizeup
Ensure scene
safety and
identify hazards
[157]
Evaluate for hazards [157] Be prepared with
standard precautions [157] Call for ALS early in
MVC [157] Consider the mechanism of injury to
predict likely injuries [158]
Primary
Assessment
Identify and
manage lifethreatening
concerns [160]
Focus on threats to circulation, airway, and
breathing [161] Treat life threats immediately
[161] Recognize critical patients quickly [162]
Reduce on-scene time for critical patients [162]
Increase survival chance or reduce damage for
critical patients [162]
Always suspect a possible head or spinal cord injury with certain mechanisms
of injury [156].
Mechanisms suggesting injury include:
Motor vehicle collisions, especially motorcycles, snowmobiles, and ATVs
[156]
Pedestrian or motor vehicle collisions [156]
Falls greater than 20 feet for adults or 10 feet for pediatrics [156]
Blunt trauma [156]
Penetrating trauma to the head, back, or torso [157]
Rapid deceleration injuries [157]
Hangings [157]
Axial loading injuries [157]
Diving accidents [157]
During scene size-up, ensure the scene is safe [157].
Evaluate the scene for hazards to your health, your team, or bystanders [157].
Use appropriate standard precautions [157].
Call for advanced life support (ALS) as soon as possible in motor vehicle
crashes [157].
Consider how the mechanism of injury might have produced the expected
injuries [158].
The primary assessment focuses on identifying and managing lifethreatening
concerns [160].
Threats to circulation, airway, and breathing are life-threatening [161].
They must be treated immediately [161].
Reducing on-scene time and recognizing critical patients increases survival
chances [162].
This can also reduce irreversible damage [162].
11. Spinal Immobilization Considerations
Be aware that any unnecessary patient movement can cause additional
injuries [163].
Assess the scene first to determine the risk of injury [164].
Form a general impression of the patient based on their level of
consciousness and chief complaint [164].
Consider not using spinal restriction if the patient is clear-thinking [165].
This is also true if they have no neurological deficits or spinal
pain/tenderness [165].
Consider this if there is no evidence of intoxication or other conditions
masking spinal injury [165].
The backboard is rigid and can place the patient in an incorrect position [166].
Circulation to skin areas may be compromised [167].
Some patients may have respiratory compromise laying flat [167].
Minimize the time a patient is on a backboard [167].
Apply a cervical collar after assessing airway and breathing [168].
Provide necessary treatments before applying the collar [168].
Once the cervical collar is on, do not move it unless it causes problems [169].
Problems include difficulty maintaining the airway [169].
Signs of increasing ICP are another reason to remove it [169].
If the device must be removed, maintain manual stabilization of the cervical
spine [170].
Keep manual stabilization until the collar can be replaced [170].
12. Assessing for Signs and Symptoms
Ask the responsive patient specific questions [171].
Ask what happened [171].
Ask where it hurts [171].
Ask if their neck or back hurts [171].
Ask if they can move their hands and feet [171].
Ask if they hit their head [171].
Confused or slurred speech can indicate a head injury [171].
Repetitive questioning or amnesia also suggest head injury in responsive
patients [171].
In trauma, assume a head injury until proven otherwise [172].
Decreased blood glucose levels can mimic these symptoms [173].
Patients with a decreased level of responsiveness should be considered to
have a spinal cord injury [173].
This consideration is based on their chief complaint [173].
13. Airway, Breathing, and Circulation Management
If spinal injury is suspected, open and assess the airway [174].
Manually hold the patient's head still while assessing the airway [175].
Use the jaw-thrust maneuver to open the airway [176].
If jaw-thrust is ineffective, the head-tilt, chin-lift is a last resort [177].
Vomiting can occur in patients with a head injury [178].
Irregular breathing, like Cheyne-Stokes, may result from increased ICP [179].
Administer high flow oxygen to patients with head and spinal injuries [180].
Pulse oximetry values should ideally be 95 or higher [181].
They should not fall below 90 [181].
Avoid hyperventilation (ventilating too fast or with too much force) [182].
Use hyperventilation only when capnography is available [182].
Ensure an end tidal CO2 between 30 to 35 during hyperventilation [182].
A pulse that is too slow in a head injury patient can indicate a serious
condition [183].
A single episode of hypoperfusion can lead to significant brain damage or
death [184].
Assess for signs and symptoms of shock and treat appropriately [184].
Control bleeding [185].
14. Transport Considerations
The manner of transport is important for trauma patients [186].
Keep several transport considerations in mind for head trauma patients [187].
Patients with impaired airways, open head wounds, or abnormal vital signs
may need rapid extrication [187].
Patients who do not respond to painful stimuli also need rapid extrication and
transport [187].
Ensuring a patient's airway is paramount [188].
Providing high flow oxygen is also paramount [188].
There is a probability of vomiting and seizures [189].
Suction should be readily available [189].
A head trauma patient may deteriorate rapidly [190].
They may require air medical transport [191].
In supine patients, the head should be elevated 30 degrees if possible [192].
This helps with ICP [192].
Remember to maintain immobilization of the spine [193].
15. History Taking and Secondary Assessment
Investigate the chief complaint during history taking [194].
Obtain a medical history [194].
Be alert for injury-specific signs and symptoms [194].
Also look for any pertinent negatives [194].
If the patient is not responsive, try to get history from other sources [195].
These include friends, family members, or medical identification [195].
Check cards in wallets [195].
Make every attempt to get a SAMPLE history [196].
In the secondary assessment, the ability to move extremities or feel
sensations does not rule out spinal injury [196].
Absence of pain also does not necessarily rule out spinal injury [196].
Instruct the patient to keep still and not move their head or neck [197].
Perform a physical exam, which can be systematic or focused [198].
Perform a secondary assessment en route if time permits [199].
Obtain a complete set of vital signs [200].
Vital signs are essential in addition to hands-on assessment [200].
Use monitoring devices to quantify oxygen and circulatory status [201].
Maintain end tidal CO2 between 35 and 40 [201].
Maintain an SPO2 above 94 [201].
Use the DCAP-BTLS exam to examine the head, chest, abdomen,
extremities, and back [202].
Check perfusion, motor function, and sensation in all extremities before
moving the patient [202].
A decreased level of consciousness is the most reliable sign of head injury
[203].
Determine if there is decreased movement or numbness/tingling in
extremities [203].
Look for blood or CSF leaking from the ears, mouth, or nose [204].
Also look for bruising around the eyes or behind the ears [204].
Assess pupil size and reaction to light [204].
Continue to monitor the pupils [204].
Do not probe open scalp lacerations with a gloved finger [205].
This may push bone fragments into the brain [205].
Do not remove an impaled object from an open head injury [205].

injury [212]
None specified
Perform a baseline neurologic examination using the Glasgow Coma Scale
(GCS) [206].
If your jurisdiction uses the Revised Trauma Score (RTS), use GCS findings for
RTS [207].
Record levels of consciousness that fluctuate or deteriorate [208].
The GCS categories are shown in a table [208].
Perform a spine exam [209].
Inspect for DCAP-BTLS [209].
Check the extremities for circulation [209].
If impairment is present, note the level [209].
Pain or tenderness on palpation is a warning sign of possible spine injury [210].
Other signs include obvious deformity [211].
Numbness, weakness, or tingling of the extremities are also signs [211].
Soft tissue emergencies in the spinal region may be present [211].
Obvious injuries to the head or neck may indicate injury to the cervical spine
[212].
17. Reassessment and Interventions
Repeat the primary assessment during reassessment [213].
Reassess signs and symptoms and the chief complaint [213].
Recheck the patient's interventions [213].
Reassess the patient's condition at least every five minutes [214].
Rapid deterioration of neurologic signs after a head injury is a sign of
expanding hematoma [215].
It can also indicate rapidly progressing brain swelling [215].
If CSF is present, cover the wound with sterile gauze [216].
This prevents further contamination [216].
Do not bandage it tightly [216].
Your protocol should include administering high-flow O2 [217].
Apply a cervical collar if indicated as part of spinal immobilization [217].
Reassessment should occur as the patient is transported [218].
Transport to an appropriate trauma facility [218].
18. Communication and Documentation
Provide complete and detailed information to the destination facility [219].
Advanced warning helps hospitals prepare for seriously injured patients [220].
Describe the most serious problems found during assessment [220].
More seriously injured patients should be documented [221].
Document their vital signs every five minutes [221].
For more stable patients, document vital signs every 15 minutes [222].
You may be asked to testify as a witness [223].
Be sure to properly document [223].
19. Emergency Care for Head Injuries
There are three general principles for head injury emergency care [225].
These principles protect and maintain critical functions of the central nervous
system [225].
You need to establish an adequate airway [226].
Control bleeding [226].
Provide adequate circulation to maintain cerebral perfusion [226].
Assess the patient's baseline level of consciousness [227].
Continuously monitor the level of consciousness [227].
The most important step is establishing and maintaining an adequate airway
[227].
Once the airway is open, maintain the head and cervical spine in a neutral
inline position [228].
Keep this position until a cervical collar is placed [228].
Also keep this position until the patient is secured on the backboard [228].
Remove any foreign body secretions or vomit from the airway [230].
Check ventilation after clearing the airway [230].
Give supplemental oxygen to any patient with a suspected head injury [231].
This is especially important for anyone having trouble breathing [231].
Use a BVM to assist ventilations if the patient is breathing too slow or shallow
[232].
Placement of an airway device may be necessary [232].
Consider calling for ALS if the patient's airway is compromised [233].
Begin CPR if the patient is in cardiac arrest [234].
Active blood loss can aggravate hypoxia [235].
Bleeding inside the skull may cause ICP to rise to life-threatening levels [235].
Bleeding from a scalp laceration can almost always be controlled with direct
pressure [237].
If a skull fracture is suspected, do not apply excessive pressure to the wound
[238].
If a dressing becomes soaked, do not remove it [239].
Place a second dressing over the first [239].
Shock is usually due to hypovolemia from bleeding from other injuries [240].
Transport immediately to a trauma center [240].
Cushing's triad indicates increased intracranial pressure [241].
It includes increased blood pressure (hypertension) [241].
It also includes decreased heart rate (bradycardia) [241].
Finally, it includes irregular respirations [242].
If Cushing's triad continues, it is fatal [242].
Manage shock [243].
Administer oxygen [243].
Ventilate as necessary [243].
Avoid hyperventilation [243].
20. Emergency Care for Spinal Injuries
Remember to follow standard precautions [245].
Maintain the patient's airway while keeping the spine in the proper position
[245].
Assess respirations and give supplemental oxygen if needed [246].
Manually manage the airway using the jaw thrust maneuver [246].
Consider inserting an OPA [247].
Have a suction unit available [247].
Provide supplemental oxygen if needed [247].
For spinal motion restriction of the cervical spine, immobilize the head and
trunk [248].
This prevents bone fragments from causing further damage [248].
Even small movements can cause significant injury [249].
Never force the head into a neutral position [250].
Do not move the head further if the patient reports certain symptoms [250].
These symptoms include muscle spasms [250].
Increased pain, numbness, tingling, or weakness in arms/legs are also reasons
not to move the head [250].
A compromised airway or ventilations also mean not moving the head [250].
In these situations, stabilize the patient in their current position [250].
21. Spinal Immobilization Devices and Techniques
Cervical collars provide preliminary partial support [251].
They should be applied to every patient with a possible spinal injury [252].
This is based on mechanism of injury, history, or signs/symptoms [252].
A rigid cervical collar must be the correct size to be effective [252].
After manual head/neck stabilization, assess pulse, motor functions, and
sensations in all extremities [253].
Then assess the spinal cord area and neck [253].
Maintain manual support until the patient is fully secured to the backboard or
vacuum mattress [254].
For supine patients, secure the patient to the long backboard [254].
Procedures to move patients from the ground include a four-person log roll
[255].
You may also slide the patient onto the backboard or vacuum mattress [256].
The vacuum mattress is an alternative to the long backboard [257].
It molds to the body contours, reducing pressure points and providing
comfort [257].
It also provides thermal insulation [258].
It is excellent for the elderly or patients with abnormal spinal curvature [259].
Its thickness requires careful movement to maintain C-spine [260].
It cannot be used for patients over 350 pounds [261].
It cannot be used on spine sitting or standing patients [261].
Patients can be moved onto it with a scoop stretcher or log roll [262].
For sitting patients, use a short board or other extrication device [263].
This restricts movement of the cervical and thoracic spine [263].
Then secure the short backboard to the long backboard [263].
Exceptions include dangerous situations requiring immediate access to others
[264].
Another exception is when injuries justify urgent removal [264].
A standing patient should gently sit down [267].
Then transfer them to a position where spinal motion restriction can be
maintained [267].
If mechanism or clinical signs suggest spinal injury, establish spinal motion
restriction [268].
Clinical indications include spinal tenderness or pain [269].
Altered level of consciousness or neurologic deficits are indicators [269].
Obvious anatomic deformity to the spine or high energy trauma in intoxicated
patients are also indicators [269].
Pain may be missed due to shock or attention on other painful areas [270].
Assume spinal injury in all patients with a head injury [270].
This is because manipulating an unstable cervical spine can cause permanent
damage [270].
Use manual inline stabilization or a cervical collar and long backboard [271].
A short backboard is designed to immobilize the head, neck, and torso [274].
It is used for non-critical seated patients with possible spinal injuries [275].
Long backboards provide full body stabilization [276].
They are used to immobilize patients found in any position [277].
22. Helmet Removal
A well-fitting helmet should be left on if it prevents head movement [279].
This is true if there are no airway or breathing problems [279].
It should not interfere with airway/ventilation assessment and treatment
[280].
You must be able to properly immobilize the spine [280].
Remove the helmet if it is a full-face helmet [281].
Remove it if it makes assessing or managing airway problems difficult [281].
Remove it if removing the face guard is not possible to improve airway access
[281].
Remove it if it prevents proper spine immobilization [281].
Also remove it if it allows excessive head movement [282].
Remove the helmet if the patient is in cardiac arrest [282].
The preferred removal method requires at least two people [283].
The technique depends on the helmet type [284].
You and your partner should not move at the same time [285].
Consult medical control about the decision to remove the helmet [285].
An alternate method allows removal with less force [287].
This reduces the likelihood of neck motion [287].
The disadvantage is that it is slightly more time consuming [288].
Steps for the alternate method include removing the chin strap and face mask
[289].
Pop the jaw pads out of place [289].
Place your finger inside the helmet during removal [289].
One person controls the head by holding the jaw and occiput [289].
Insert padding behind the occiput to prevent neck extension [290].
The person at the chest is responsible for ensuring head and neck do not
move [291].
Small children may need extra padding for inline stabilization [292].
23. Review Questions and Conclusion
Review questions cover key concepts from the chapter [294].
The central nervous system parts are cerebrum, cerebellum, brain stem
[294].
Blood loss from scalp lacerations contributes to hypovolemic shock [296].
Immediate loss of consciousness followed by a lucid interval suggests an
epidural hematoma [297].
A patient struck in the head who was briefly unconscious, has a headache
and sees stars, and regained memory has a concussion [298].
No memory of events leading up to an accident is retrograde amnesia [300]
.
Memory of the actual event is anterograde amnesia [302].
A distraction injury to the cervical spine is likely from a hanging
mechanism [303].
Manual stabilization of the head must be maintained until a patient with
possible spinal injury is fully immobilized [304].
For a semi-conscious patient with face and head trauma, blood in the
mouth, and snoring sounds, manually stabilize the head, log roll, and
suction [305].
For an unconscious patient slumped over a steering wheel with head
turned and neck flexed, manually stabilize and move into a neutral inline
position [308].
Do not remove an injured football player's helmet if the face guard can be
easily removed and there's no airway compromise [309].
This concludes the lecture on head and spine injuries [310].
