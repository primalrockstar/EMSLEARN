1. Introduction to Chest Injuries
chest trauma results in over 1.2 million emergency department visits annually
[6].
These injuries can affect the heart, lungs, and great vessels [7].
They can be caused by blunt trauma, penetrating trauma, or both [7].
EMTs must immediately treat any injuries that interfere with normal breathing
[8].
Internal bleeding can accumulate, compressing the heart and lungs [9].
Air can also collect, preventing the lungs from expanding [9].
Trauma Type Description Causes
Blunt Trauma Skin is not broken [46] Generally caused by blunt
force [47]
Penetrating
Trauma
Object penetrates the chest
wall [55]
Object pierces the chest wall
[55]
Both Combination of blunt and
penetrating forces [7]
Can involve both blunt impact
and penetration [7]
2. Anatomy and Physiology of the Chest
ventilation is the body's ability to move air in and out [12].
oxygenation is delivering oxygen to the blood by diffusion [13].
Injuries affecting ventilation and oxygenation are serious and life-threatening
[13].
The thoracic cage extends from the neck to the diaphragm [14].
Penetrating chest injuries can also injure the liver, spleen, or stomach [15].
Striated muscle like intercostal muscles allows for ventilation [17].
intercostal muscles extend between the ribs and allow the chest to expand
[18].
The neurovascular bundle lies along the ribs and can cause significant
bleeding [21].
The pleura covers the lungs and thoracic cavity [23].
Parietal pleura lines the chest wall, and visceral pleura covers the lung [24].
pleural fluid allows lungs to move freely [25].
The ribs connect to the vertebrae and sternum [26].
The trachea divides into bronchi that supply air to the lungs [27].
The thoracic cage contains the heart and great vessels [28].
The mediastinum is the central chest area with the heart, vessels,
esophagus, and trachea [29].
The diaphragm separates the thoracic and abdominal cavities [30].
3. Mechanics of Ventilation and Respiration
intercostal muscles and the diaphragm contract during inhalation [32].
This decreases intrathoracic pressure, creating negative pressure [34].
Negative pressure allows air into the lungs [34].
Muscles relax during exhalation, allowing air out [35].
Spinal cord injuries below C5 may affect intercostal muscles [36].
The diaphragm should still contract with intact phrenic nerves [37].
Spinal injuries at C3 or above can cause complete inability to breathe [37].
tidal volume is the air moved in a single breath, about 500 ml [38].
minute volume is tidal volume multiplied by breaths per minute [40].
Changing tidal or minute volume affects air movement [41].
Bag-mask devices can deliver 1000 to 1500 ml of air [42].
Overventilation can cause gastric distension and impair lung function [43].
Overventilation can also increase intrathoracic pressure, reducing cardiac
output [44].
Measurement Calculation Average Value
Tidal Volume Air moved in one breath ~500 ml [39]
Minute Volume Tidal Volume x Breaths per Minute Affects air movement [41]
4. Types of Chest Injuries: Closed vs. Open
There are two main types: open or closed [45].
In closed chest injuries, the skin is not broken [46].
These are usually caused by blunt trauma [47].
Blunt trauma can cause cardiac contusion and pulmonary contusion [48].
Heart damage can lead to cardiogenic shock [50].
Lung bruising can decrease gas exchange, causing hypoxic and hypercarbic
states [52].
Rib fractures can lacerate lung tissue and vessels, leading to hypovolemic
shock [54].
In an open chest injury, an object penetrates the chest wall [55].
This causes immediate damage, but symptoms can develop over time [55].
Do not remove an impaled object as it may be stopping bleeding [56].
Removing it could cause heavy bleeding and further damage [57].
Blunt trauma can fracture ribs, sternum, chest wall, and damage the aorta [58].
Nearly one-third of car crash fatalities are due to aortic rupture [59].

5. Signs and Symptoms of Chest Injuries
Signs include pain at the injury site [60].
Pain often worsens with breathing [60].
Look for bruising on the chest wall [60].
Crepitus may be felt when touching the chest [60].
Any penetrating injury is a sign [60].
Dyspnea (difficulty breathing) is common [60].
One or both sides of the chest may not expand normally [60].
A rapid weak pulse and low blood pressure can indicate injury [60].
Look for cyanosis around the lips or fingernails [60].
Diminished breath sounds on one side may be present [60].
Low oxygen saturation is a key sign [60].
Patients often have tachypnea (rapid breathing) [61].
Respirations may be shallow due to pain [61].
6. Patient Assessment for Chest Trauma
Begin with scene size-up, ensuring safety and precautions [62].
Do not disturb evidence if it's a crime scene [63].
Request law enforcement for violent scenes [64].
Call for utility, fire, and ALS early if needed [65].
Determine the mechanism of injury, common in crashes, falls, industrial
accidents, and assaults [66].
Determine the number of patients and consider spinal stabilization [68].
Perform a primary assessment, starting with a general impression [69].
Address life-threatening hemorrhage immediately, even before airway [70].
Note the patient's level of consciousness [72].
Perform a rapid physical exam [72].
Assess airway and breathing (A and B) [73].
Ensure a clear and patent airway [75].
Consider early cervical spinal immobilization for blunt trauma [76].
Note jugular vein distension, a sign of pressure on the heart [77].
Determine if breathing is present and adequate [78].
Inspect for DCAP-BTLS (deformities, contusions, abrasions, punctures,
burns, tenderness, lacerations, swelling) [78].
Check for equal chest wall expansion [79].
Look for paradoxical motion, indicating multiple fractured ribs [79].
Apply an occlusive dressing to all penetrating chest injuries [80].
Apply oxygen with a non-rebreather mask at 15 liters [81].
Provide positive pressure ventilation at 100% if breathing is inadequate [81].
Be alert for decreasing oxygen saturation [82].
Watch for signs of impending tension pneumothorax [82].
Assess circulation (C) [73].
Assess pulse presence and adequacy [83].
Consider the patient in shock if the pulse is abnormal or skin is pale, cool, or
clammy [83].
Address life-threatening external bleeding immediately [83].
Make transport decisions, prioritizing those with airway, breathing, or
circulation issues [84].
Pay attention to subtle clues like skin appearance, consciousness, and a
sense of impending doom [84].
When in doubt, transport the patient rapidly [84].
Take history, investigating the chief complaint and mechanism of injury [86].
Identify associated signs, symptoms, and pertinent negatives [86].
Ask about the mechanism, speed, safety equipment, weapon, and number of
wounds [87].
Get a SAMPLE history (Signs, Allergies, Medications, Past medical history,
Last oral intake, Events leading up to injury) [87].
Complete a basic evaluation if time allows [87].
Perform a secondary assessment [88].
For isolated injury, focus on the affected area [89].
Ensure wounds are identified and bleeding is controlled [90].
Locate the extent of the injury and assess underlying systems [90].
Assess the anterior and posterior chest wall [90].
Note changes in the ability to maintain adequate respirations [90].
For significant trauma, perform a rapid physical exam using DCAP-BTLS [91].

7. Vital Signs and Reassessment
Assess pulse, respiration, blood pressure, skin condition, oxygen
saturation, and pupils [92].
Re-evaluate the patient every five minutes or less [93].
A rapid pulse or respiratory rate can indicate hypoxia or blood loss [93].
Increased work of breathing is shown by the use of accessory muscles [94].
Pulse and respiratory rates may decrease in later stages [94].
Reassess by repeating the primary assessment [95].
Reassess the chief complaint [95].
Re-evaluate airway, breathing, pulse, perfusion, and bleeding [95].
8. Management and Interventions for Chest Injuries
Reassess vital signs and observe trends [96].
Provide appropriate spinal immobilization for blunt trauma with suspected
spinal injuries [96].
Maintain an open airway [96].
Control significant visible bleeding [96].
Place a vented chest seal or semi-vented dressing over penetrating trauma
[96].
Provide aggressive treatment for shock [96].
Transport rapidly [96].
Do not delay transport for non-life-saving treatments [97].
These treatments can be performed en route [97].
Communicate all relevant information to the receiving facility staff [97].

9. Specific Chest Injuries: Pneumothorax
Pneumothorax is the accumulation of air in the pleural space [98].
Air enters through a hole in the chest wall or lung surface [99].
Breathing attempts cause the lung on that side to collapse [100].
Blood passing through the collapsed lung is not oxygenated [101].
Diminished breath sounds may occur if the lung collapses significantly [102].
Absent breath sounds may indicate a tension pneumothorax [103].
A sucking sound on inhalation and rushing air on exhalation indicate a
penetrated chest [103].
An open chest wound is called an open pneumothorax or sucking chest
wound [105].
These wounds must be sealed with an occlusive dressing after airway
management and oxygen [106].
A flutter valve is a one-way valve letting air out but not in [107].
Follow local protocols for flutter valves [108].
An occlusive dressing can be taped on three sides to allow air to leak from
one side [109].
Monitor for signs of tension pneumothorax after applying the dressing [110].
If tension pneumothorax develops, open one side of the occlusive dressing
[111].
A simple pneumothorax does not significantly change cardiac physiology
[114].
It's often caused by blunt chest trauma resulting in fractured ribs [114].
Signs include pleuritic pain, dyspnea, tachypnea, accessory muscle use,
decreased oxygen saturation, and subcutaneous emphysema [115].
Late findings can be decreased breath sounds, lethargy, and cyanosis [116].
Pre-hospital treatment involves high flow O2 and monitoring [117].
tension pneumothorax is ongoing air accumulation in the pleural space [118].
Increased pressure causes complete collapse of the uninfected lung [119].
The mediastinum is pushed into the opposite cavity [120].
It's more commonly caused by blunt trauma where a fractured rib lacerates
the lung [120].
Common signs include chest pain, tachycardia, marked respiratory distress,
low oxygen saturation, and absent or decreased lung sounds on the affected
side [121].
Signs of shock, JVD, cyanosis, or tracheal deviation may also be present but
not always [121].
Pre-hospital treatment includes ventilatory support with high flow oxygen [122]
.
Request advanced life support and transport immediately [122].
Needle decompression may be performed by ALS or ED staff [123].

10. Specific Chest Injuries: Hemothorax and Hemopneumothorax
hemothorax is the collection of blood in the pleural space [124].
This blood comes from bleeding around the rib cage, lung, or great vessel [125]
.
When both blood and air are present, it's called a hemopneumothorax [127].
Suspect a hemothorax if the patient shows signs of shock without obvious
external bleeding [128].
Decreased breath sounds on the affected side are also a sign [128].
Bleeding cannot be controlled in the pre-hospital setting [129].
Provide rapid transport to a facility capable of performing surgery [129].
11. Specific Chest Injuries: Cardiac Tamponade
cardiac tamponade occurs when the pericardial sac fills with blood or fluid
[131].
This prevents the heart from pumping enough blood [132].
Fluid buildup compresses the heart's chambers [132].
This dramatically impairs the heart's ability to pump blood [132].
Signs and symptoms are known as beck's triad [133].
Component Description Source
Distended Jugular
Veins
Engorged veins on both sides of the trachea
[133]
[133]
Narrowing Pulse
Pressure
Decreasing difference between systolic and
diastolic BP [133]
[133]
Muffled Heart Tones Heart sounds are difficult to hear [133]
[133]
Pre-hospital care includes supporting ventilations [134].
Rapidly transporting the patient to a facility capable of intervention is crucial
[134].
12. Specific Chest Injuries: Rib Fractures and Flail Chest
Rib fractures are common, especially in older patients [135].
Fractures of the upper four ribs suggest a substantial mechanism of injury
[136].
A fractured rib can lacerate the lung surface [137].
This can cause pneumothorax, tension pneumothorax, hemothorax, or
hemopneumothorax [137].
Patients report localized tenderness and pain when breathing [138].
Pre-hospital treatment includes supplemental oxygen [139].
A flail chest is caused by two or more adjacent fractures in two or more
places [140].
This detaches a segment of the chest wall [140].
The detached segment moves opposite to normal breathing, called
paradoxical motion [141].
paradoxical motion is a late sign [142].
Pre-hospital treatment includes maintaining the airway [143].
Provide respiratory support if needed [144].
Give supplemental oxygen [144].
Perform ongoing assessments for pneumothorax or respiratory complications
[144].
Treatment may include positive pressure ventilation with a bag valve mask
[145].
Restricting chest wall movement with a bulky dressing is no longer
recommended [146].
flail chest may indicate serious internal damage and possible spinal injury [147].
13. Other Chest Injuries
pulmonary contusion should be suspected with a flail chest [148].
Alveoli fill with blood, and fluid accumulates, causing hypoxia [148].
Treatment includes supplemental oxygen and positive pressure ventilations
[149].
Sternal fractures require significant force and may involve lungs, vessels, and
heart [150].
Clavicle fractures can damage the neurovascular bundle [152].
Suspect upper rib fractures with medial clavicle fractures [152].
Be alert for signs of a developing hemothorax [152].
traumatic asphyxia results from severe chest compression [153].
It causes increased pressure in the chest [153].
Characteristics include distended neck veins, cyanosis of face and neck, and
hemorrhage into the sclera [154].
This suggests underlying heart injury and possible pulmonary contusions [155].
Treatment involves ventilatory support with supplemental oxygen and
monitoring during transport [156].
commotio cordis is a blunt injury from a sudden blow to the chest [157].
It occurs during a critical part of the heartbeat [157].
This results in immediate cardiac arrest, often ventricular fibrillation [157].
It is often responsive to defibrillation and early CPR [158].
More common in sports injuries, suspect it in unconscious patients after a
chest blow [159].
Laceration of great vessels can cause massive, rapidly fatal hemorrhage [159]
.
Treatment includes CPR, ventilatory support, immediate transport, and
monitoring for shock [160].

14. Review and Conclusion
Aortic shearing kills almost one-third of patients in rapid deceleration car
crashes [163].
The aorta is the body's largest artery [165].
Shearing from its structures causes rapid bleeding out [166].
Signs of chest injury do not typically include hemoemesis (vomiting blood)
[167].
For an open wound to the chest from a stabbing, the immediate action is to
cover the wound with an occlusive dressing [167].
When caring for a patient with signs of pneumothorax, the most immediate
concern is ventilatory inadequacy [168].
A one-way flutter valve allows air trapped in the pleural space to be released
[169].
Signs of cardiac tamponade include distended jugular veins, narrowing
pulse pressure, and muffled heart tones (beck's triad) [133].
Collapsed jugular veins are not a sign of cardiac tamponade [170].
traumatic asphyxia, characterized by scleral hemorrhage, is also
accompanied by cyanosis to the face and neck [171].
Immediate cardiac arrest in a baseball player hit in the chest is likely
commotio cordis [172].
Paradoxical chest movement is typically seen in patients with a flail chest
[174].
A patient with a large bruise over the sternum and irregular pulse after hitting
a steering wheel is likely to have injured their myocardium (bruised heart
muscle) [175].
