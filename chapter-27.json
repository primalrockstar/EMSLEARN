They can be as serious as life-threatening internal injuries\n[4]. You should not become distracted by dramatic open wounds [5]. Soft tissues can be\ninjured by blunt force, penetrating injury, barotrauma, or burns [5]. Wound care is frequently\nperformed in emergency departments [8]. Most injuries require basic interventions [9]. Death is\noften related to hemorrhage or infection [10]. Infection can be life or limb threatening [11]. This\nis especially true in children, older adults, and people with weakened immune systems [11].\nSimple protective actions can often prevent injuries and complications [12].\n2. Anatomy and Physiology of the Skin\nLayer Description Contents Function Source\nEpidermis Tough external\nlayer, watertight\ncovering [21]\nComposed of\nseveral layers [22]\nForms a watertight\ncovering for the\nbody [21]\n[21]\nDermis Inner layer of\nskin [22]\nHair follicles, sweat\nglands,\nsubcutaneous\nglands [23]\nProvides skin with\nnutrients and\noxygen via blood\nvessels [24]\n[22]\nMucous\nMembranes\nLine body\nopenings [26]\nN/A Provide a\nprotective barrier\nagainst bacterial\ninvasion [26]\n[26]\nThe skin is the body's first line of defense [14]. It protects against external forces and infection\n[14]. It is the largest organ in the body [15]. Skin varies in thickness with age and location [18].\nInjuries can expose blood vessels, nerves, and bones [16]. The EMT must control bleeding and\nprevent contamination [17]. Protecting wounds and applying dressings is important [17]. The\nskin is a barrier against infection [27]. It is also a sensory organ [27]. It assists with body\ntemperature regulation [27]. Skin helps maintain fluid balance [27]. A break in the skin allows\nbacteria to enter [28]. This increases the possibility of infection, fluid loss, and loss of\ntemperature control [28].\n3. Pathophysiology of Wound Healing\nHealing of wounds is a natural process [31]. It involves several overlapping stages [31]. All\nstages aim to maintain homeostasis [31]. Cessation of bleeding is the primary concern [32]. The\nnext stage is inflammation [32]. Additional cells move to the damaged area to begin repair [32].\nWhite blood cells migrate to combat pathogens [33]. Lymphocytes destroy bacteria and\npathogens [34]. Mast cells release histamine [34]. Inflammation removes foreign material and\ndamaged cells [35]. A new layer of cells moves into the region [36]. New blood vessels form to\nbring oxygen and nutrients [37]. Collagen provides stability to damaged tissue [38]. It joins\nwound borders, closing the open tissue [38].\n4. Closed Soft-Tissue Injuries\nType of Injury Cause Characteristics Potential\nComplications\nSource\nContusion Blunt force\ntrauma [39]\nEpidermis intact,\ndamaged dermis\ncells, torn blood\nvessels [40]\nBlue/black\ndiscoloration\n(echomosis) [42]\n[39]\nHematoma Damage to a\nlarge blood\nvessel [44]\nCollection of blood\nin damaged tissues\nor body cavity [43]\nRapid bleeding,\nextensive tissue\ndamage [44]\n[43]\nCrush Injuries Compression of\nsoft tissue [46]\nDamage depends\non force and\nduration [46]\nCirculation cut\noff, tissue\ndestruction [47]\n[46]\nCrush\nSyndrome\nArea trapped for\nlonger than 4\nhours,\ncompromised\narterial flow [48]\nMuscle cells die,\nrelease harmful\nsubstances into\ncirculation [49]\nCardiac arrest,\nrenal failure [50]\n[48]\nCompartment\nSyndrome\nEdema and\nswelling cause\nincreased\npressure [51]\nPressure interferes\nwith circulation,\nnutrient/oxygen\ndelivery impaired\n[52]\nPain (especially\non passive\nmovement),\ntissue death [53]\n[51]\ncontusions result from blunt force trauma [39]. The epidermis remains intact [40]. Cells within\nthe dermis are damaged [40]. Small blood vessels are usually torn [41]. Blood buildup produces\necchymosis [42]. A hematoma is blood collection within damaged tissues [43]. It occurs when a\nlarge blood vessel is damaged [44]. Crush injuries depend on force and duration [46].\nContinued compression cuts off circulation [47]. crush syndrome can develop after prolonged\nentrapment [48]. Damaged muscle cells release harmful substances [49]. compartment\nsyndrome develops from increased pressure within a compartment [51]. This interferes with\ncirculation and oxygen delivery [52]. Severe closed injuries can damage internal organs [56].\nReassess skin color, temperature, and pulses distal to the injury [55].\n5. Open Soft-Tissue Injuries\nType of\nInjury\nCause Characteristics Management/Considerations Source\nAbrasion Friction\nwhen body\npart rubs\nor scrapes\na rough\nsurface [60]\nWound of the\nsuperficial skin\nlayer [60]\nCaused by friction [60]\n[60]\nLaceration Jagged cut\nby sharp\nobject or\nblunt force\n[61]\nTissue is torn\n[61]\nCaused by sharp object or\nblunt force [61]\n[61]\nAvulsion Separates\nlayers of\ntissue [61]\nTissues\nbecome\ncompletely\ndetached or\nhang as a flap\n[61]\nOften significant bleeding,\nreplace flap if possible, never\nremove [62]\n[61]\nAmputation Body part\nis\ncompletely\nsevered\n[64]\nBody part\ncompletely\nsevered [64]\nComplete severance of a body\npart [64]\n[64]\nPenetrating\nWounds\nUsually\nfrom sharp\nobjects or\nprojectiles\n[65]\nSmall entrance\nwounds, little\nexternal\nbleeding,\nforeign material\nmay be present\ndeep inside [65]\nMay damage deep structures,\nrisk of infection, assess\ncarefully [65]\n[65]\nImpaled\nObject\nObject\nremains\nembedded\nin tissue\n[65]\nMay damage\nstructures deep\ninside, foreign\nmaterial present\n[65]\nRemove only if in cheek/mouth\nobstructing airway or in chest\ninterfering with CPR [125]\n[65]\nBlast\nInjuries\nExplosion\n[70]\nOften result in\nmultiple\npenetrating\ninjuries [70]\nMechanism due to blast wave,\nflying debris, or victim being\nthrown [71]\n[70]\nFour types of open wounds are abrasions, lacerations, avulsions, and penetrating wounds [58].\nAn abrasion is a superficial wound from friction [60]. A laceration is a jagged cut from a sharp\nobject or blunt force [61]. An avulsion separates tissue layers [61]. Tissues may be detached or\nhang as a flap [61]. avulsions often have significant bleeding [62]. Replace the flap if possible;\nnever remove it [63]. An amputation is complete severance of a body part [64]. penetrating\nwounds usually have small entrance wounds [65]. They produce little external bleeding [65].\nImpaled objects may damage deep structures [65]. Foreign materials inside tissue can cause\ninfection [66]. Stabbings and shootings often cause multiple penetrating injuries [67]. Assess\npatients carefully to find all wounds [68]. Count penetrating injuries, especially gunshot\nwounds [68]. Blast injuries often result in multiple penetrating injuries [70]. blast injury\nmechanisms include the blast wave, flying debris, and the victim being thrown [71].\n6. Patient Assessment for Soft-Tissue Injuries\nAssessing a closed injury is more difficult than an open injury [75]. Begin with scene size-up\n[75]. Look for indicators of the mechanism of injury [76]. This helps suspect underlying injuries\n[76]. The mechanism of injury provides safety threat information [77]. Use all information to\nevaluate scene safety [78]. Consider if additional resources are needed [78]. Perform a primary\nassessment [79]. Focus on identifying life threats and transport priority [79]. Form your general\nimpression [80]. Look for indicators of the patient's condition seriousness [81]. Assess\nresponsiveness using AVPU [81]. Administer high flow oxygen to patients less than alert [81].\nTreat for potential shock and provide immediate transport [81]. Significant bleeding is an\nimmediate life threat [82]. It must be controlled before opening the airway [82]. If lifethreatening\nexternal bleeding is obvious, control it first [82]. This helps treat for shock [83].\nEnsure the airway is clear and patent [85]. Auscultate for clear breath sounds [85]. Assess for\nequal chest rise [85]. Provide high flow oxygen or assist ventilations if needed [85]. Evaluate\nopen chest wounds for air movement [86]. Consider appropriate transport destination [88].\nPatients needing immediate transport include those with a poor general impression or altered\nlevel of consciousness [89]. Dyspnea, abnormal vital signs, shock, and severe pain also\nindicate immediate transport [89].\nNext, take history [90]. Investigate the chief complaint [90]. Use SAMPLE and OPQRST for\ntrauma patients [90]. Look for DCAP-BTLS during assessments [90]. If the patient is\nunresponsive, get history from another source [91]. Chronic medical conditions can complicate\nopen injuries [92]. Assess interventions and repeat vital signs en route [93]. Assess all\nautonomic regions [94]. Look for jugular vein distension and tracheal deviation in the neck [95].\nCheck the pelvis for stability [96]. Check the abdomen for tenderness, rigidity, and bruising [97]\n. Check extremities and record pulse, motor, and sensory function [98]. Signs of poor perfusion\nindicate rapid transport [99]. These include tachycardia, tachypnea, low blood pressure, and\ncool, pale skin [100]. Conduct reassessment regularly during transport [101]. Repeat the primary\nassessment [101]. Pay attention to areas of concern [101]. Assess the effectiveness of prior\ntreatments [101]. Reassess vital signs and chief complaint [101]. Identify and treat changes in\ncondition [102]. Communicate and document findings for the hospital [102]. Include mechanism\nof injury and patient position [102]. Report estimated blood loss [102]. Include location and\ndescription of wounds treated [102]. Describe the size and depth of the injury [102]. Provide an\naccurate account of treatment [102].\n7. Emergency Care for Closed Soft-Tissue Injuries\nSmall contusions generally require no special emergency care [103]. Note their presence to\ndetermine injury extent [104]. More extensive closed injuries can have significant swelling and\nbleeding [105]. This could lead to hypovolemic shock [105]. Injuries might not show swelling or\nbruising initially [106]. Watch any injury closely while caring for the patient [107]. Treat closed\nsoft tissue injuries using the rice mnemonic [108]. rice stands for Rest, Ice, Compression,\nElevation, and Splinting [108]. Be alert for signs of developing shock [108]. Signs include anxiety,\nchanges in mental status, increased heart rate and respiratory rate [108]. Diaphoresis, cool\nskin, and decreased blood pressure are also signs [108]. If the patient shows signs of shock,\ntreat accordingly and aggressively [109].\n8. Emergency Care for Open Soft-Tissue Injuries\nInjury Type Emergency Care Procedures Source\nGeneral Open\nWounds\nFollow standard precautions, control bleeding with direct\npressure, pressure dressings, splints, or tourniquets; apply\nsterile dressing, do not remove material, flush small wounds\nwith sterile water if no significant bleeding [110]\n[110]\nAbdominal\nWounds\nCover with sterile moistened gauze, secure with occlusive\ndressing, keep organs moist and warm, immediate transport\nto trauma center [120]\n[120]\nImpaled\nObjects\nTreat following skill drill 27-1, remove only if obstructing\nairway in cheek/mouth or interfering with CPR in chest,\nsecure and shorten long objects, provide rapid transport [124]\n[124]\nOpen Neck\nInjuries\nCover with occlusive dressing, apply manual pressure, do not\ncompress both carotid arteries simultaneously, use caution\ndepending on mechanism [130]\n[130]\nAnimal Bites\n(Small)\nConsider contaminated and potentially infected, evaluated\nby physician, major concern for rabies, ensure animal is\nsecured before entering scene [134]\n[134]\nHuman Bites Contains wide range of bacteria/viruses, considered very\nserious if skin penetrated, lacerations by human tooth can\ncause serious infection spread [138]\n[138]\nBites\n(General\nCare)\nApply dry sterile dressing, immobilize area with\nsplint/bandage, transport for surgical cleansing and\nantibiotics [142]\n[142]\nBefore caring for an open wound, follow standard precautions [110]. If life-threatening bleeding\nis seen, apply direct pressure [110]. Control bleeding using direct pressure and elevation [111].\nPressure dressings or splints, and possibly tourniquets can be used [111]. All open wounds are\nassumed contaminated and a risk of infection [112]. Applying a sterile dressing reduces\ncontamination risk [113]. Do not remove material from the open wound [114]. Small wounds\nwithout significant bleeding can be flushed with sterile water [114]. Chemical burns should be\nflushed to remove chemicals [115]. Hospital personnel usually clean open wounds [116].\nSplinting can help control bleeding even without a fracture [117].\nFor abdominal wounds, organs may expose from the wound [118]. This is an evisceration [119].\nCover the wound with sterile, moistened gauze [120]. Secure the gauze with an occlusive\ndressing [121]. Keep the organs moist and warm [122]. Most abdominal wounds require\nimmediate transport to a trauma center [123]. Treat impaled objects following skill drill 27-1 [124]\n. Remove impaled objects only if obstructing the airway in the cheek/mouth or interfering with\nCPR in the chest [125]. Secure and shorten very long objects [126]. Provide rapid transport [126].\nOpen neck injuries can be life-threatening [127]. Open neck veins may suck air in [128]. Air\nentering a blood vessel can block blood flow in the lungs [129]. This can cause cardiac arrest\nfrom an air embolism [129]. Cover the wound with an occlusive dressing [130]. Manually apply\npressure [130]. Do not compress both carotid arteries simultaneously [130]. This could impair\nbrain circulation and cause a stroke [130]. Use caution with neck injury patients depending on\nthe mechanism [131].\nSmall animal bites are heavily contaminated with bacteria [134]. Consider all small animal bites\ncontaminated [134]. All small animal bites should be evaluated by a physician [134]. Rabies is a\nmajor concern [135]. Rabies is a fatal viral infection of the central nervous system [135]. It\naffects all warm-blooded animals [135]. Children may be seriously injured or killed by dogs [136].\nThe animal may attack you [137]. Do not enter the scene until the animal is secured [137].\nHuman mouths contain a wide range of bacteria and viruses [138]. Consider animal bites that\npenetrate the skin very serious [139]. lacerations by a human tooth can cause serious infection\nspread [140]. For bites, apply a dry sterile dressing [142]. Immobilize the area with a splint or\nbandage [142]. Transport to the emergency department for wound cleansing and antibiotics\n[142].\n9. Burns: Types and Pathophysiology\nBurns are among the most serious and painful injuries [143]. A burn occurs when the body\nreceives too much radiant heat [143]. This results in injury [143]. Sources include heat, toxic\nchemicals, or electricity [144]. Always perform a complete assessment [145]. Determine if other\nserious injuries are present [145]. Children, older patients, and those with chronic illness are\nmore likely to experience shock from burns [146]. Burns are soft tissue injuries over a large area\n[147]. They are created by transfer of energy [147]. Energy can be radiation, thermal, or\nelectrical [147]. Thermal burns occur when skin is exposed to temperatures over 111°F [148].\nBurn severity correlates with temperature, concentration of heat energy, and duration of\nexposure [149]. Burn injuries are progressive [150]. Greater heat energy means a deeper wound\n[150]. Exposure time is important [151]. Thermal injury can occur in unresponsive or paralyzed\npatients [151]. The skin barrier is destroyed when a person is burned [153]. Burns create a high\nrisk for infection [153]. Hypothermia, hypovolemia, and shock are also risks [153]. Burns to the\nairway are significant [154]. Loose mucosa in the hypopharynx swells [154]. This leads to\ncomplete airway obstruction [154]. Circumferential chest burns can compromise breathing [155].\nCircumferential extremity burns can lead to compartment syndrome [156]. This results in\nneurovascular compromise and irreversible damage [156]. Call for advanced life support if you\nsuspect complications [156].\n10. Burn Severity and Assessment\nFactor Determining\nSeverity\nDescription Source\nDepth How deep the burn is (superficial, partial thickness,\nfull thickness)\n[157]\nExtent Percentage of total body surface area burned (rule\nof palm, rule of nines)\n[157]\nCritical Areas Involved Face, upper airway, hands, feet, genitalia, over\njoints [157]\n[157]\nPatient Factors Pre-existing medical conditions/injuries, age (under\n5, older than 55) [157]\n[157]\nFive factors determine burn severity [157]. These are depth and extent of the burn [157]. Critical\nareas involved are also important [157]. These include the face, upper airway, hands, feet, or\ngenitalia [157]. Pre-existing medical conditions or injuries matter [157]. Patient age is a factor\n(under five or older than 55) [157]. Burns to the face are important due to potential airway\ninvolvement [158]. Hand, foot, or joint burns are serious due to potential function loss from\nscarring [158].\nThere are three types of burn depth: first, second, and third degree [158]. First degree is\nsuperficial [160]. It involves only the epidermis [161]. The burn site is often painful [162]. A\nsunburn is a first degree burn example [163]. Partial thickness is a second degree burn [164]. It\ninvolves the epidermis and some dermis [165]. These burns do not destroy the skin's entire\nthickness [166]. Subcutaneous tissue is not injured [166]. Skin is typically moist and mottled [167].\nWhite or red blisters are present [167]. Second degree burns can cause intense pain [167]. Full\nthickness or third degree burns extend through all skin layers [168]. They may involve\nsubcutaneous layers, muscle, bone, or internal organs [168]. The burned area is dry and\nleathery [169]. It may appear white, dark brown, or charred [169]. If nerve endings are\ndestroyed, the burned area may have no feeling [170]. Surrounding, less severe areas may be\nvery painful [171]. Significant airway burns are serious [171]. Signs may include singed hair, soot,\nhoarseness, or hypoxia [171]. These patients need rapid transport for advanced airway\nmanagement [171].\nThe extent of burns is important [172]. We calculate extent using the rule of palm or rule of\nnines [173]. The rule of palm estimates surface area using the patient's palm size [174]. A\npatient's palm is roughly one percent of their total body surface [174]. The rule of nines divides\nbody parts into sections [175]. Each section represents approximately nine percent of the total\nbody surface area [175]. Proportions differ in infants, children, and adults [176]. When\ncalculating extent, include only partial and full thickness burns [176]. Document superficial\nburns but do not include them in the estimation [176].\n11. Assessment and Emergency Care for Burns\nWhen assessing a burn, classify it [179]. Classify based on source, depth, and severity [179].\nEnsure the scene is safe [180]. Make sure factors causing the burn are not a hazard [180].\nDetermine the type of burn sustained [181]. The patient's report provides important information\n[181]. Assess the scene for environmental hazards [182]. Determine the number of patients [182].\nCall for additional resources [182]. Consider potential for spinal immobilization or injuries [182].\nBegin the primary assessment with a rapid assessment [183]. Form a general impression [183].\nLook for clues to determine severity [183]. Be suspicious of clues indicating abuse [183].\nConsider the need for manual stabilization [183]. Check responsiveness using AVPU [184].\nAdminister high flow O2 to patients less than alert [184]. Provide immediate transport [184]. For\nairway and breathing, look for singed facial hair or soot [185]. Heavy secretions or coughing\nmay indicate respiratory burn [186]. For circulation, control major bleeding [187]. If obvious lifethreatening\nexternal bleeding exists, control it first [187]. Treat the patient for shock [187]. Treat\nshock in burn patients by preventing heat loss [188]. Cover them with a blanket [188]. Consider\nrapid transport for airway issues or significant burns [189]. Signs of external bleeding also\nrequire rapid transport [189]. Consider rendezvousing with advanced life support [189].\nNext, take history [190]. Investigate the chief complaint [190]. Be alert for signs of other injuries\n[191]. If burned in a confined space, suspect inhalation injuries [191]. Obtain medical history [191].\nBe alert for injury-specific signs and symptoms [191]. Obtain a SAMPLE history [191]. Ask about\ndifficulty breathing or swallowing [191]. Check for an emergency medical identification device\n[191]. The secondary assessment is a physical exam [192]. Assess the patient head to toe using\nDCAP-BTLS [193]. Estimate burn extent using the rule of nines [194]. Determine burn\nclassification and severity [194]. Package the patient for transport based on findings [195].\nObtain vital signs [195]. Use monitoring devices like oxygen saturation and carbon monoxide\nmonitors [195]. Reassess the patient and interventions en route [196]. Communicate and\ndocument findings for the hospital [196]. Describe how the burn occurred [196]. Describe the\nextent, body surface area, depth, and location [196]. Specifically mention and document if\nspecial areas are involved [197].\nYour first responsibility is to stop the burning process [199]. Prevent additional injury [199].\nWhen caring for a burn patient, follow skill drill 27-2 steps [200]. Stop the burning source [206].\nCool the burned area [206]. Remove all jewelry [206]. Maintain a high suspicion for inhalation\ninjuries [207]. Increased exposure time increases damage [207]. Larger burns make the patient\nsusceptible to hypothermia or hypovolemia [207]. Apply a dry sterile dressing to patients with\nlarge surface burns [208].\n12. Specific Types of Burns and Their Management\nType of\nBurn\nCause Characteristics Management Source\nThermal\nBurns\nHeat (scolds,\nopen flames, hot\nobjects, steam,\nflash) [201]\nDepth varies by cause\n(flame often deep,\nscalds common in\nchildren/handicapped,\ncontact rarely deep\nunless trapped) [202]\nStop burning\nsource, cool\nburned area,\nremove jewelry,\nhigh suspicion for\ninhalation injuries,\napply dry sterile\ndressing to large\nburns [206]\n[200]\nInhalation\nBurns\nBurning in\nenclosed spaces\nwithout\nventilation [209]\nUpper airway damage\nfrom superheated\ngases, lower airway\ndamage from\nchemicals/particulate\nmatter [210]\nImmediate\nintervention for\nsevere upper\nairway swelling,\nconsider ALS,\napply cool mist\naerosol/humidified\noxygen, suspect\nCO/cyanide\npoisoning [211]\n[209]\nChemical\nBurns\nToxic substance\ncontact (strong\nacids/alkalis) [220]\nSeverity related to\ntype, concentration,\nduration, eyes\nvulnerable [223]\nEnsure scene\nsafety (wait for\nHazmat), wear\nchemicalresistant\ngloves/eye\nprotection,\nremove dry\nchemicals by\nbrushing, flush\nliquid chemicals\nwith large\namounts of water\n(15-20 min), flush\nburned eyes,\nproperly dispose\nof decon fluid [223]\n[220]\nElectrical\nBurns\nContact with high\nor low voltage\nelectricity [229]\nInjury appears where\nelectricity enters and\nexits the body, large\ndeep tissue injury,\ncardiac/respiratory\narrest risk [234]\nEnsure scene\nsafety, begin\nCPR/AED if\nindicated, provide\nsupplemental\noxygen, monitor\nclosely, apply dry\nsterile dressings,\nsplint suspected\nfractures, prompt\ntransport [233]\n[229]\nTaser\nInjuries\nTaser darts\npuncture skin\n[240]\nBarbs are impaled\nobjects [241]\nTreated as\nimpaled objects,\nremoved by\nphysician\n(sometimes EMT\nper protocol),\npotential\ncomplications\nwith underlying\ndisorders (excited\ndelirium), have\nAED access [241]\n[240]\nRadiation\nBurns\nExposure to\nradioactive\nisotopes/radiation\n(terrorist attacks)\n[245]\nPotential threat from\nalpha (little\npenetration), beta\n(greater penetration),\ngamma (very\npenetrating) radiation\n[246]\nDetermine\nexposure and if\nongoing, wait for\nHazmat for decon,\nremove clothes\nfor most\ncontaminants,\ntreat ABCs once\nno threat, notify\nED, identify\nsource/duration of\nexposure, limit\nduration, increase\ndistance, use\nshielding [252]\n[245]\nThermal burns are caused by heat [201]. Common causes are scolds or open flames [201].\nFlame burns are often deep [202]. Scalds are commonly seen in children and handicapped\nadults [202]. Contact with hot objects causes contact burns [203]. Contact burns are rarely\ndeep unless the patient is trapped [203]. Steam burns can produce topical or scald burns [204].\nFlash burns are produced by an explosion [205]. Lightning strikes can cause a flash burn [205].\nInhalation burns occur when burning is in enclosed spaces [209]. Upper airway damage is from\nsuperheated gases [210]. Lower airway damage is from chemicals or particulate matter [210].\nSevere upper airway swelling may occur [211]. This requires immediate intervention [211].\nConsider requesting advanced life support [212]. Signs of edema include stridor or singed\nnasal hairs [212]. Burns to the face may also be present [212]. Cool mist aerosol or humidified\noxygen can reduce minor edema [213]. Consider carbon monoxide intoxication [215]. Hydrogen\ncyanide is also a concern [217]. Signs involve the central nervous system, respiratory, and\ncardiovascular systems [218]. Pre-hospital treatment includes decon and supportive care [219].\nChemical burns occur when a toxic substance contacts the body [220]. Most are caused by\nstrong acids or alkalis [221]. The eyes are particularly vulnerable [222]. Severity relates to the\nchemical type, concentration, and duration [223]. Ensure you can safely approach the patient\n[223]. You may need to wait for the Hazmat team to decon [224]. Wear appropriate chemicalresistant\ngloves and eye protection [224]. Remove the chemical from the patient first [225]. If\ndry, brush it off before flushing [225]. Remove all clothing and jewelry [225]. Take care not to\ncontact the chemical [226]. The patient should be properly deconned [227]. For liquid chemicals,\nimmediately flush the area with large amounts of water [227]. Continue flushing for 15 to 20\nminutes after burning stops [228]. If eyes are burned, hold the eye open and flood with a gentle\nwater stream [229]. Properly dispose of decon fluid [229].\nElectrical burns result from contact with electricity [229]. High voltage burns can occur from\npower lines [229]. Ordinary household current can cause severe burns and dysrhythmias [229].\nElectricity needs a complete circuit to flow [230]. An insulator prevents a circuit from\ncompleting [231]. A conductor allows current to flow [231]. The human body is a good conductor\n[232]. Electrical burns happen when the body completes a circuit [232]. Type of current,\nmagnitude, and voltage affect seriousness [232]. Your safety is important at electrical scenes\n[233]. A burn appears where electricity enters and exits [234]. Dangers include deep tissue\ninjury and cardiac/respiratory arrest [235]. Management includes starting CPR if indicated [238].\nUse an AED and be prepared to defibrillate [238]. Give supplemental oxygen and monitor\nclosely [238]. Apply dry sterile dressings to burn wounds [239]. Splint suspected fractures [239].\nProvide prompt transport [239].\nTaser injuries involve darts puncturing the skin [240]. Barbs are generally treated as impaled\nobjects [241]. They are removed by a physician [241]. EMTs may remove barbs in some\njurisdictions per protocol [241]. Potential complications exist with underlying disorders [242].\nExcited delirium is commonly associated with illegal drug ingestion [243]. Excited delirium is a\ntrue emergency and warrants advanced life support [243]. Taser use with excited delirium has\nbeen associated with dysrhythmias and cardiac arrest [245]. Have access to an AED when\nresponding to taser patients [245].\nRadiation burns are a potential threat [245]. Incidents relate to radioactive isotopes or terrorist\nattacks [245]. Determine if radiation exposure occurred and if it's ongoing [245]. There are three\ntypes of radiation: alpha, beta, and gamma [246]. Alpha has little penetrating injury [246]. Beta\nhas greater penetrating power [247]. Gamma is very penetrating [249]. It passes through the\nbody and solid materials [249]. Most accidents involve gamma rays or X-rays [250]. People\nexposed to radiation generally don't risk others [251]. In explosions, patients may be\ncontaminated [252]. Maintain a safe distance and wait for Hazmat for decon [252]. Most\ncontaminants are removed by removing clothes [253]. Once no threat exists, treat ABCs [253].\nNotify the emergency department [254]. Identify the source and duration of exposure [254].\nLimit your exposure duration [255]. Increase distance from the source [255]. Attempt to place\nshielding between you and the source [255].\n13. Dressings and Bandages\nDressings and bandages have three functions [256]. They control bleeding [256]. They prevent\nfurther wound damage [256]. They prevent further contamination and infection [256]. Sterile\ndressings are used for most wounds [257]. These include conventional sizes and small\nadhesive dressings [257]. Non-adherent roller dressings are also used [257]. The universal\ndressing is ideal for large open wounds [258]. Gauze pads are appropriate for smaller ones [258]\n. Adhesive dressings are useful for minor wounds [259]. Occlusive dressings prevent air and\nliquids from entering or exiting [259]. They are made from Vaseline gauze, aluminum foil, or\nplastic [260]. They cover sucking chest wounds or abdominal eviscerations [260]. They are also\nused for penetrating back wounds and neck injuries [260].\nTo keep dressings in place, use roller gauze, triangular bandages, tape, or self-adherence [261].\nSelf-adhering soft roller bandages are easiest to use [262]. Adhesive tape holds small\ndressings in place [263]. It helps secure larger dressings [263]. Some people are allergic to\nadhesive tape [264]. Use paper or plastic tape for these individuals [264]. Do not use elastic\nbandages to secure dressings [265]. If the injury swells, the bandage may become a tourniquet\n[265]. This can cause further damage [265]. Always check a limb distal to the bandage [266].\nCheck for signs of impaired circulation and loss of sensation [266]. Air splints and vacuum\nsplints stabilize broken extremities [267]. They can be used with dressings to control bleeding\n[267]. If a wound continues to bleed despite direct pressure, quickly use a tourniquet [268].\n14. Conclusion and Review\nIf a young man is struck in the forearm by a baseball [271]. He complains of pain and has slight\nswelling and ecchymosis [272]. There is no external bleeding [272]. This describes a contusion\n[273]. It is a contusion from blunt force trauma [274]. A severe compression injury cutting off\nblood flow below the injury is compartment syndrome [275].\nA 45-year-old clerk was shot in the right chest [276]. Blood is bubbling from the wound with\nevery breath [277]. The most immediate action is to put an occlusive dressing [278]. This\nprevents air from entering the wound [278]. This is a sucking chest wound [278]. Applying ice to\na hematoma will cause vasoconstriction [279]. This decreases bleeding [279].\nThe primary reason for applying a sterile dressing to an open injury is to control external\nbleeding [281]. While reducing infection risk is important, controlling bleeding is primary [280].\nThe most appropriate way to manage an open abdominal wound with protruding organs is\nusing a moist sterile dressing [282]. Secure it with an occlusive dressing [282]. Do not apply\npressure [283].\nA 22-year-old male is attacked with a knife in his chest [284]. He is not breathing and pulseless\n[284]. If a knife is present and interfering with CPR, carefully remove it [285]. Control the\nbleeding and begin CPR [285].\nSevere burns include full thickness burns involving hands, feet, or genitalia [287]. Burns of more\nthan 10% body surface area are also severe [287]. 5% or more can also be considered severe\n[288].\nA five-year-old boy pulled a barbecue grill on himself [289]. He has partial and full thickness\nburns to his anterior chest and both arms circumferentially [290]. Using the pediatric rule of\nnines, the anterior chest is 9% [292]. Each arm is 9% [292]. This totals 27% [292].\nRegarding chemical burns, it is false to remove a dry chemical after flushing with water [293].\nYou should brush off the dry chemical first, then flush [294].",
