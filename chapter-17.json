Introduction to Cardiovascular Emergencies and the\nCardiovascular System\nCardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in America, accounting\nfor one in three deaths [5].\nEMS plays a crucial role in reducing these deaths [6].\nThis includes promoting healthy lifestyles and early medical care access [6].\nIncreased CPR training for the public is also important [6].\nUtilizing evolving technology in dispatch for cardiac arrest response helps [6].\nPublic access to defibrillation devices is a key factor [6].\nRecognizing the need for advanced life support care is vital [7].\nThe use of cardiac specialty centers is also beneficial [7].\nComponent Function\nHeart Pumps blood to supply oxygen and nutrients to body\ntissues [9]\nAtrium (Upper Chamber) Receives incoming blood [10]\nVentricles (Lower\nChambers)\nPump outgoing blood [10]\nValves Keep blood flowing in the proper direction [12]\nAorta Receives blood from the left ventricle and distributes\nit to arteries [13]\nCoronary Arteries Supply blood to the heart muscle [24]\nArteries Supply oxygenated blood to different body parts [27]\nArterioles/Capillaries Receive blood from arteries, exchange\nnutrients/oxygen for waste [30]\nVenules/Veins Receive blood from capillaries, return oxygen-poor\nblood to heart [31]\nVena Cava Returns oxygen-poor blood to the heart [33]\nRed Blood Cells Carry oxygen and remove carbon dioxide [37]\nWhite Blood Cells Fight infections [38]\nPlatelets Help blood to clot [39]\nPlasma Fluid that carries blood cells [39]\n2. Pathophysiology of Cardiac Conditions\nHeart-related chest pain often results from ischemia, meaning decreased\nblood flow to the heart [53].\nIschemia signifies an inefficient supply of oxygen and nutrients [53].\nIschemic heart disease involves reduced blood flow to heart muscle portions\n[54].\nIf blood flow is not restored, heart tissue will die [54].\nAtherosclerosis is a disorder where calcium and cholesterol form plaque\ninside blood vessels [55].\nThis plaque can completely block a coronary artery or other arteries [56].\nFatty material builds up with age, narrowing the blood vessel lumen [56].\nThe inner artery wall becomes rough and brittle [57].\nA crack in brittle plaque activates the blood clotting system [58].\nThis leads to a blood clot partially or completely blocking the artery [58].\nA thromboembolism is a blood clot floating through a blood vessel [59].\nIf it reaches a narrow area, it stops and blocks blood flow [60].\nTissues downstream of the clot will suffer from hypoxia [60].\nIf blood flow isn't resumed, the tissues will die [61].\nThis sequence is a myocardial infarct, or heart attack [62].\nDeath of heart muscle severely reduces the heart's pumping ability [63].\nCoronary artery disease is the leading cause of death for men and women in\nthe U.S. [64].\nPeak incidence of heart disease is between 45 and 64 years old, but it can\naffect people from teens to 90s [65].\nRisk factors for AMI can be controlled, such as smoking, high blood pressure,\nhigh cholesterol, diabetes, lack of exercise, and obesity [66].\nUncontrollable risk factors include age, family history, race, ethnicity, and\nmale sex [66].\nAcute coronary syndrome describes symptoms from myocardial ischemia\n[67].\nThis includes temporary ischemia causing angina pectoris or the more serious\nacute myocardial infarct [68].\nAngina pectoris occurs when the heart's oxygen need exceeds supply, often\nduring stress [69].\nIt can be a spasm but is usually from atherosclerotic coronary artery disease\n[69].\nAngina can be triggered by a large meal or sudden fear [70].\nPain typically goes away with rest when oxygen demand decreases [70].\nAngina pain is described as crushing, squeezing, or pressure [70].\nIt's often felt in the mid-chest or under the sternum [71].\nPain can radiate to the jaw, arms (often left), back, or epigastrum [72].\nIt usually lasts 3 to 8 minutes, rarely over 15 minutes [73].\nShortness of breath, nausea, or sweating may be associated [74].\nRest, oxygen, or nitro usually relieve it promptly [75].\nAngina is a serious warning sign, though it doesn't usually cause death or\ndamage [75].\nUnstable angina is pain without a specific increase in oxygen demand [76].\nStable angina is pain from exercise or activity increasing heart demand\nbeyond its blood flow capacity [77].\nPatients with chest pain should always be treated as if having an acute\nmyocardial infarct [78].\nAMI pain signals the death of heart cells due to blood flow obstruction [79].\nDead cells become scar tissue and burden the heart [80].\nHeart muscle begins to die about 30 minutes after blood flow is cut off [81].\nHalf the cells may be dead after about two hours [82].\nOver 90 percent of cells may be dead after four to six hours [83].\nOpening the coronary artery with drugs or angioplasty within the first few\nhours can prevent permanent damage [84].\nImmediate transport is essential [84].\nAMI is more likely in the left ventricle [85].\nSigns and symptoms of AMI include sudden weakness, nausea, and\nsweating [86].\nChest pain, discomfort, or pressure, often crushing or squeezing, is common\nand doesn't change with breathing [86].\nPain may be in the jaw, arms, back, abdomen, or neck [86].\nIrregular heartbeat, syncope, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, pink\nfrothy sputum, or sudden death can occur [86].\nAMI pain differs from angina: it may occur at any time (not just with exertion),\ncan last 30 minutes to several hours, and may not be relieved by rest or nitro\n[87].\nNot all AMI patients experience or recognize pain [88].\nA thorough assessment is needed for chest pain complaints [88].\nPhysical findings of AMI include a fearful or nauseated appearance [89].\nPulse can be fast, irregular, or slow (bradycardic) [90].\nBlood pressure can be decreased, normal, or elevated [91].\nRespirations can be normal or rapid and labored [92].\nMental status changes or feelings of impending doom may be present [93].\nDysrhythmias are abnormalities of heart rhythm [94].\nPremature ventricular contractions (PVCs) are extra beats in a damaged\nventricle [95].\nPVCs are usually harmless and common in healthy and sick people [96].\nTachycardia is a rapid heartbeat, 100 beats or more a minute [97].\nBradycardia is a slow heartbeat, 60 beats per minute or less [98].\nVentricular tachycardia is a very rapid heart rhythm, 150 to 200 beats per\nminute [100].\nIt can quickly deteriorate into ventricular fibrillation [101].\nVentricular fibrillation is disorganized, ineffective quivering of the ventricles\n[102].\nNo blood is pumped, and the patient becomes unconscious within seconds\n[102].\nDefibrillation may convert this rhythm [103].\nAsystole is the absence of all electrical activity [109].\nIt usually reflects a long period of ischemia [110].\nNearly all patients with asystole will die [110].\n3. Specific Cardiovascular Emergencies\nCardiogenic shock occurs when body tissues don't get enough oxygen due\nto heart malfunction [111].\nThis is often caused by a heart attack [113].\nThe heart lacks power to pump enough blood through the circulatory system\n[114].\nIt is more common in AMI affecting the inferior and posterior left ventricle [114].\nEarly recognition of shock is important [115].\nCongestive heart failure (CHF) often occurs after an AMI [116].\nCHF develops when the increased heart rate and enlarged left ventricle\ncannot compensate for decreased heart function [116].\nThe lungs become congested with fluid (pulmonary edema) when the heart\nfails to pump effectively [117].\nCHF can occur suddenly or slowly over months [117].\nAcute onset CHF with severe pulmonary edema is usually accompanied by\npink, frothy sputum and severe dyspnea [118].\nWith right-sided heart failure, blood backs up in the vena cava [119].\nThis causes fluid to collect in other body parts, resulting in dependent edema\nlike swollen ankles, feet, and legs [120].\nRight-sided failure can lead to inadequate blood supply to the left ventricle,\ncausing a drop in systemic blood pressure [121].\nPatients may show signs of both left and right-sided heart failure, as leftsided\nfailure often leads to right-sided failure [122].\nHypertensive emergencies involve a systolic blood pressure over 100 mmHg\nor a rapid increase in systolic pressure [123].\nA common sign is a sudden severe headache [124].\nOther symptoms include a strong, bounding pulse, ringing in the ears, nausea,\nvomiting, dizziness, warm skin, nosebleeds, altered mental status, or sudden\npulmonary edema [125].\nUntreated, a hypertensive emergency can lead to a stroke or a dissecting\naortic aneurysm [126].\nPatients should be transported quickly and safely [126].\nAdvanced life support assistance should be considered [127].\nAn aortic aneurysm is a weakness in the aorta wall [128].\nThe aorta dilates at the weakened area, risking rupture [129].\nRupture causes almost immediate death due to blood loss [129].\nUncontrolled hypertension is a primary cause of dissecting aortic aneurysm\n[130].\nA dissecting aneurysm occurs when the aorta's inner lining separates,\nallowing high-pressure blood flow between layers [131].\nSigns include very sudden chest pain in the anterior chest or back between\nthe shoulder blades [132].\nIt may be hard to distinguish from an AMI [133].\nImmediate, safe transport is crucial [133].\nCharacteristic Acute Myocardial Infarct\n(AMI) [134]\nDissecting Aortic Aneurysm\n[135]\nOnset of Pain Gradual, usually slow Abrupt without additional\nsymptoms\nDescription Tightness or pressure Sharp or tearing\nSeverity Increases with time Maximum on onset\n4. Patient Assessment and Emergency Medical Care\nPatient assessment starts with scene size-up to ensure safety and\ndetermine the nature of the illness [136].\nDispatch information, clues, and family/bystander comments help determine\nthe nature of illness [137].\nIn the primary assessment, form a general impression [138].\nIf the patient is unresponsive and not breathing, start CPR and call for an AED\nimmediately [138].\nAssess the patient's airway and breathing [139].\nIf dizziness or fainting occurred due to cardiac compromise, consider spinal\ninjury [139].\nAssess breathing to see if the heart gets adequate oxygen [140].\nIf shortness of breath with no respiratory distress and SpO2 below 95%, give\noxygen at 4 L/min [140].\nIf not improving quickly, use a non-rebreather mask [141].\nIf not breathing or breathing inadequately, use a bag-valve mask with 100%\noxygen [142].\nFor pulmonary edema, use positive pressure ventilations with a BVM or CPAP\n[142].\nAssess circulation: pulse rate and quality, skin color, nature, and temperature,\nand capillary refill [142].\nConsider treating for cardiogenic shock early to reduce the heart's workload\n[143].\nPosition the patient comfortably, usually sitting up and supported [144].\nMake a transport decision based on stabilizing life threats during the primary\nassessment [145].\nMost patients with chest pain need immediate transport [147].\nFollow local protocol for the most appropriate receiving facility [148].\nUse lights or sirens based on estimated transport time [149].\nTransport patients with cardiac problems gently to reduce stress [149].\nHistory taking involves investigating the chief complaint [150].\nConsider all complaints of chest pain, shortness of breath, and dizziness\nseriously [151].\nAsk about dyspnea: is it from exertion, position-related, continuous, or does it\nchange with breathing? [152].\nAsk about cough, sputum production, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, headache, or\npalpitations [152].\nAsk about recent post-trauma [152].\nObtain a SAMPLE history from responsive patients [153].\nAsk if they've had a heart attack, if they have heart problems, or risk factors\nfor coronary artery disease [154].\nAsk about allergies and medications [154].\nUse the OPQRST mnemonic (Onset, Provocation, Palpation, Quality, Region,\nRadiation, Severity, Timing) for pain assessment as part of the SAMPLE\nhistory [154].\nThe secondary assessment focuses on cardiac and respiratory systems,\ncirculation, and respirations for chest pain situations [157].\nMeasure and record vital signs: pulse, respirations, systolic and diastolic\nblood pressure in both arms, and SpO2 with a pulse oximeter [158].\nUse continuous blood pressure monitoring if available [159].\nRepeat vital signs at appropriate intervals and note the time [159].\nA 12-lead ECG tracing is valuable as early as possible for chest pain patients\n[160].\nReassessment involves repeating the primary assessment to check for\nimprovement or deterioration [161].\nReassess vital signs at least every five minutes or with significant changes\n[161].\nSudden cardiac arrest is a risk in cardiovascular emergencies [162].\nHave an AED immediately available if cardiac arrest occurs [162].\nIf no AED, perform CPR until it is available [162].\nReassess interventions and provide transport if not already done [163].\nCommunication and documentation are essential [164].\nAlert the emergency department about the patient's condition and ETA [165].\nFollow medical control instructions and document assessment and treatment\n[165].\nEmergency medical care for chest pain includes ensuring a proper position\nof comfort [168].\nAllow patients to sit up if comfortable [168].\nLoosen tight clothing [168].\nGive oxygen if indicated and continually reassess oxygen saturation and\nrespiratory status [168].\nUse a nasal cannula for mild dyspnea, a non-rebreather for more serious\ndifficulty [170].\nCPAP may be indicated for pulmonary edema [170].\nAssist unconscious patients or those in obvious respiratory distress with\nbreathing [171].\nPrepare to administer low-dose aspirin and assist with prescribed nitro based\non protocol [171].\n5. Medications and Cardiac Monitoring\nAspirin prevents new clots or prevents existing clots from getting bigger [173].\nThe recommended dose is 162 to 324 mg [173].\nLow-dose aspirin is 81 mg [174].\nNitroglycerin (Nitro) is available as a tablet, spray, or skin patch [175].\nNitro relaxes blood vessel wall muscles and dilates coronary arteries [176].\nThis increases blood flow and supply to the heart [176].\nIt also decreases the workload of the heart [177].\nSide effects include decreased blood pressure and severe headache [178].\nContraindications for nitro include systolic blood pressure less than 100\nmmHg [179].\nHead injury is also a contraindication [179].\nUse of erectile dysfunction drugs within 24 to 48 hours is a contraindication\n[179].\nIf the maximum prescribed dose (three doses) has been taken, it is\ncontraindicated [180].\nFor cardiac monitoring to be reliable, electrodes must be placed consistently\n[181].\nBasic principles for best skin contact and minimizing artifact should be\nfollowed [182].\nShaving body hair from the electrode site may be needed [183].\nRub the electrode site with an alcohol swab to remove oils and dead tissue\n[183].\nAttach electrodes to EKG cables before placement [183].\nConfirm correct placement of electrodes on the chest or limbs [183].\nOnce electrodes are in place, switch on the monitor [185].\nPrint a sample rhythm strip to check for artifact [185].\nVerify that electrodes are firmly applied and the cable is plugged correctly\n[186].\n6. Cardiac Surgeries and Assist Devices\nOpen heart surgeries have been performed for decades to bypass damaged\ncoronary arteries [187].\nIn a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), a vessel from the chest or leg is\nsewn from the aorta to the coronary artery beyond the obstruction [188].\nPercutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) dilates the\naffected artery instead of bypassing it [189].\nPTCA involves introducing a long, thin tube with a tiny balloon into a large\nartery [190].\nThe tube is threaded into the narrowed coronary artery and the balloon is\ninflated [191].\nThe balloon is then deflated, and the tube and balloon are removed [192].\nSometimes a stent is placed inside the artery [193].\nPatients with bypass procedures may have a chest scar [194].\nTreat chest pain in patients with these procedures the same as those without\n[195].\nSome people have cardiac pacemakers to maintain regular rhythm and rate\n[196].\nPacemakers are used when the heart's electrical system is damaged [197].\nThese battery-powered devices deliver electrical impulses through wires\ncontacting the myocardium [198].\nThe generator is typically placed under muscle or skin in the upper chest [198].\nEMTs don't normally need to worry about pacemaker problems [199].\nMalfunctioning pacemakers can cause syncope, dizziness, or weakness due\nto a slow heart rate [199].\nThe pulse will usually be less than 60 beats per minute [200].\nPatients with a malfunctioning pacemaker need prompt transport [200].\nAED pads should not be placed directly over a pacemaker [201].\nAutomatic implantable cardiac defibrillators (AICDs) are used in patients\nwho survived cardiac arrest from ventricular fibrillation [202].\nAICDs continuously monitor heart rhythm and deliver shocks when needed\n[202].\nTreat patients with AICDs like any AMI patient, including CPR and AED use if\nthey go into cardiac arrest [203].\nThe AICD's electricity is low and won't affect rescuers [204].\nAn external defibrillator vest has built-in monitoring electrodes and\ndefibrillation pads [205].\nThe vest is worn under clothing and attached to a monitor [206].\nIt uses high-energy shocks similar to an AED [207].\nAvoid contact with the patient if the vest warns of a shock [207].\nThe vest should stay in place during CPR unless it interferes with\ncompressions [208].\nTo remove the device or vest, remove the battery from the monitor, then the\ndevice [209].\nLVADs (left ventricular assist devices) enhance the left ventricle's pumping\nin severe heart failure or after an MI [211].\nMost common LVADs have an internal pump and external battery pack [213].\nPumps are almost always continuous, so most patients won't have a palpable\npulse unless the device malfunctions [214].\nEMTs shouldn't typically deal with LVAD issues directly [215].\nContact medical control if unsure what to do [216].\nTransport all LVAD supplies and battery packs with the patient [216].\n7. Cardiac Arrest and Defibrillation\nCardiac arrest is the complete stop of heart activity, electrical, mechanical, or\nboth [218].\nIt is indicated by the presence or absence of a carotid pulse [219].\nCardiac arrest was nearly always fatal until CPR and external defibrillation in\nthe 1960s [219].\nWith good CPR, early defibrillation, and advanced care access, some patients\ncan survive without neurological damage [220].\nAn Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is a computer that analyzes heart\nelectrical signals [221].\nIt identifies ventricular fibrillation and is highly accurate [223].\nAn AED administers a shock when needed [224].\nAED models require some operator interaction, like applying pads or turning\nthe machine on [225].\nThe operator must push a button to deliver a shock [226].\nMany AEDs use a computer voice to guide the EMT through steps [226].\nMost AEDs are semi-automated and very accurate [226].\nAdvantages of AEDs include quick shock delivery [227].\nThey are easy to operate and don't require advanced life support on scene\n[227].\nRemote adhesive defibrillator pads are safe to use [227].\nLarge pad area with manual paddles makes electricity transmission more\nefficient [227].\nNot all cardiac arrest patients need a shock, but all should be analyzed with\nan AED [228].\nSome rhythms, like asystole (flat line), indicate no electrical activity and don't\nneed a shock [228].\nPulseless electrical activity (PEA) is cardiac arrest with an organized electrical\ncomplex but no pulse; it doesn't need a shock [229].\nEarly defibrillation is essential for cardiac arrest patients [229].\nFew out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients survive without a rapid sequence\nof events [230].\nThese events are the chain of survival links [230].\nAll links must be present for survivability [230].\nThe links are: recognition of early warning signs and calling EMS immediately\n[231].\nImmediate CPR with high-quality chest compressions is crucial [231].\nRapid defibrillation is necessary [232].\nBasic and advanced EMS care is the next link [232].\nAdvanced life support with post-arrest care is vital [232].\nFinally, recovery is the last step [232].\nCPR helps by prolonging the time defibrillation can be effective [234].\nRapid defibrillation has successfully resuscitated many patients [235].\nDefibrillation works best within two minutes of cardiac arrest onset [235].\nNon-traditional first responders are trained to use AEDs [235].\nThe fifth link is advanced life support and post-arrest care [236].\nThis includes continued ventilations at 10 to 12 breaths per minute [237].\nMaintaining oxygen saturation between 94-99% is important [237].\nEnsuring blood pressure is above 90 mmHg is necessary [237].\nTargeted temperature management is used upon hospital arrival [237].\nCardiopulmonary and neurologic support, plus advanced\nassessment/interventions, are included [237].\nThe final link is recovery, which can take a year or longer for survivors [238].\nIntegrating AED and CPR involves working them in sequence [240].\nApply the AED only to pulseless, unresponsive patients [240].\nDo not touch the patient while the AED is analyzing or delivering a shock [240].\nCPR must stop while the AED delivers a shock [240].\nAED maintenance is important [241].\nBecome familiar with the maintenance procedures for your AED brand [242].\nRead the operator's manual [242].\nCommon AED errors include machine failure to shock V-fib [243].\nApplying the AED to a moving or transported patient is an error [243].\nTurning the AED off before analysis or shock is complete is another error [243].\nOperator errors include failing to apply AED pads [244].\nNot pushing analyze or shock buttons when advised is an error [244].\nPushing the power button instead of the shock button is an error [244].\nEnsure the battery is maintained and check equipment daily [244].\nAsk the manufacturer for a checklist of items to check [245].\nReport AED failures to the manufacturer and the FDA [246].\nFollow EMS procedures for notifying these organizations [247].\nMedical direction must approve the written protocol for cardiac arrest care\n[248].\nThe EMT team and medical director should review each AED incident for\nquality improvement [248].\nReview should focus on the speed of defibrillation [250].\nShocks should be delivered within one minute of the call [251].\nMandatory continuing education with skill review is usually required for EMS\nproviders [251].\nEmergency medical care for cardiac arrest involves ensuring AED electricity\ninjures no one [253].\nDo not defibrillate patients in pooled water [254].\nYou can defibrillate a soaking patient, but dry the chest first [255].\nDo not defibrillate patients touching metal that others are touching [255].\nCarefully remove nitro patches from the chest and wipe the area before\ndefibrillation to prevent ignition [256].\nShaving a hairy chest can increase conductivity [257].\nDetermine the nature of illness or mechanism of injury [258].\nSpinal mobilization may be needed for trauma patients during primary\nassessment [258].\nCall for advanced life support assistance for cardiac arrest patients in a tiered\nsystem [258].\nUse a well-organized team approach [258].\nThe AED algorithm guides actions [259].\nIf you witness cardiac arrest, begin CPR with chest compressions [260].\nAttach the AED as soon as it's available [260].\nFollow the skill drill for AED steps and local protocols [260].\nAfter AED protocol, one of three things likely occurs [261].\nA pulse is regained (ROSC - return of spontaneous circulation) [262].\nNo pulse, and the AED advises no shock [263].\nNo pulse, and the AED advises a shock [263].\nIf ALS is responding, stay and continue the shock/CPR sequence [264].\nIf ALS is not responding and protocols allow, begin transport [265].\nTransport if the patient regains a pulse [265].\nTransport after 6-9 shocks or if the AED gives three consistent \"no shock\nadvised\" messages separated by two minutes of CPR [265].\nCardiac arrest during transport: If a pulseless, unconscious patient becomes\npulseless during transport, stop the vehicle immediately [266].\nBegin CPR if the AED isn't immediately ready [267].\nCall for ALS and other resources [268].\nAnalyze the rhythm, deliver a shock if indicated, and immediately resume CPR\n[269].\nContinue resuscitation per local protocol [269].\nIf a conscious chest pain patient becomes unconscious en route, check the\npulse and stop the vehicle [270].\nBegin CPR, analyze the rhythm, deliver a shock, begin chest compressions,\nand continue resuscitation [270].\nTransport to the hospital is included [270].\nCoordinate with ALS personnel per local protocol [271].\nDo not wait for paramedics to arrive if an AED is available [271].\nNotify ALS personnel as soon as possible after recognizing cardiac arrest [272]\n.\nDo not delay defibrillation [272].\nInform paramedics of your actions upon their arrival and interact according to\nlocal protocols [273].\n8. Return of Spontaneous Circulation (ROSC) and Conclusion\nReturn of Spontaneous Circulation (ROSC) is when a pulse is regained [262].\nWhen ROSC is achieved, monitor spontaneous respirations [275].\nProvide oxygen via bag valve mask at 10 breaths per minute [275].\nMaintain oxygen saturation between 95% and 99% [275].\nAssess the patient's blood pressure [275].\nSee if the patient can follow simple commands [276].\nIf advanced life support is not on scene or en route, immediately transport to\nthe closest appropriate hospital based on local protocols [276].",
