Introduction to Human Body Systems\nTerm Definition Importance for Medical\nProfessionals\nAnatomy Focuses on the physical\nstructure of the body and\nits systems [5]\nUnderstanding anatomy is\nimportant [4]\nPhysiology Examines the normal\nfunctions, actions, and\nUnderstanding the roles of\nstructures and system\nactivities of the body and\nits systems [6]\ninteractions in maintaining life\nsupport is important [3]\nPathophysiology Studies the functional\nchanges that accompany a\nparticular disease or\nsyndrome [7]\nDiscussing possible\nconsequences of illness and\ninjury on proper body functioning\nis important [4]\nUnderstanding the human body is important for medical professionals [2].\nThis understanding includes body planes and topographic anatomy [2].\nIdentifying basic structures and functions is also key [3].\nDescribing each body system and its role is necessary [3].\nUnderstanding how systems interact to maintain life is vital [3].\nDiscussing the impact of illness or injury on function is crucial [4].\n2. Topographic Anatomy and Body Planes\ntopographic anatomy applies to the body in the anatomic position [9].\nThe anatomic position is when the body stands facing you [10].\nArms are to the side, and palms face forward [10].\nBody planes are imaginary straight lines that divide the body [11].\nThere are three main body planes [11].\nThe coronal (frontal) plane divides the body's front and back [12].\nThe sagittal (lateral) plane divides the body's left and right sides [13].\nA mid-sagittal (midline) plane is a special sagittal plane [14].\nIt cuts the body in half, leaving equal left and right halves [15].\nA transaxial plane divides the body's top and bottom [15].\n3. Cellular to Systemic Organization\nLevel Composition Forms\nCells Foundation of the human body [18] Tissue [18]\nTissue Cells that share a common function [18] Organs [18]\nOrgans Groups of tissues that perform similar or\ninterrelated jobs [18]\nBody System\n[18]\nBody\nSystem\nOrgans with similar functions working together\n[18]\nHuman Body\nThe human body is organized in a hierarchical manner [17].\nCells are the basic building blocks [18].\nCells with similar functions group together to form tissue [18].\nGroups of tissues performing similar jobs form organs [18].\nOrgans with similar functions work together to form a body system [18].\nUnderstanding this organization is key to understanding the body [19].\n4. The Skeletal System: Structure and Function\nDivision Description Components\nAxial Skeleton Forms the longitudinal axis\nof the body [22]\nSkull, facial bones, thoracic cage,\nvertebral column [22]\nAppendicular\nSkeleton\nComprises the upper and\nlower extremities and their\nconnections [23]\nUpper extremity, pelvis, lower\nextremity [49]\nJoints Occur wherever bones\ncome in contact [25]\nLigaments, cartilage, tendons,\njoint capsule, articular cartilage,\nsynovial membrane [26]\nThe skeletal system gives the body its form [20].\nIt also protects vital internal organs [20].\nThe adult skeletal system has 206 bones [21].\nIt has two major divisions: axial and appendicular [21].\nThe axial skeleton includes the skull down to the coccyx [22].\nThe appendicular skeleton includes the extremities [23].\nThe pelvis includes parts of both divisions [24].\nJoints are where bones meet [25].\nligaments connect bone to bone and stabilize joints [26].\ncartilage cushions bone ends [27].\ntendons attach bone to muscle [28].\nsymphysis joints allow slight movement [29].\njoint capsules hold bone ends together [30].\nArticular cartilage allows bones to glide easily [30].\nsynovial membranes produce fluid for joint movement [31].\nTypes of joints include ball and socket and hinge joints [32].\nThe skull has 28 bones: cranium, facial, and ear bones [36].\nThe cranium protects the brain and has four bones [37].\nThese include the occiput, temporal, parietal, and frontal bones [38].\nFacial bones include the maxilla, zygomas, mandible, orbits, and nasal bones\n[38].\nThe spinal column has 33 vertebrae in five sections [39].\nSections are cervical (7), thoracic (12), lumbar (5), sacrum (5 fused), and\ncoccyx (4 fused) [41].\nVertebrae are connected by ligaments and discs [47].\nThe thorax is formed by thoracic vertebrae and ribs [48].\nIt protects the heart, lungs, esophagus, and great vessels [48].\nThe sternum is in the midline of the chest [48].\nThe upper extremities extend from the shoulder girdle to the fingertips [49].\nThe shoulder girdle includes the clavicle, scapula, and humerus [51].\nThe humerus is the arm's supporting bone [52].\nThe forearm has the radius (thumb side) and ulna (little finger side) [53].\nThe wrist is a modified ball and socket joint [56].\nThe hand has metacarpals and phalanges [56].\nThe pelvic girdle has hip bones, the sacrum, and the coccyx [56].\nEach hip bone has the ilium, ischium, and pubis [56].\nThe pubic symphysis joins the pubic bones [57].\nThe femur is the longest bone in the lower extremity [58].\nThe femoral head connects to the pelvis [59].\nThe knee is a hinge joint connecting the femur to the tibia and fibula [60].\nThe lower leg bones are the tibia and fibula [60].\nThe foot has tarsals, metatarsals, and phalanges [62].\nThe ankle joint is formed by the tibia, fibula, and talus [63].\nThe foot has seven tarsal bones [65].\nThe talus and calcaneus are the largest tarsal bones [65].\nFive metatarsal bones form the foot's substance [66].\nThe toes are formed by 14 phalanges [66].\nThe skeletal system allows movement and stores calcium [67].\nIt also helps create blood cells [67].\nThe musculoskeletal system provides posture and protects organs [68].\n5. The Muscular System: Types and Actions\nThere are three types of muscles: skeletal, smooth, and cardiac [69].\nSkeletal muscle attaches to bones [70].\nIt forms the major muscle mass and is voluntary [70].\nVoluntary muscle is under the brain's direct control [70].\nYou can use skeletal muscle to pick things up [71].\nSmooth muscle and cardiac muscle are involuntary [72].\nThey do not require constant thought to function [72].\nSmooth muscle is in blood vessels and intestines [72].\nCardiac muscle is found in the heart [72].\nContraction and relaxation of skeletal muscle allow movement [74].\nSkeletal muscle contraction also produces heat [75].\nShivering is involuntary muscle action to produce heat [75].\nMuscles also protect underlying structures [75].\n6. The Respiratory System: Anatomy and Physiology\nDivision Components Key Structures\nUpper\nRespiratory\nSystem\nNose, mouth, tongue, jaw,\nlarynx [77]\nPharynx, trachea, epiglottis\n[79]\nLower\nRespiratory\nSystem\nThyroid cartilage, cricoid\ncartilage, cricoid thyroid\nmembrane [79]\nTrachea, carina, main stem\nbronchi, lungs, alveoli [79]\nLungs Held in place by trachea,\narteries, veins, ligaments [80]\nLobes (right has 3, left has\n2), bronchi, bronchioles,\nalveoli [80]\nThe respiratory system is responsible for breathing [76].\nIt exchanges oxygen and carbon dioxide in the lungs [76].\nThe system is divided into upper and lower parts [77].\nThe upper respiratory system includes the nose, mouth, tongue, jaw, and\nlarynx [77].\nThe larynx divides the upper and lower airways [78].\nThe pharynx, trachea, and epiglottis are also in the upper airway [79].\nThe lower airway includes the thyroid cartilage (Adam's apple) [79].\nThe cricoid cartilage and cricoid thyroid membrane are also present [79].\nThe trachea is below the cricoid cartilage [79].\nIt ends at the carina, dividing into bronchi [79].\nBronchi branch into smaller airways within the lungs [79].\nThe lungs are held in place by the trachea and vessels [80].\nEach lung is divided into lobes [80].\nThe right lung has three lobes, and the left has two [80].\nWithin the lobes are bronchi and bronchioles [81].\nThese end at the alveoli, where gas exchange occurs [81].\nalveoli exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide [81].\nPleura are membranes that cover the lungs (visceral) and line the chest wall\n(parietal) [82].\nFluid between the pleura facilitates lung movement [82].\nThe pleural space is a potential space between the pleura [82].\nThe diaphragm is the primary muscle of breathing [83].\nIt contains voluntary and involuntary muscle [83].\nOther muscles aiding breathing include cervical, intercostal, abdominal, and\npectoral muscles [83].\nInhalation is active; the diaphragm and intercostal muscles contract [85].\nThis creates a larger space in the thoracic cavity, and lungs fill [85].\nIt uses negative pressure ventilation [85].\nExhalation is passive; muscles relax [87].\nThe thoracic cavity returns to normal, and air flows out [87].\nThe respiratory system provides oxygen and eliminates carbon dioxide [90].\nVentilation is air movement between lungs and the environment [91].\nRespiration is gas exchange in alveoli and tissues [91].\nOxygen and carbon dioxide move by diffusion [94].\nDiffusion is passive movement from higher to lower concentration [95].\nThe brain stem controls breathing by monitoring carbon dioxide levels [95].\nHigh carbon dioxide causes pH to decrease, stimulating breathing [95].\nThe medulla oblongata initiates ventilation via the phrenic nerve [96].\nThe primary reason for breathing is to lower carbon dioxide [97].\nPatients with chronic lung disease may use a hypoxic drive [99].\nThis is a backup system stimulated by low oxygen levels [100].\nThe pons helps adjust breathing depth during stress [105].\ntidal volume is air moved in a single breath (about 500 mL in adults) [107].\ninspiratory reserve volume is the deepest breath after normal [107].\nexpiratory reserve volume is maximum air forcefully exhaled [107].\nresidual volume is gas remaining after exhalation [108].\ndead space has no alveoli and little gas exchange [108].\nminute volume assesses ventilation adequacy [110].\nminute volume = respiratory rate × tidal volume [111].\nNormal breathing has a regular rate and depth [112].\nIt has a regular rhythm of inhalation and exhalation [112].\nClear breath sounds should be heard on both sides of the chest [112].\nThe chest should rise and fall regularly on both sides [113].\nMovement of the abdomen is also a sign [113].\nInadequate breathing signs include labored breathing [114].\nRates slower than 12 or faster than 20 are inadequate [114].\nMuscle retractions, pale or cyanotic skin, cool damp skin, or tripod position\nare signs [114].\n7. The Circulatory System: Structure and Function\nComponent Description Function\nHeart Involuntary muscle made of\nmyocardium [119]\nPumps blood throughout the body\n[123]\nArteries High pressure vessels [129] Carry oxygenated blood from the\nheart to tissues (except pulmonary\nartery) [129]\nArterioles Smaller branches of arteries\n[135]\nConnect arteries to capillaries [135]\nCapillaries Tiny blood vessels [138] Connect arteries to venules; gas\nand nutrient exchange occurs here\n[138]\nVenules Small veins [138] Connect capillaries to veins [138]\nVeins Oxygen depleted blood going\nback to heart [142]\nCarry deoxygenated blood back to\nthe heart (except pulmonary veins)\n[142]\nBlood Composed of plasma, red\nblood cells, white blood cells,\nplatelets [150]\nTransports oxygen, CO2, waste,\nnutrients; fights infection;\ncoagulates [166]\nThe circulatory system, or cardiovascular system, is a network of tubes [115].\nIt includes arteries, arterioles, capillaries, venules, and veins [115].\nThere are two circuits: systemic and pulmonary [116].\nsystemic circulation carries oxygen-rich blood from the left ventricle to the\nbody and back to the right atrium [116].\nPulmonary circulation carries oxygen-poor blood from the right ventricle to\nthe lungs and back to the left atrium [117].\nThe heart is an involuntary muscle made of myocardium [119].\nIt functions as two paired pumps [121].\nThe left side is a high-pressure pump; the right side is low-pressure [121].\nThe top chambers are atria; the bottom are ventricles [122].\nThe heart receives blood from the aorta via coronary arteries [123].\nThe right side gets deoxygenated blood from body veins [123].\nOxygenated blood returns from the lungs to the left side via pulmonary veins\n[124].\nValves guide blood flow through the heart [124].\nA normal heart rate is 60 to 100 beats per minute [126].\nStroke volume (SV) is the blood moved by one beat [126].\nCardiac output (CO) is the blood moved in one minute [126].\nCO = Heart Rate × SV [126].\nThe heart has an electrical conduction system [127].\nImpulses start at the sinoatrial node and travel through the heart [127].\nThis produces a coordinated pumping action [128].\nArteries are high-pressure vessels carrying blood away from the heart [129].\nThey carry oxygenated blood, except for the pulmonary artery [130].\nThe aorta is the main artery leaving the left heart [131].\nIts branches supply vital organs [132].\nThe pulmonary artery originates at the right ventricle and carries\ndeoxygenated blood to the lungs [134].\nArteries branch into arterioles, which connect to capillaries [135].\nThe pulse is created by blood pumped into major arteries [137].\nIt can be felt at the neck, wrist, and groin [137].\nCapillaries are tiny vessels connecting arteries to venules [138].\nOxygen and nutrients pass through thin capillary walls to tissues [139].\nCapillaries allow blood flow one cell at a time [140].\nVeins carry oxygen-depleted blood back to the heart [142].\nThey have thinner walls and are larger than arteries [142].\nMajor veins include the superior and inferior vena cava [143].\nThe spleen is a solid organ filtering worn-out blood cells and foreign\nsubstances [146].\nThe spleen is highly vascular and susceptible to injury [148].\nBlood is composed of plasma, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets\n[150].\nPlasma is the liquid portion with water, proteins, and nutrients [150].\nRed blood cells (erythrocytes) contain hemoglobin and carry oxygen [150].\nWhite blood cells (leukocytes) fight infection [151].\nPlatelets help form blood clots [152].\nBlood pressure is the force against artery walls [153].\nSystole is when the left ventricle contracts and pumps blood [154].\nDiastole is when the ventricle relaxes and fills with blood [155].\nBlood pressure is measured with a cuff [156].\nIt is expressed in millimeters of mercury [157].\nPerfusion is adequate blood circulation in organs and tissues [158].\nHypoperfusion, or shock, is inadequate blood supply [159].\nThe body can adjust to small blood loss by constricting vessels and\nincreasing heart rate [161].\nLarge blood loss can lead to shock [163].\nMean arterial pressure can help detect shock [164].\nMean arterial pressure = Cardiac Output × SVR [165].\nBlood functions include fighting infection, transporting oxygen/CO2,\ncontrolling pH, transporting waste/nutrients, and coagulation [166].\n8. Nervous System Control of the Cardiovascular System\nThe nervous system controls the cardiovascular system [168].\nThis involves the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems [169].\nThe sympathetic nervous system controls the \"fight or flight\" response [169].\nIt signals adrenal glands to secrete epi and norepi [169].\nThese stimulate the heart and blood vessels [169].\nAlpha adrenergic receptors are in blood vessels and cause contraction when\nstimulated [170].\nBeta adrenergic receptors are in the heart and lungs [170].\nBeta-1 stimulation increases heart rate and contraction force [171].\nBeta-2 stimulation dilates lung bronchi [171].\nThe parasympathetic nervous system causes heart rate to slow and beat\nmore weakly [171].\nIt is nearly the opposite of the sympathetic system [172].\nThe sympathetic and parasympathetic systems usually balance each other\n[172].\nBaroreceptors detect pressure in blood vessels [173].\nThey are found in the aorta and carotid bodies [173].\nBaroreceptor stimulation adjusts blood pressure via the nervous systems [173].\n9. The Nervous System: Central and Peripheral Divisions\nDivision Components Function\nCentral Nervous\nSystem (CNS)\nBrain, Spinal Cord [176] Most complex system; controls\nvoluntary and involuntary\nactions; transmits messages\n[174]\nPeripheral Nervous\nSystem (PNS)\nNerves outside brain and\nspinal cord [176]\nConnects CNS to rest of the\nbody; divided into somatic and\nautonomic [177]\nSomatic Nervous\nSystem (PNS\nsubdivision)\nNerves transmitting\nsignals to voluntary\nmuscles [198]\nRegulates voluntary control\n(walking, talking, writing) [177]\nAutonomic Nervous\nSystem (PNS\nsubdivision)\nInvoluntary nerves\n(sympathetic,\nparasympathetic) [199]\nControls automatic functions\n(smooth muscle, cardiac\nmuscle, fight or flight, rest and\ndigest) [178]\nThe nervous system is perhaps the most complex system [174].\nIt is divided into two main portions [175].\nThe central nervous system (CNS) includes the brain and spinal cord [176].\nThe peripheral nervous system (PNS) includes all nerves outside the brain\nand spinal cord [176].\nThe PNS is divided into the somatic and autonomic nervous systems [177].\nThe somatic nervous system regulates voluntary control [177].\nThe autonomic nervous system controls automatic functions [178].\nThe brain has three parts: cerebrum, cerebellum, and brain stem [180].\nThe cerebrum is the largest part [180].\nIt is responsible for higher brain function [180].\nIt has two hemispheres, each with four lobes [181].\nThese lobes are frontal, parietal, occipital, and temporal [182].\nThe frontal lobe handles personality and judgment [183].\nThe parietal lobe deals with recognition [184].\nThe occipital lobe deals with vision [184].\nThe temporal lobe handles taste, hearing, and understanding words [184].\nThe cerebellum controls balance, coordination, and posture [185].\nThe brain stem controls life-sustaining functions [187].\nThese include cardiac and respiratory functions and consciousness regulation\n[187].\nThe brain stem is comprised of the midbrain, pons, and medulla oblongata\n[188].\nThe reticular activating system regulates consciousness [188].\nCerebral spinal fluid (CSF) filters impurities and cushions the brain/spinal\ncord [190].\nOxygenated blood is supplied to the head by carotid arteries [192].\nDeoxygenated blood drains via jugular veins [192].\nThe spinal cord is an extension of the brain stem [194].\nIt leaves the skull through the foramen magnum [195].\nIt is encased in the vertebral column [195].\nIts main function is to transmit messages between the brain and the body [196]\n.\nThe peripheral nervous system has two parts: voluntary and involuntary [197]\n.\nThe somatic nervous system transmits signals to voluntary muscles [198].\nIt allows activities like walking and writing [198].\nThe autonomic nervous system is involuntary [199].\nIt includes the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions [199].\nThe PNS has sensory and motor nerves [200].\nSensory nerves carry information from the body to the CNS [200].\nMotor nerves carry information from the brain to muscles [200].\n10. The Integumentary System: Layers and Functions\nThe integumentary system is the skin [201].\nIt has two main layers: the epidermis and the dermis [201].\nThe epidermis is the superficial, watertight layer [201].\nIt is like a protective covering [201].\nThe epidermis is composed of layers, including the stratum corneum [202].\nSkin cells in the epidermis are constantly replaced [202].\nThe dermis is the deeper layer [203].\nIt contains special structures of the skin [203].\nThese include sweat glands, sebaceous glands, and hair follicles [203].\nBlood vessels and mucous membranes are also in the dermis [203].\nBelow the skin is the subcutaneous tissue [204].\nThis is a layer of fat [204].\nSubcutaneous tissue serves as an insulator and energy reservoir [204].\nThe skin is the largest single organ [205].\nIt has three major functions [206].\nIt protects the body from the environment [206].\nIt regulates body temperature [206].\nIt transmits information from the environment to the brain [206].\n11. The Digestive System: Organs and Processes\nOrgan Quadrant Location(s) Primary Function\nLiver Upper right, extends into\nupper left [210]\nFilters harmful substances; forms\nclotting factors; stores\nsugar/starch; produces bile [227]\nGallbladder Upper right [210] Stores bile from the liver [228]\nStomach Upper left [211] Receives and stores food; produces\nmovement into the bowel [222]\nSpleen Upper left [211] Filters blood (part of\nlymphatic/circulatory) [147]\nLarge\nIntestines\n(Colon)\nPortions in upper right,\nupper left, right lower,\nlower left [210]\nAbsorbs final 5-10% of digested\nfood/water; forms solid stool [229]\nSmall\nIntestines\nMore than one quadrant\n[214]\nProduce enzymes and mucus to aid\ndigestion [229]\nPancreas Behind the abdominal\ncavity (Retroperitoneal)\n[215]\nSecretes pancreatic juice\n(exocrine); produces insulin and\nglucagon (endocrine) [224]\nKidneys Behind the abdominal\ncavity (Retroperitoneal)\n[215]\nFilter blood waste; control\nwater/salt balance [248]\nUrinary\nBladder\nBehind pubic symphysis in\npelvic cavity [214]\nStores urine [254]\nAppendix Right lower abdomen [230] Opens into the first part of the\nintestines; can become inflamed\n(appendicitis) [230]\nRectum Not specified by quadrant,\nbut large hollow organ\nholding feces [232]\nHolds feces until expelled [232]\nThe digestive system is also called the gastrointestinal system [208].\nIts components include the abdomen, organs, and vascular structures [208].\nThe abdomen contains major organs of digestion and excretion [208].\nThe abdomen is divided into four quadrants [208].\nUpper right: liver, gallbladder, portion of colon [210].\nUpper left: stomach, spleen, portion of colon [211].\nRight lower: portion of large intestines [212].\nLower left: descending and sigmoid colon [213].\nSome organs are in more than one quadrant [214].\nThe kidneys and pancreas are retroperitoneal, behind the abdominal cavity\n[215].\nDigestion begins in the mouth [218].\nThe mouth includes cheeks, lips, gums, teeth, tongue, and palates [218].\nSalivary glands produce saliva [218].\nThe oral pharynx is a tube from the mouth back to the esophagus/trachea\n[219].\nThe esophagus is a tube from the pharynx to the stomach [220].\nMuscles propel food down the esophagus [221].\nThe stomach is a hollow organ in the left upper quadrant [222].\nIt receives, stores, and moves food into the bowel [222].\nThe pancreas is retroperitoneal, below and behind the liver/stomach [223].\nIts exocrine portion secretes pancreatic juice [224].\nIts endocrine portion produces insulin and glucagon [224].\nInsulin is produced in the pancreas [292].\nThe liver is a large, solid organ in the right upper quadrant [225].\nIt filters substances, forms clotting factors, and stores sugar [227].\nBile ducts connect the liver to the intestine and gallbladder [228].\nThe small intestines produce enzymes and mucus for digestion [229].\nThe large intestine includes the cecum, colon, and rectum [229].\nIts main function is absorbing water and forming stool [229].\nThe appendix is a tube in the right lower abdomen [230].\nIt can become inflamed, causing appendicitis [231].\nThe rectum holds feces until expelled through the anus [232].\nSphincters control the escape of contents from the digestive tract [233].\nDigestion is completed by chemical processes using enzymes [235].\nEnzymes break food into sugars, fatty acids, and amino acids [237].\nDigested products are absorbed into the bloodstream and circulated [238].\n12. The Lymphatic System: Components and Role\nThe lymphatic system is important but not talked about much [240].\nIts elements include the spleen, lymph nodes, lymph vessels, and thymus\ngland [241].\nIt supports the circulatory and immune systems [241].\nLymph is a thin fluid that carries oxygen, nutrients, and hormones to cells [241]\n.\nIt also carries waste products away from cells [241].\nLymph vessels form a network throughout the body [241].\nThis network serves as an auxiliary to the circulatory system [241].\nLymph nodes are tiny structures that filter lymph [242].\nThey help rid the body of toxins and harmful materials [242].\n13. The Endocrine System: Hormones and Regulation\nThe endocrine system is a complex message and control system [244].\nIt integrates many body functions [244].\nEndocrine glands release hormones directly into the bloodstream [245].\nEach gland produces one or more hormones [245].\nEach hormone has a specific effect on an organ, tissue, or process [245].\nThe brain controls the release of hormones [246].\nThe system uses feedback loops to maintain body balance [246].\nExcessive or deficient hormone levels can cause diseases like diabetes [247].\n14. The Urinary System: Function and Organs\nThe urinary system controls the discharge of waste filtered from blood [248].\nIts main functions are controlling fluid balance and eliminating waste [249].\nIt also helps control the body's pH [249].\nThe kidneys are two solid organs in the retroperitoneal space [250].\nThey rid blood of toxic waste and control water/salt balance [252].\nThe ureters pass from each kidney to the urinary bladder [253].\nThe urinary bladder is located behind the pubic symphysis [254].\nThe urethra controls urine flow from the bladder out of the body [255].\n15. The Genital System: Reproductive Processes\nThe genital system controls the reproductive processes [256].\nThe male reproductive system includes testes, epididymis, vas deferens,\nprostate gland, seminal vesicles, and penis [257].\nIt lies mostly outside the pelvic cavity [257].\nThe female reproductive system includes ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus,\ncervix, and vagina [258].\nIt is contained entirely within the pelvic cavity [259].\n16. The Life Support Chain and Metabolism\nCells are the body's foundation and require oxygen, nutrients, and waste\nremoval [260].\nThe respiratory and circulatory systems deliver these supplies [260].\nInterference with these systems can damage and kill cells [260].\nCells use oxygen and nutrients to create chemical energy through\nmetabolism [261].\nAerobic metabolism uses oxygen to create energy (ATP) [262].\nWhen oxygen is limited, cells switch to anaerobic metabolism [262].\nAnaerobic metabolism produces lactic acid as a waste product [263].\nAccumulation of lactic acid and waste makes the area toxic [263].\nThis can eventually lead to cell death [263].\nMovement of oxygen, waste, and nutrients occurs by diffusion [264].\npH is critical to diffusion [264].\nThe body uses significant energy to maintain normal pH [264].\n17. Pathophysiology: Respiratory Compromise and Shock\nCondition Definition Causes Effects\nRespiratory\nCompromise\nInability of\nthe body to\nmove gas\neffectively\n[265]\nBlocked airway,\ndamaged breathing\nmuscles, obstructive\nairway (asthma,\noverdose, trauma,\nHypoxia (decreased\noxygen),\nhypercarbia\n(elevated carbon\ndioxide), increased\nallergic reaction), change\nin atmosphere, impaired\ngas movement,\nventilation/perfusion\nmismatch [267]\nrespiratory rate\n(attempt to\ncompensate), blood\nbecomes acidotic,\ndecreased blood\noxygen, shift to\nanaerobic\nmetabolism, cell\ndamage/death [266]\nShock\n(Hypoperfusion)\nInadequate\nblood flow\nand oxygen\nto organs\nand tissues\n[159]\nLarge blood loss\n(systemic adjustment\nfails), impaired oxygen\ndelivery [163]\nCellular hypoxia,\nanaerobic\nmetabolism, lactic\nacid production,\norgan dysfunction,\ndecreased blood\npressure, increased\nheart rate, forceful\nheartbeats, blood\nvessel contraction,\ninterstitial fluid\nmoves into\ncapillaries [275]\nPathophysiology studies functional changes in disease [265].\nRespiratory compromise is the inability to effectively move gas [265].\nIt can lead to hypoxia (low oxygen) or hypercarbia (high carbon dioxide) [266]\n.\nCauses include blocked or obstructed airways [267].\nDamaged breathing muscles can also cause it [267].\nTrauma, allergic reactions, and high altitudes are causes [267].\nImpaired gas movement across membranes is a cause [267].\nA ventilation/perfusion mismatch occurs when gas movement or blood flow\nis abnormal [268].\nPulmonary emboli or fluid in alveoli cause mismatches [269].\nRespiratory compromise causes oxygen levels to fall and carbon dioxide to\nrise [270].\nThe brain increases the respiratory rate to compensate [270].\nIf ineffective, blood becomes more acidotic [271].\nDecreased oxygen forces cells into anaerobic metabolism [273].\nThis leads to shock, inadequate blood flow and oxygen [274].\nImpaired oxygen delivery causes cellular hypoxia [275].\nHypoxia leads to anaerobic metabolism and lactic acid production [275].\nThis results in organ dysfunction [275].\nThe effects of shock are similar to respiratory compromise [278].\nOxygen supplied to tissues fails [278].\nCells switch to anaerobic metabolism and produce lactic acid [278].\nBaroreceptors detect decreased blood pressure [279].\nThey initiate the release of epi and norepi [279].\nThis increases heart rate and contraction force [280].\nBlood vessels contract, and fluid moves into capillaries [280].\nAnaerobic metabolism requires more energy than aerobic [282].\nIt can result in metabolic acidosis [281].\nThere is decreased ability of blood to carry oxygen [283].\nBrain cells cannot use alternative fuels [284].\nDecreased glucose can damage and kill brain cells [284].\nCellular injury can be repairable if perfusion is restored [285].\nIrreversible injury means no treatment will help [285].\n18. Review of Key Concepts\nWhich is found in the retroperitoneal space? The kidneys [287].\nThe cartilaginous tip of the sternum is called the xiphoid process [290].\nA person with bilateral femur fractures has both femurs fractured [291].\nThe most prominent landmark on the anterior neck surface is the Adam's\napple, also called the thyroid cartilage [291].\nInsulin is produced in the pancreas [292].\ntendons connect muscle to bone [293].\nligaments connect bone to bone [293].\nThe normal resting heart rate in an adult is 60 to 100 beats per minute [294].\nBradycardia is below 60; tachycardia is above 100 [295].\nThe left atrium receives oxygenated blood from the lungs [296].\nThe largest part of the brain is the cerebrum [297].\nWhite blood cells, not red blood cells, help fight infection [299].",
