Levels of EMS Providers\nLevel Training\nHours\nKey Capabilities\nEMR\n(Emergency\nMedical\nResponder) [18]\nVery basic\ntraining [18]\nProvides care before ambulance arrival [19].\nMay assist with the ambulance [19]. Initiates\nimmediate care and assists EMTs [55]. Focuses\non immediate BLS and urgent care with limited\nequipment [56].\nEMT\n(Emergency\nMedical\nTechnician) [20]\nAbout 150 to\n200 hours [57]\nBasic training in life support (BLS) [20]. Includes\nautomatic external defibrillation (AEDs) [20].\nIncludes airway adjuncts [20]. Assists with\ncertain medications [20]. Possesses knowledge\nand skills for basic emergency care [58].\nAssumes responsibility for assessment, care,\npackaging, and transport [59].\nAEMT\n(Advanced\nEmergency\nMedical\nTechnician) [21]\nAdds to EMT\ntraining [61]\nTraining in specific aspects of advanced life\nsupport [21]. Includes IV access therapy [21].\nIncludes administration of a limited number of\nemergency medicines [21]. Includes advanced\nairway adjuncts [61].\nParamedic [22] 1,000 to more\nthan 1,300\nhours [64]\nExtensive advanced life support training [22].\nIncludes endotracheal intubation [23]. Includes\nemergency pharmacology [23]. Includes\ncardiac monitoring [23]. Includes other\nadvanced assessment and treatment skills [23].\nTraining may be in an associate\u0027s or bachelor\u0027s\ndegree program [65].\n4. Components of the EMS System\nThe EMS Agenda 2050 outlines five components of the EMS system [68].\nThese components include comprehensive, quality and convenient care [69].\nEvidence-based clinical care is another component [69].\nEfficient, well-rounded care is also included [69].\nPreventative care is a key part [69].\nComprehensive and easily accessible patient records are essential [69].\nPublic access ensures easy access to help in an emergency [70].\nThe 911 system is part of public safety [71].\nAn emergency medical dispatch (EMD) system helps dispatchers give\nmedical instructions [72].\nMobile apps can alert lay people trained in CPR to cardiac arrests [73].\nHuman resources focuses on the people who deliver care [74].\nThe EMS Agenda 2050 encourages an environment where talented people\nwant to work [75].\nMedical direction is provided by a physician [76].\nThe medical director authorizes EMTs to provide care in the field [76].\nmedical directors are liaisons between the medical community and EMTs [77].\nAppropriate care is described in standing orders and protocols [77].\nprotocols are a comprehensive guide for the EMT\u0027s scope of practice [78].\nstanding orders are part of protocols [78].\nThey designate what the EMT must do for a specific complaint [78].\nProviders do not need to consult medical direction before implementing\nstanding orders [79].\nMedical control can be offline (indirect) or online (direct) [80].\nOffline control involves standing orders, training, or supervision [80].\nOnline control is a physician\u0027s direct order over the phone or radio [81].\nLegislation and regulation ensure training, protocols, and practices follow\nstate laws [82].\nA senior EMS official manages administrative tasks and daily operations [83].\nIntegration of healthcare services means pre-hospital care continues in the\nemergency department [84].\nMobile integrated healthcare (MIH) uses the pre-hospital spectrum for\nhealthcare delivery [85].\nMIH evolved to improve access to affordable healthcare [85].\nHealthcare in the MIH model is provided in the community [86].\nThis is done by an integrated team of professionals [86].\nThis branch uses additional training levels for EMS providers [87].\nThis includes community paramedicine [88].\nExperienced paramedics receive advanced training for community services\n[88].\nThey can perform health evaluations and monitor chronic illnesses [89].\nThey can obtain lab samples and administer immunizations [89].\nInformation systems use computer systems to document patient care [90].\nElectronically stored information is used to improve care [90].\nEvaluation means the medical director is responsible for quality control [91].\nAdopting a just culture promotes fairness and accountability [92].\ncontinuous quality improvement (cqi) reviews and audits the EMS system\n[93].\nCQI identifies areas for improvement and assigns remedial training [94].\nMinimizing errors is the goal of CQI [95].\nIt uses a plan, do, study, act cycle [95].\nPatient safety involves minimizing medical errors [95].\nThis requires efforts from both the EMS agency and personnel [96].\nSystem finance varies depending on the organization [97].\nPersonnel can be paid, volunteer, or a mix [98].\nEMTs may gather insurance information or secure signatures on hipaa notices\n[99].\nThey may obtain permission to bill health insurance [99].\nThe ET3 pilot program reimburses EMS for appropriate patient care [100].\nIt sets up payment for transport to alternative destinations [101].\nIt also covers on-scene treatment with no transport [101].\nEducation systems involve licensed instructors in most states [102].\nTraining programs must follow national standards from CoAEMSP and\nCAAHEP [103].\nContinuing education and refresher courses maintain and update EMT skills\n[105].\nPrevention and public education focus on public health [106].\nPublic health examines the population\u0027s health needs [106].\nThe goal is preventing health problems [106].\nEMS works with public health agencies in two ways [107].\nPrimary prevention strategies prevent events from happening [107].\nExamples include pool safety education and car seat installation [107].\nSecondary prevention occurs after an event [108].\nIt aims to decrease the effects of the event [109].\nHelmets and seat belts are examples of secondary prevention [109].\nExamples of public health accomplishments include vaccination programs and\nseat belt laws [110].\n5. Roles and Responsibilities of an EMT\nEMTs are healthcare professionals [116].\nRoles include keeping vehicles and equipment ready [117].\nEnsuring safety is crucial: self, partner, patient, bystanders [117].\nBeing familiar with emergency vehicle operation is needed [117].\nEMTs should be on-scene leaders [117].\nThey perform an evaluation of the scene [117].\nCalling for additional resources when needed is a role [117].\nGaining access to patients is necessary [117].\nPerforming a patient assessment is a key task [117].\nGiving emergency medical care while awaiting resources is essential [117].\nAdministrative support is also required [117].\nConstant professional development is important [118].\nCultivating and sustaining community relations is a role [118].\nGiving back to the profession is encouraged [118].\nProfessional attributes include integrity, acting consistently and honestly\n[119].\nEmpathy involves being aware of others\u0027 needs [121].\nSelf-motivation means solving problems without direction [121].\nAppearance and hygiene project trust and professionalism [121].\nSelf-confidence is knowing what you know and don\u0027t know [121].\nBeing able to ask for help is part of self-confidence [121].\nTime management involves performing or delegating tasks efficiently [122].\nCommunication means understanding and being understood [122].\nTeamwork and diplomacy involve working with others and respecting them\n[122].\nRespect is holding others in high regard [122].\nPatient advocacy keeps the patient\u0027s needs central to care [123].\nCareful delivery of care means paying attention to details [123].\nIt ensures care is done as safely as possible [123].\nEvery patient is entitled to compassion and respect [124].\nEMTs are bound by patient confidentiality [125].\nPatient privacy must be protected [125].\nFindings or disclosures should only be discussed with treating personnel [126].\nLimited disclosures may be made as required by law, like to the police [126].\nProtection of patient privacy is highlighted by hipaa [127].\n6. Licensure and Certification Requirements\nSuccessful completion of the EMT course allows taking national or state\ncertification exams [11].\nAfter passing the certification exam, one is eligible for state licensure [12].\nLicensure is how the state ensures an applicant\u0027s competency [13].\nThis process allows states to manage who can be a healthcare provider [14].\nLicensure requirements differ by state but generally include [27]:\nA high school diploma or equivalent [27].\nProof of immunization [27].\nSuccessful background check and drug screening [27].\nA valid driver\u0027s license [27].\nSuccessful completion of a recognized BLS CPR course [28].\nSuccessful completion of a state-approved EMT course [28].\nSuccessful completion of state-recognized written and practical exams\n[28].\nDemonstrating necessary mental and physical abilities [28].\nCompliance with other state, local, and employer provisions [28].\nThe americans with disabilities act (ada) protects people with disabilities\n[29].\nIt prevents denial of access to state or local government programs [30].\nIt prohibits employers from denying equal employment to the disabled [31].\nTitle 1 protects EMTs with disabilities seeking employment [32].\nEmployers may need to adjust processes or modify the work environment [33].\nPersonal background information is checked based on state criminal\nrequirements [34].\nStates have requirements prohibiting individuals with misdemeanors or\nfelonies from becoming EMS providers [35].\n7. Quality Improvement and Patient Safety\nThe EMT has a role in the quality improvement process [2].\nThe medical director is responsible for maintaining quality control [91].\nThis involves adopting a just culture [92].\nA just culture promotes a learning culture [92].\nIt balances fairness and accountability [92].\ncontinuous quality improvement (cqi) involves reviews and audits [93].\nCQI identifies areas for improvement and assigns remedial training [94].\nThe goal of CQI is minimizing errors [95].\nIt uses a plan, do, study, act cycle [95].\nPatient safety aims to minimize medical errors [95].\nErrors can result from rules-based, knowledge-based, or skills-based failures\n[95].\nMinimizing errors requires efforts from both the EMS agency and personnel\n[96].\n8. Research and Evidence-Based Decision-Making\nAn EMT has an impact on research and evidence-based decision-making\n[5].\nEMS research helps determine the shape and impact of EMS on the\ncommunity [112].\nevidence-based medicine focuses on procedures proven useful for\nimproving patient outcomes [113].\nMany ems systems consult national model EMS clinical guidelines [114].\nThese guidelines are from the National Association of EMS Officials [114].\nThe guidelines are based on a review of current research and expert\nconsensus [115].",

Review of Key Concepts A\n1. Prioritizing EMT Well-being\nAspect of Wellbeing\nDescription Source\nRecognizing\nHazards\nEMTs must identify potential threats to their\nhealth, safety, and well-being.\n[3]\nCoping with\nStress\nManaging both physical and mental stress is\ncrucial.\n[2]\nAssisting\nEmotional Aspects\nHelping patients and families with the\nemotional impact of illness, injury, or death is\npart of the role.\n[2]\nEnsuring Personal\nSafety\nTaking preventative actions is important.\n[2]\nDealing with\nSensitivity\nInteracting with patients and co-workers\nrequires sensitivity.\n[2]\nProper\nPrecautions\nUsing appropriate measures for infectious\ndiseases is essential.\n[2]\nPreventing Injuries Avoiding on-the-job injuries is a priority.\n[2]\nTo effectively care for others, emergency medical technicians (EMTs) must prioritize\ntheir own well-being [2]. Recognizing hazards to health, safety, and well-being is very\nimportant [3]. These hazards include personal neglect, environmental threats, humanmade\nthreats, and mental and physical stress [4]. The emotional well-being of an\nemployee and the patient are intertwined, especially in high-stress rescues [5].\nwellness is the active pursuit of a good state of health [10]. resilience is the capacity\nto cope with and recover from distress [11].\n2. Strategies for Enhancing Resilience and Managing Stress\nPractices that can help increase resilience include eating healthy and maintaining a\nwell-balanced diet [12]. Ensuring a minimum of seven to nine hours of sleep is also\nimportant [12]. Strengthening positive relationships with family and friends can build\nresilience [12]. Building relationships with peers and colleagues is also recommended\n[12]. Incorporating daily stretching, movement, and exercise helps [12]. Building habits\nof mindfulness and positivity contributes to resilience [12].\nStrategies can be used to manage stress [13]. Minimizing or eliminating stressors as\nmuch as possible is helpful [14]. Changing partners to avoid negative personalities or\nchanging work hours can reduce stress [15]. Cutting back on overtime might also be\nan option [15]. Changing your attitude about the stressor can make a difference [16].\nTalking about feelings with people you trust is important [16]. Seeking professional\ncounseling is an option if needed [17]. Do not obsess over frustrating situations that\nare unable to change [18]. Focus on delivering high-quality care [18]. Adopting a\nphilosophical outlook can be beneficial [19]. Expanding your social support system\nbeyond co-workers helps manage stress [20]. Developing friends and interests\noutside of emergency services is recommended [20]. Limiting the intake of caffeine,\nalcohol, and tobacco use is also advised [20].\n3. Nutrition, Exercise, and Sleep for EMTs\nHealth\nAspect\nRecommendations Consequences of\nNeglect\nSource\nNutrition\nand Fluids\nEat regular, well-balanced\nmeals; Limit sugar, fat, sodium,\nand alcohol; Consume complex\ncarbohydrates for long-term\nenergy; Maintain adequate fluid\nintake, preferably water.\nObesity, cardiac\ndisease, other\nlong-term health\nproblems from\nexcessive fat\nintake.\n[21]\nExercise\nand\nRelaxation\nRegular exercise enhances\nnutrition and hydration benefits;\nHandle stress more easily when\nin good physical condition;\nEngage in at least 30 minutes of\nmoderate or vigorous activity\n5+ days/week; Include\ncardiovascular endurance,\nmuscle strength, and flexibility.\nHandling stress\nbecomes more\ndifficult.\n[25]\nSleep Adults need 7-9 hours of sleep;\nWork shifts shorter than 24\nhours; Access to caffeine and\nopportunity to nap on duty;\nEducation and training on\nfatigue mitigation; 20-30\nminute naps or rest breaks\nduring shifts; Increase physical\nactivity; Be careful about\ncaffeine; Engage in mental\nexercise; Avoid caffeine,\nnicotine, chemicals 4+ hours\nbefore bed; Ensure dark, quiet,\ncool sleep environment;\nMedical errors,\nvehicle crashes,\nharm to patients,\nbystanders, other\nEMS providers\n(short-term);\nHypertension,\nsleep apnea,\nrespiratory issues,\ndiabetes,\ndepression, other\nmedical conditions\n(long-term);\nIncreased stress.\n[28]\nExercise early but allow time to\nrelax; Nap early and avoid\nheavy pre-sleep meals; Balance\nfluid intake; Establish calming\npre-sleep routine; Sleep when\ntruly tired; Keep sleep schedule\nconsistent; Expose to natural\nlight during waking hours.\nEating regular, well-balanced meals is important [21]. Limit consumption of sugar, fat,\nsodium, and alcohol [21]. complex carbohydrates like pasta and rice are reliable for\nlong-term energy [22]. Fats can lead to obesity and cardiac disease if eaten too much\n[23]. Maintaining adequate fluid intake is crucial [24]. Water is generally the best fuel\navailable [24].\nRegular exercise enhances good nutrition and hydration [25]. Being in good physical\ncondition makes handling stress easier [26]. Engage in at least 30 minutes of\nmoderate or vigorous activity at least five days per week [27]. Include cardiovascular\nendurance, muscle strength building, and muscle flexibility [27].\nAdults should sleep a minimum of seven to nine hours [28]. Half of EMS personnel get\nless than six hours of sleep [29]. They report severe mental and physical fatigue [29].\nShort-term effects of sleep deprivation include medical errors and vehicle crashes\n[30]. Long-term effects include hypertension, sleep apnea, and diabetes [31].\nIncreased stress contributes to sleep deprivation and fatigue [31]. Guidelines for\nfatigue management have been developed [32]. EMS personnel should work shifts\nshorter than 24 hours [35]. They should have access to caffeine and opportunity to\nnap [36]. Education and training can help mitigate fatigue [38]. Recommendations to\ncombat fatigue include adequate sleep and taking 20 to 30 minute naps [39]. Increase\nphysical activity and be careful about caffeine consumption [39]. Engage in mental\nexercise [39]. To improve sleep quality, avoid caffeine, nicotine, and other chemicals\nbefore bed [40]. Ensure your sleep environment is dark, quiet, and cool [41]. Exercise\nearly but relax before trying to sleep [41]. Nap early and avoid heavy pre-sleep meals\n[41]. Balance fluid intake and establish a calming pre-sleep routine [41]. Sleep when\ntruly tired and keep your schedule consistent [41]. Expose yourself to natural light\nduring waking hours [41].\n4. Disease Prevention and Health Promotion\nDisease prevention focuses on medical care and prevention to avoid or reduce\ndisease effects [42]. health promotion focuses on personal practices and social habits\nto improve health [43]. Smoking, vaping, or chewing nicotine can lead to\ncardiovascular and respiratory disease [44]. Smokeless tobacco is associated with\ncancers of the throat, mouth, and pancreas [45]. Vaping has been shown to cause\ncardiovascular and respiratory illness [46]. Strategies for quitting nicotine include\ncreating a plan and setting a quit date [47]. Tell a friend, family, or co-worker your plan\n[47]. Remove tobacco and vaping products from your surroundings [47]. Talk to your\ndoctor about resources that can help you quit [47].\nAn acceptable amount of alcohol is one drink per day for women and two for men [48]\n. Excessive alcohol use causes about 88,000 deaths per year in the United States [49]\n. It also costs more than $200 billion per year [49]. Approximately 75 percent of the\ncost is due to binge drinking [50]. Excessive alcohol use can adversely affect\ncardiovascular, hepatic, immune, and central nervous systems [50]. It may increase\nthe risk of developing certain cancers [50].\nBoth prescription and illegal drugs may be abused or misused [51]. According to the\nCDC, drug abuse costs the United States more than 190 billion dollars annually [52].\nMany EMS agencies drug test their employees [53]. Balancing work, family, and health\nis important [53]. When possible, rotate your schedule to give yourself time off [53].\nYou need to take vaccinations [54]. If the stress of work is too much, seek help [54].\n5. Infectious and Communicable Diseases: Risks and Prevention\nTerm Definition Source\nPathogen A microorganism capable of causing\ndisease.\n[60]\nContamination Presence of an infectious organism or\nforeign body on or within objects, wounds,\nor a patient\u0027s body.\n[61]\nExposure Contact with blood, body fluids, tissues, or\nairborne particles that may allow disease\ntransmission.\n[61]\nPersonal Protective\nEquipment (PPE)\nProtective equipment worn by an individual\nto prevent exposure to a pathogen or\nhazardous material.\n[62]\nAn infectious disease is caused by organisms within the body [55]. A communicable\ndisease can be spread from person to person or from one species to another [56].\nInfection is a risk for EMTs [57]. Infection risk can be minimized by immunizations,\nprotective techniques, and hand washing [58].\nRoutes of transmission include direct contact and indirect contact like a needle stick\n[63]. Airborne transmission occurs through sneezing [63]. Foodborne transmission is\nfrom contaminated food [63]. vector-borne transmission is via a flea or mosquito [63].\nOSHA develops, publishes, and enforces guidelines for reducing workplace hazards\n[64]. All EMTs are trained in handling blood-borne pathogens [65]. The CDC has\ndeveloped standard precautions for healthcare workers [66]. standard precautions\nprevent contact with objects, blood, body fluids, and other potential risks [67].\nAssume every person is potentially infected [68]. Apply infection control procedures\nto reduce infection [68]. OSHA refers to this as universal precautions [69]. Notify your\ndesignated officer if you are exposed [70].\ndonning and doffing full PPE in a consistent sequence is essential [71]. Common\ncomponents of PPE include a mask, eyewear, face shield, gloves, and a gown [72].\nProper hand washing is the simplest and most effective way to control disease\ntransmission [73]. Wash hands before and after patient contact, even if you wear\ngloves [74]. Wear gloves if there is any possibility of exposure to blood or body fluids\n[75]. Vinyl, nitrile, and latex gloves are effective [76]. Wear heavy-duty gloves when\ncleaning the ambulance [77]. Change gloves between patients [77]. Removing gloves\nrequires a technique to avoid self-contamination [78].\nEye protection prevents blood splatters [79]. Prescription glasses are not adequate\n[79]. Goggles or a face shield are best [79]. Gowns provide protection for extensive\nblood splatter [80]. They may be worn during aerosolized generating procedures or\nmajor trauma [80]. Wear a standard surgical mask for fluid splatter [81]. Place a surgical\nmask on a patient [81]. Wear a particulate air respirator like an N95 if an airborne\ndisease is suspected [81]. Protective eyewear using safety glasses with side shields,\ngoggles, or a face shield is also needed [81]. If a patient needs oxygen, use a nonrebreathing\nmask instead of a surgical mask [82]. Particulate air respirators must\ncomply with OSHA guidelines and be fit tested [83].\nMouth-to-mouth or mouth-to-mask resuscitation is recommended during active\ncommunity spread of an airborne virus [85]. Bag-valve ventilation is an aerosolgenerating\nprocedure and should be avoided in epidemic scenarios like COVID-19 [86]\n. Proper use and disposal of sharps help avoid exposure to HIV and hepatitis [87]. Do\nnot recap, break, or bend needles [88]. Dispose of used sharps in an approved,\nclosed, and rigid container [89].\n6. Employer Responsibilities and Immunity\nThe risk of being exposed to a communicable disease is a job hazard [90]. You should\nfollow OSHA and other national guidelines to reduce exposure risk [91]. Know and\nfollow your department\u0027s infection control plan [92]. Cleaning and decontaminating\nthe ambulance and equipment is important [93]. Clean the ambulance after each use\nand daily whenever possible [94]. Cleaning should ideally be done at the hospital [95].\nRemove medical waste and place it in a red biohazard bag [97]. Dispose of it at the\nhospital [97]. Contaminated equipment left at the hospital should be cleaned by staff\nor bagged for transport [98]. Use a bleach water solution at a 1 to 10 dilution to clean\nthe unit [99]. Remove contaminated linen and place it in the appropriate bag [100].\nReusable equipment should be cleaned and sterilized per department procedure [101].\nEven if germs reach you, you are not necessarily at risk of infection [102]. Immunity is\na major factor in determining who gets sick [103]. You can be immune or resistant to\nparticular germs [104]. Immunity means having been immunized or vaccinated and\nable to recover from an infection [105]. A history of childhood infectious diseases\nshould be recorded [106]. This includes chickenpox, mumps, measles, rubella, and\nwhooping cough [107]. The CDC recommends several immunizations for healthcare\nworkers [108]. Hepatitis B is required by OSHA [108]. Yearly influenza vaccination is\nrecommended [108]. MMR and varicella vaccines are also recommended [108]. The\nTdap shot is recommended every 10 years [108]. Skin tests for tuberculosis are\nrecommended prior to hire and annually [109].\nFor general post-exposure management, turn over patient care to another provider if\nexposed to blood or body fluids [110]. Clean the exposed area with soap and water\n[110]. If eyes were exposed, rinse them for 20 minutes [110]. Activate your department\u0027s\ninfection control plan [111]. Complete an exposure report [112]. Be screened to\ndetermine significant exposure to a bloodborne pathogen [112]. You may be required\nto quarantine if exposed to a highly communicable disease without proper PPE [112].\nPost-exposure prophylactics and treatment are available for significant exposure [113].\n7. Scene Safety Protocols\nHazard Protective Measures Source\nHazardous\nMaterials\nRead labels/placards from a distance; Call a\nhazardous material team; Do not care for patients\nuntil moved and decontaminated; Remain upwind and\nuphill; Keep distance; Contact dispatch for additional\nresponse; Do not enter until instructed.\n[117]\nElectricity Mark off a danger zone around downed lines (one\nspan of power poles); Do not approach downed wires\nor anything in contact with them; Avoid high ground\nduring lightning; Stay away from drainage ditches,\nmoist areas, small depressions, and wet ropes during\nlightning; Become the smallest target possible; Drop\nall equipment.\n[126]\nFire Be aware of smoke, oxygen deficiency, high\ntemperatures, toxic gases, building collapse risk,\nequipment, or explosions.\n[135]\nVehicle\nCrashes\nUse sufficient proper protective gear; Be aware of\ntraffic, unstable vehicles, downed power lines,\nviolence risk, airbags, fluids, and sharp objects.\n[136]\nPersonal safety is very important in an emergency situation [114]. Safety begins with\nprotecting yourself as soon as you are dispatched [114]. Wear your seatbelt and don\nappropriate PPE [114]. Continue to protect yourself once on scene [115]. Make sure the\nscene is well marked [115]. Place warning devices to alert other motorists [115]. Park at\na safe distance from the scene [115]. Ensure there are plenty of lights if it is dark [116].\nWear reflective clothing in dark scenes [116].\nUpon arrival at a scene with potential hazardous materials, read labels, placards, and\nidentification numbers from a distance [117]. A specially trained hazardous material\nteam will handle disposal or patient removal [118]. Do not begin caring for patients\nuntil they are moved and decontaminated [119]. Do not enter the scene unless it is\nsafe to do so [120]. The U.S. Department of Transportation ERG lists common hazard\nmaterials and procedures [122]. Smartphone and tablet apps are also available [123].\nGeneral guidelines for hazmat scenes include not entering the scene if there is\nevidence of a hazmat [123]. Remain upwind and uphill from the scene [124]. Keep your\ndistance [124]. Quickly contact dispatch and request additional responses [124]. Do not\nenter the scene until instructed by trained responders [125].\nDealing with downed power lines is beyond EMT training [127]. Mark off a danger zone\naround the downed lines until poles are secured [128]. This safety zone is one span of\nthe power poles\u0027 distance [128]. Do not approach a downed wire or touch anything it\ncontacts [129]. Lightning is a threat from a direct hit or a ground current [130]. A repeat\nlightning strike can occur in the same area [132]. Avoid high ground to minimize direct\nlightning strike risk [132]. To avoid ground current injury, stay away from drainage\nditches, moist areas, and wet ropes [133]. Become the smallest target possible and\ndrop all equipment [134].\nCommon hazards at a fire include smoke, oxygen deficiency, and high temperatures\n[135]. Toxic gases, building collapse, equipment, or explosions are also hazards [135].\nVehicle crashes are common events [136]. Hazards at vehicle crashes include traffic,\nunstable vehicles, and downed power lines [136]. Risk of violence, airbags, and fluid\nand sharp objects are also present [137]. Use sufficient proper protective gear to\nreduce risk [137].\n8. Managing Violence on Scenes\nViolence on scenes includes assaults, hostile situations, riots, or disturbances [138]. A\nscene assessment should begin while en route [138]. Once on scene, continue\nassessment using observation and information from other responders [138]. Maintain\npersonal safety and the safety of your team [138]. Mass violence situations may\ninvolve several agencies [139]. Know who is in command [139]. Remain vigilant for\npotential violence at all times [139]. Allow law enforcement to secure the scene before\napproaching scenes involving projectiles [139]. Find protection [139].\nTwo types of protection exist [140]. cover is the use of impenetrable barriers for\nprotection [140]. concealment is hiding behind objects to limit visibility [141]. If the\nevent is a crime scene, attempt to maintain the chain of evidence [142]. Do not disturb\nthe scene unless absolutely necessary for patient treatment [143]. The rate of\nviolence-related injuries for emergency responders is 22 times higher than for other\nemployees [143]. Recommendations for preventing violence include training in\nidentifying potential violence scenes [144]. Training in de-escalation strategies and\ntechniques is recommended [144]. Practice ongoing scene assessments [144].\nDispatch identification and alerting of past or potential threats is important [144].\nRecommendations for protection against violence include training in self-defense and\nescape techniques [145]. Training in physical and chemical restraint techniques is also\nrecommended [145]. Fitting and use of body armor is advised [145]. Training and\npractice in operations with law enforcement is crucial [145].\n9. Protective Clothing and Gear\nType of\nProtective\nClothing/Gear\nPurpose Source\nCold Weather\nGear\nPulls moisture away from skin (inner layer);\nServes as insulation (middle layer); Resists\nwind, rain, sleet, snow (outer layer).\n[149]\nTurnout Gear\n(Bunker Gear)\nProtects firefighters from heat, fire, sparks, and\nflashover.\n[152]\nGloves Protect from heat, cold, and cuts; May reduce\ndexterity.\n[153]\nHelmets Protection anytime working in a fall zone;\nShould provide top and side protection; Secure\nchin strap; Not well suited for rescue situations;\nHelmet with chin strap and face shield for\nelectrical hazards.\n[154]\nBoots Water resistant, fit well, flexible; Steel-toed\npreferred; Traction important for rescue.\n[158]\nEye Protection Protects from blood splatters; Eyeglasses with\nside shields for routine care and when tools are\nused; Use face shield and goggles when\nappropriate.\n[160]\nEar Protection Soft foam industrial type ear plugs.\n[161]\nSkin Protection Protects against sunburn; Use sunscreen with\nminimum 15 SPF.\n[162]\nBody Armor\n(Bulletproof Vests)\nRanges from lightweight to heavy; May not be\npractical for everyday use; Costly; Do not\nprotect against rifle ammunition or stabbing.\n[164]\nWearing protective clothing and other appropriate gear is critical to personal safety\n[146]. Become familiar with the protective equipment available to you [147]. Inspect\nyour clothing and wear your gear regularly, ideally before reaching the scene [148].\nMany EMS services have restricted policies regarding hair, rings, and jewelry [166]. Tie\nhair up neatly [167]. Limit the number of rings worn [167]. Wear only a watch on your\nwrist [168].\n10. Caring for Critically Ill and Injured Patients\nA patient needs to know who you are and what you are doing [168]. Let the patient\nknow you are attending to their immediate needs [169]. Avoid making unprofessional\ncomments during resuscitation [169]. Treat all patients with dignity and respect [169].\nTechniques for communicating with critical patients include avoiding sad and grim\ncomments [170]. Such remarks may increase the patient\u0027s anxiety [170]. Orient the\npatient to their surroundings using brief statements [170]. Be honest, deciding how\nmuch information the patient can understand [170]. Allow the patient to be part of the\ncare being given [171]. Allow for hope if there is a slight chance [171]. Locate and notify\nfamily members [171]. Assure the patient that you will take care of notifying\nappropriate people [171].\nCritically injured children should be cared for as any adult [172]. It is important that a\nrelative or responsible adult accompany the child [173]. This helps relieve anxiety and\nassists in care [173].\n11. Coping with Death and Dying\nThe death of a child is a tragic and dreaded event [175]. Help the family through the\ninitial period of death [176]. Acknowledge death in a private place [177]. Shock, denial,\nand disbelief are common emotions [178]. If circumstances allow, let the parents hold\nthe child [179]. Use your best judgment to determine if this is appropriate [180]. Let the\nfamily\u0027s actions be your guide [181]. The family may want to see the child, and you\nshould allow them to do so [182]. Prepare the parents for what they will see [183]. Do\nnot overload the grieving parents with information [184].\nDeath is likely to be either sudden or after a prolonged terminal illness [186]. The EMT\nwill sometimes face death [187]. The grieving process has stages [188]. The first stages\ninclude denial, anger, hostility, bargaining, depression, or acceptance [189]. What can\nthe EMT do? You can ask the patient and family if there is anything you can do to\nhelp [190]. Reinforce the reality of the situation [190]. Be honest with death and dying\n[191]. Do not say you know how the patient or family feels [192]. Let the patient or\nfamily members grieve in their own way [193].\n12. Stress Management for EMTs\nPhysiological Manifestations of Stress\nIncreased respirations and Heart rate [198]\nIncreased blood vessels dilated [198]\nVessels near the skin surface dilated [198]\nPupils tense [198]\nMuscles increase blood glucose levels [198]\nPerspiration [198]\nDecreases blood flow to the gastrointestinal tract [199]\nEMS is a high-stress job [195]. It is important to know the causes of stress and ways\nto deal with them [196]. Stressors include emotional, physical, and environmental\nsituations [196]. There are general adaptation syndromes [197]. The alarm response\noccurs first [197]. Then there is reaction and resistance to stress [197]. Finally, there is\nrecovery or exhaustion [197].\nSituations stressful for EMS providers include dangerous situations [200]. Physical or\npsychological demands are also stressors [200]. Critically ill or injured patients are\nstressful [200]. Dead or dying patients can be overpowering [200]. Sight, smells, and\nsounds can cause stress [200]. Multiple patient situations are stressful [200]. Angry or\nupset patients, families, or bystanders contribute to stress [200]. The unpredictability\nand demands of EMS cause stressful situations [200].\nThere are different stress reactions [201]. An acute reaction can occur during the\nevent [201]. A delayed reaction manifests after the stressful event [202]. Cumulative\nstress is prolonged or excessive stress [202]. Physical symptoms of stress include\nfatigue and changes in appetite [202]. GI problems, headaches, and insomnia are also\nsymptoms [202]. Irritability and inability to concentrate can occur [202]. Hyperactivity\nor underactivity can be physical symptoms [202]. Physiological symptoms include fear\nand depression [203]. Guilt, oversensitivity, anger, and frustration are also symptoms\n[203].\n13. Critical Incident Stress and Burnout\nCritical incident stress is brought about by acute, severe stressors [204]. These can\ninclude mass casualty incidents [205]. Serious injury or traumatic death of a child can\ncause this stress [205]. Crashes with injuries caused by an emergency provider are\nalso critical incidents [205]. Death or serious injury of a co-worker in the line of duty is\na severe stressor [205]. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may develop after a\ndistressing event [206]. It is characterized by re-experiencing the event [206]. Overresponding\nto stimuli recalled from the event is also a characteristic [206].\nCritical Incident Stress Management (CISM) helps providers relieve stress [207]. This\ncan occur formally or at an ongoing scene [207]. Trained CISM professionals facilitate\ndiffusing sessions [208]. Diffusing sessions are held during or immediately after the\nevent [208]. Debriefing sessions are held 24 to 72 hours after the event [208]. An\nimportant rule is not to turn the debriefing into an operational critique [209]. If CISM is\nnot an option, private counseling by a mental health professional may be preferred\n[210].\nBurnout describes a combination of exhaustion, cynicism, and poor performance [211].\nIt results from long-term job stress [211]. Burnout affects the well-being of the EMT\nand their colleagues and patients [212]. It can result in increased major medical errors\n[212]. Increased rates of healthcare-associated infection can occur [212]. Increased\npatient mortality is also a possible effect [212]. It contributes to decreases in work\nmorale and overall work effort [213]. Effective teamwork and patient satisfaction can\ndecrease [213]. Burnout can lead to an increase in job turnover [213].\nCompassion fatigue is common among healthcare providers [214]. It is also known as\nsecondary stress disorder [214]. It is characterized by a gradual lessening of\ncompassion over time [214]. Symptoms include high absenteeism and difficult\nrelationships with colleagues [215]. Inability to work in teams and aggressive behavior\ntowards patients are symptoms [215]. Strong negative attitudes towards work and\nlack of empathy for patients can occur [215]. A judgmental attitude towards patients\nand preoccupation with non-work issues are also symptoms [215]. Other symptoms of\nincreased stress are present [215].\nThe suicide rate among emergency responders is higher than the rest of the\npopulation [216]. Job stress is widely considered the largest contributing factor to\nsuicide [217]. Several organizations and mental health services are available to provide\nemotional support [218].\n14. Emotional Aspects of Emergency Care and Workplace Issues\nEven experienced healthcare providers sometimes have difficulty overcoming\npersonal reactions [218]. The struggle to remain calm in horrible circumstances\ncontributes to emotional stress [219]. In stressful situations, exercise extreme\nprofessional care in both words and actions [219]. Factors influencing a patient\u0027s\nreaction to stress include socioeconomic background and fear of medical personnel\n[219]. Alcohol or substance abuse disorders and a history of chronic stress also play a\nrole [219]. Mental disorders, reaction to medication, age, and nutritional status are\nfactors [219]. Feelings of guilt and past experiences with illness or injury also influence\nreactions [219]. Quickly and calmly assess the actions of the patient, family, and\nbystanders [220]. Use a professional tone, courtesy, sincere concern, and efficient\naction [221]. Patients must have the opportunity to express their fears and concerns\n[222]. Religious customs or needs of the patient must be respected [223]. Some people\nhave religious convictions opposing medication, blood, and blood products [223].\nReport this information to the next level of care [224]. In the event of death, handle the\nbody with respect and dignity [225].\nWorkplace issues include cultural diversity on the job [226]. You are expected to work\nalongside co-workers with varying backgrounds, attitudes, beliefs, and values [226].\nAccept their differences [226]. Culture is not restricted to different nationalities [227].\nConsider age, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, work experience, and education\n[227]. Communicate in a way sensitive to everyone\u0027s needs [228]. Cultural humility\nshould be your ultimate goal [228]. Remain curious about others and reflect on their\nviewpoints with an open mind [228].\nTwo types of sexual harassment exist [229]. Quid pro quo is when a harasser requests\nsexual favors for something else, like a promotion [229]. Hostile working environment\ncan involve jokes, touching, requesting a date, or talking about body parts [230]. The\nharasser\u0027s intent does not matter; the perception and impact of the behavior do [231].\nSince EMTs depend on each other for safety, developing non-adversarial\nrelationships is especially important [231]. Report harassment to your supervisor\nimmediately [232].\nSubstance abuse is another workplace issue [233]. It increases the risk of accidents\nand tension [233]. It causes poor treatment decisions [234]. Many EMS systems require\nperiodic random drug tests [235]. They also have for-cause testing when individuals\nare believed to be under the influence [235]. Addicts and alcoholics develop great\nskills at covering their behavior [236]. Seek help or confront an addicted coworker [237]\n. Allowing substance abuse presents a tremendous hazard to the public [237].\nEmployee assistance programs (EAPs) are often available [238].\nInjury and illness prevention is important [239]. EMS providers visit emergency\ndepartments for work-related injuries over 20,000 times each year [239]. Each\nprogram should include interrelated elements [240]. These elements include\nmanagement leadership and worker prevention [240]. Hazard identification and\nassessment are crucial [240]. Hazard prevention and control are necessary [240].\nEducation and training are important [240]. Program evaluation and improvement are\nalso included [241].\n15. Review of Key Concepts\nA disease that can spread from person to person or species to species is known as a\ncommunicable disease [242]. The most effective way of preventing disease spread is\nhand washing [243]. When an EMT has blood splash into their eyes, it is an example of\nan exposure [244]. Protective measures preventing healthcare workers from\ncontacting germs are called standard precautions [246].\nIn the general adaptation syndrome, the second stage of stress response is reaction\nand resistance [247]. A condition characterized by re-experiencing an event and overresponding\nto recalled stimuli is post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) [247].\nNutritious food is the fuel that makes the body run [249]. Physical exertion and stress\nrequire high energy output [249]. The stage of grieving commonly resulting in blame is\nanger and hostility [250]. Placards are used on buildings and transport vehicles [251].\nThe five most common hazards associated with a structural fire are smoke, oxygen\ndeficiency, high temperatures, toxic gases, and building collapse risk [252].",

Introduction to Medical, Legal, and Ethical Issues in Emergency\nCare\nThis report covers medical, legal, and ethical issues relevant to EMTs [1].\nIt will explain the ethical responsibilities and medical legal directives and\nguidelines for EMTs [2].\nKey concepts include confidentiality, consent to treat, refusal of care, and\nadvance directives [3].\nTopics like organ donor systems, evidence preservation, and end-of-life\nissues are also discussed [4].\nA basic principle is to do no further harm [6].\n2. Consent in Emergency Medical Care\nConsent is the permission to render care [9].\nA patient must give consent for treatment [9].\nThe foundation of consent is decision-making capacity [11].\nThis means the patient can understand and process information [11].\nThe patient can also make an informed choice [11].\nPatient autonomy is the patient\u0027s right to make decisions about their health\n[12].\nFactors for determining decision-making capacity include intellectual\ncapacity, legal age, and impairment from alcohol, drugs, injury, or illness [13].\nExpress consent means the patient acknowledges they want care and\ntransport [14].\nFor consent to be valid, it must be informed consent [15].\nYou must explain the nature of treatment, risks, benefits, alternatives,\nand consequences of refusing care [15].\nimplied consent applies to patients who are unconscious or incapable of\nmaking a rational decision [16].\nThis is based on the emergency doctrine [19].\nIt is used when a serious threat to life exists [17].\nTry to get consent from a spouse or relative if possible [20].\nInvoluntary consent applies to patients who are mentally ill, in a behavioral\ncrisis, or developmentally delayed [21].\nConsent should be obtained from a guardian or conservator [22].\nLocal provisions may allow for protective custody statutes [23].\nFor minors, the parent or legal guardian usually gives consent [25].\nSome states allow emancipated minors to give consent [25].\nemancipated minors may be married, in the armed services, or parents\n[26].\nSchool teachers or officials may provide consent for injuries at school or\ncamp [27].\nIn a true emergency with no consent available, consent is implied for\nminors [28].\nForcible restraint is necessary for combative patients who are a danger to\nthemselves or others [29].\nforcible restraint is legally permissible with medical control\nauthorization and law enforcement assistance [30].\nRestraining without legal authority can lead to civil and criminal penalties\n[30].\nDo not remove restraints en route unless they pose a risk [31].\nConsider ALS backup for chemical restraint [32].\nAdults with decision-making capacity have the right to refuse treatment\n[34].\nThey can withdraw from treatment at any time [35].\nRefusal of treatment calls require caution and involvement of medical\ncontrol [36].\nThe decision to refuse should be based on information provided by the\nEMT [37].\nWhen treatment is refused, assess the patient\u0027s ability to make an\ninformed decision [38].\nIf the patient is confused or delusional, you cannot assume the refusal is\ninformed [39].\nProviding treatment is often more defensible than failing to treat [40].\nEnsure your safety with law enforcement if needed [40].\nEncourage the patient to permit treatment and call back if their condition\nworsens or they change their mind [41].\nAdvise the patient to contact their own physician [43].\nAsk the patient to sign a refusal of treatment form with a witness [43].\nThoroughly document all refusals [44].\nConsent\nType\nDescription Applies To\nExpress\nConsent\nPatient directly agrees to care\nand transport\nConscious, rational, capable\npatients\nImplied\nConsent\nAssumed consent based on life\nthreat\nUnconscious or incapacitated\npatients\nInvoluntary\nConsent\nConsent obtained from\nguardian/conservator or legal\nauthority\nMentally ill, behavioral crisis,\nor developmentally delayed\npatients\nMinor\nConsent\nUsually parent/guardian, but can\nbe minor in certain cases\nPatients under legal age\n3. Confidentiality and HIPAA\nCommunication between the EMT and patient is confidential [45].\nConfidential information includes history, assessment findings, and\ntreatments [46].\nInappropriately releasing this information is breach of confidentiality [47].\nRecords can usually be released only with a patient signed release, a legal\nsubpoena, or for billing purposes [48].\nHIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) strengthened\nprivacy laws [49].\nHIPAA protects patient information obtained during medical treatment [51].\nThis is called Protected Health Information (PHI) [52].\nPHI includes medical information and identifiable information [53].\nFailure to follow HIPAA can result in civil or criminal action [54].\nThe general public is often allowed to record identifying patient information\n[55].\nEMTs should avoid associating with their agency on social media while off\nduty unless an official spokesperson [56].\nConduct yourself with the same professionalism online as on duty [58].\nRecognize that free speech has limitations [60].\n4. Advanced Directives and End-of-Life Issues\nadvanced directives are written documents specifying medical treatment\nfor a competent patient who becomes unable to make decisions [66].\nA Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) order gives permission to withhold\nresuscitation [63].\nA DNR does not mean do not treat [64].\nYou are obligated to provide supportive measures even with a DNR [65].\nadvanced directives are often called a living will or healthcare directive [66].\nValid DNR orders must meet specific requirements [67].\nThese requirements include a clear statement of the medical problem,\nsignatures of the patient/guardian and physician/healthcare provider, and\nan expiration date within the preceding 12 months [67].\nYou may encounter Physician\u0027s Orders for Sustaining Treatment (POST) or\nMedical Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (MOLST) forms for terminally\nill patients [70].\nThese forms explicitly describe acceptable interventions and must be\nsigned by an authorized medical provider [70].\nContact medical control if you encounter these documents [71].\nPatients may name surrogates called Durable Powers of Attorney for\nHealthcare or healthcare proxies [72].\nDetermining the cause of death is a medical responsibility of a physician\n[73].\npresumptive signs of death include unresponsiveness, lack of\npulse/heartbeat, absence of chest rise/fall, no reflexes, no pupillary activity,\nno blood pressure, profound cyanosis, and decreased body temperature [74].\ndefinitive signs of death are obvious mortal damage, dependent lividity, rigor\nmortis, algor mortis, and putrefaction [75].\ndependent lividity is blood settling to the lowest point of the body [76].\nrigor mortis is the stiffening of body muscles, occurring 2 to 12 hours after\ndeath [78].\nalgor mortis is the cooling of the body [80].\nputrefaction is the decomposition of body tissues, occurring 40 to 96 hours\nafter death [81].\nThe medical examiner or coroner must be notified in certain cases [82].\nThese cases include dead on arrival, death without previous medical care,\nphysician unable to state cause of death, suicide, violent death, poisoning,\naccident, suspicion of criminal act, and infant/child deaths [82].\nLimit your disturbance of a death scene [84].\nKeep thorough notes if emergency care is initiated at a death scene [84].\nTreat potential organ donors the same as any other patient [85].\nYour priority is to save the patient\u0027s life [85].\nOrgan donor information may be on a donor card or driver\u0027s license [85].\nmedical identification insignia (bracelets, necklaces, etc.) indicate\nconditions like DNRs, allergies, or serious medical conditions [85].\nValid DNR Requirement Description\nClear statement of the patient\u0027s\nmedical problem\nSpecifies the patient\u0027s condition\nSignature of the patient or legal\nguardian\nProvides authorization from the patient or\ntheir representative\nSignature of one or more physicians\nor licensed HCPs\nConfirms the medical order by a qualified\nprofessional\nDated within the preceding 12\nmonths\nEnsures the order is current\n5. Legal Aspects of EMT Practice\nscope of practice outlines the care you are able to provide [88].\nIt is usually defined by state law [88].\nThe medical director further defines the scope of practice through protocols\nor standing orders [89].\nAuthorization for treatment comes from the medical director [90].\nThis can be online (radio/telephone) or offline (standing orders/protocol)\n[90].\nCarrying out procedures outside the scope of practice can be considered\nnegligence [90].\nThe standard of care is the manner in which you must act or behave [91].\nIt is defined as how a person with similar training would act under similar\ncircumstances [92].\nStandards of care are established by local custom, law (statutes, ordinances,\nregulations, case law), professional/institutional standards, EMS agency\nrules, textbooks, and state medical practices acts [93].\nduty to act is an individual\u0027s responsibility to provide patient care [97].\nOnce your ambulance responds or treatment begins, you have a legal duty to\nact [97].\nIf off duty, you are generally not legally obligated to stop and assist [98].\nYou must know local laws and policies regarding duty to act [99].\nnegligence is the failure to provide the same care as a person with similar\ntraining in the same situation [101].\nFour factors must be present for negligence to apply: duty, breach of duty,\ndamages, and causation [102].\nDuty is the obligation to provide care [104].\nBreach of duty means the EMT did not act within the standard of care\n[104].\nDamages means the patient was physically or physiologically harmed\n[105].\nCausation is a cause and effect relationship between the breach of duty\nand the damages [106].\nres ipsa loquitur means the EMT can be liable if an injury occurred, the EMT\nwas in control, and injuries don\u0027t generally occur without negligence [108].\nnegligence per se applies when conduct violates a statute, like an EMT\nperforming an ALS skill outside their scope that causes injury [108].\ntorts are civil wrongs, such as defamation or invasion of privacy [109].\nabandonment is the unilateral termination of care without the patient\u0027s\nconsent or provision for continued care by a competent professional [111].\nOnce care begins, you must continue until an equally competent provider\nassumes responsibility [112].\nabandonment can occur at the scene or in the emergency department [113].\nObtain a signature on your patient record from the person accepting\ntransfer of care [113].\nAssault is unlawfully placing a person in fear of immediate bodily harm,\nincluding threatening restraint [114].\nBattery is unlawfully touching a person, including providing medical care\nwithout consent [116].\nKidnapping is seizing, confining, abducting, or carrying away by force,\nincluding transporting a patient against their will [117].\nFalse imprisonment is unauthorized confinement of a person [118].\nSerious legal problems can arise if a patient rescinds consent and is confined\n[118].\nDefamation is the communication of false information that damages a\nperson\u0027s reputation [119].\nLibel is written defamation [119].\nSlander is spoken defamation [119].\nStatements on your run report should be accurate, relevant, and factual [119].\ngood samaritan laws offer immunity for errors made in good faith when\nreasonably helping another person without expectation of compensation and\nacting within your training, provided you did not act in a grossly negligent\nmanner [119].\nGross negligence is willful or reckless disregard for a duty or standard of\ncare [120].\nImmunity statutes may apply to EMS systems that are not governmental\nagencies [121].\nsovereign immunity limits liabilities for governmental entities [121].\n6. Documentation and Reporting Requirements\nCompile complete and accurate records of all incidents [121].\nRecords are an important safeguard against legal complications [121].\nIf an action was not recorded, the court may perceive it as not performed\n[122].\nIncomplete or untidy reports suggest incomplete and inexpert care [122].\nnemsis is the National EMS Information System [123].\nnemsis allows for the collection, storage, and sharing of standardized EMS\ndata [124].\nSome states have special mandatory reporting requirements for healthcare\nproviders [125].\nMandatory reporting requirements may vary by state [126].\nThese include reporting child abuse, elder abuse, and abuse of at-risk\nadults [127].\nOther mandatory reports include injuries during a felony, drug-related\ninjuries, childbirth, attempted suicides, dog bites, certain communicable\ndiseases, assaults, and domestic violence [128].\nReporting is also mandatory for sexual assault/rape, exposures to\ninfectious diseases, transport of patients in restraints, crime scenes, and\nthe deceased [130].\n7. Ethical Responsibilities and the EMT in Court\nEMTs have ethical responsibilities as healthcare providers [131].\nEthics is a philosophy of right and wrong, moral duties, and ideal\nprofessional behavior [132].\nMorality is a code of conduct affecting character, conduct, and\nconsequence [133].\nbioethics addresses ethical issues in healthcare practice [133].\nEMTs will face ethical dilemmas requiring evaluation and application of\nethical standards [134].\nApplied ethics is how ethical principles are incorporated into professional\nconduct [135].\nAllow rules, laws, and policies to guide your decision-making [135].\nEMTs can be involved in court as a witness or a defendant [136].\nCases can be civil or criminal [136].\nIf subpoenaed, immediately notify your service director and legal counsel\n[137].\nAs a witness, remain neutral and review the run report beforehand [138].\nAs a defendant, an attorney is required, often supplied by your service [139].\nIn a civil suit, defenses may include statutes of limitations, governmental\nimmunity, and contributory negligence [140].\nStatutes of limitations are the time frame for starting a case [140].\nGovernmental immunity may protect municipalities or entities from\nlawsuits or limit monetary judgments [140].\nContributory negligence is when the plaintiff\u0027s conduct contributed to\ntheir injuries [142].\nDiscovery is when both sides obtain information, including depositions (oral\nquestions) and interrogatories (written questions) [143].\nMost cases are settled after discovery and do not go to trial [146].\nIf a case goes to trial, damages can be awarded [147].\nCompensatory damages compensate the plaintiff for injuries [148].\nPunitive damages deter the defendant from repeating behavior and are\nfor reckless or intentional actions [149].\nIf a judgment is against you, your service or insurance carrier usually pays\n[151].\nAn EMT charged with a criminal offense should immediately get an\nexperienced criminal attorney [152].",

Introduction to Communications and Documentation in EMS\nCommunication is sending information from one person to another [4]. This\ncan be verbal or through body language, which is non-verbal [4].\nEffective communication is a key part of pre-hospital care [5].\nIt helps build a good relationship with patients and co-workers [6].\nVerbal skills let you gather information from patients and bystanders [8].\nCommunication helps coordinate with other responders at a scene [8]. It is\nalso vital for transferring patient care to hospital staff [8].\nDocumentation is the written or electronic record of patient care [9].\nIt proves that appropriate care was given [10]. It also shares the patient\u0027s story\nwith those providing future care [10].\nGood reporting and records ensure care continues smoothly [11]. They also\nensure proper transfer of responsibility [11].\nRecords help comply with health department and law enforcement rules [11].\nThey meet administrative needs of your organization [11].\nDocumentation also helps fund EMS research [12].\nCommunication systems like computers, radio, and telephone connect EMTs\nto other services [12]. You must know how to use these systems effectively [13]\n.\n2. Therapeutic Communication and Special Populations\ntherapeutic communication uses verbal and non-verbal methods [15]. It\nencourages patients to share their feelings [15]. It builds a positive relationship\nwith each patient [15].\nThe Shannon Weaver communication model helps understand\ncommunication [16]. It has five parts: sender, thought, message, receiver, and\nfeedback [18]. The sender encodes a thought into a message and sends it to\nthe receiver [18]. The receiver decodes the message and sends feedback [19].\nSeveral factors and strategies affect communication [20]. These include age,\nculture, body language, eye contact, and voice tempo [20].\nethnocentrism is thinking your culture is better than others [27]. People with\nthis view interpret messages through their own perspective [28].\ncultural imposition is forcing your views on others [28]. Healthcare providers\nmight do this, thinking their views are superior [28].\nFactor/Strategy Description Evidence\nAge, Culture,\nExperience\nInfluences how a person communicates\n[21]\nBody Language, Eye\nContact\nGreatly affected by culture; powerful\ncommunication tools\n[22]\nFacial Expressions Can show the mood of the patient\n[29]\nClothing, Sex, Posture Factors to consider during\ncommunication\n[20]\nEducation Influences how a person communicates\n[21]\nVoice Tempo, Volume Offer clues about mood and importance\nof message\n[25]\nEnvironment Can affect communication (e.g., noise)\n[20]\nWhen communicating with older patients, identify yourself and be competent\n[76]. Do not assume they are confused [76]. Assess for medical reasons behind\nconfusion [77]. Approach slowly and allow time for responses [78]. Be patient\nand watch for confusion or sensory issues [78]. Locate personal items like\nhearing aids or glasses [82]. Share concerns about their home or pets with\nhospital staff [83].\nWhen communicating with children, understand their fear [84]. Allow them to\nkeep a favorite toy [84]. Have a family member nearby if possible [84]. Be\nhonest about procedures [85]. Respect their modesty [86]. Use an appropriate\ntone and vocabulary [87]. Position yourself at their level [88].\nWhen communicating with hearing impaired patients, position yourself so\nthey can see your lips [90]. Be careful not to lose hearing aids [90]. Have paper\nand a pen available [91]. Speak slowly and distinctly, never shouting [91]. Listen\ncarefully and give short answers [91]. Learning simple sign language phrases\nlike sick, hurt, and help can be useful [92].\nWhen communicating with visually impaired patients, ask if they can see at\nall [94]. Explain everything you are doing [96]. Stay in physical contact [97].\nTransport mobility aids like a cane [98]. If possible, transport guide dogs with\nthe patient [99]. Arrange care for the dog if it cannot be transported [100].\nWhen communicating with non-English speaking patients, you must still get\na medical history [102]. Use short, simple questions [102]. Point to body parts\n[103]. Use a family member or friend to interpret until a professional is available\n[103]. Consider learning common phrases in other languages [104]. Pocket\ncards or translation apps can help [105]. Remember to ask for a translator at\nthe hospital [106].\n3. Nonverbal and Verbal Communication Techniques\nNonverbal communication, or body language, provides more information\nthan words alone [29].\nFacial expressions, body language, and eye contact are important [29].\nPay attention to your own body language, especially with hostile patients [33].\nStay calm to diffuse the situation [34]. Assess the scene for safety [35]. Avoid\nan aggressive posture [36]. Make good eye contact but do not stare [37].\nSpeak calmly and confidently [38]. Never threaten the patient verbally or\nphysically [38].\nPhysical factors like noise can obscure a message\u0027s meaning [40]. Cultural\nnorms dictate the space between people when communicating [41].\nYour gestures, body movements, and attitude are key to building trust [42].\nVerbal communication involves asking questions [45].\nopen-ended questions require detailed answers [45]. Use them whenever\npossible [45]. An example is, \"What seems to be bothering you?\" [46].\nClosed-ended questions have short answers like yes or no [46]. Use these if\nthe patient cannot give long answers [47]. An example is, \"Are you having\ntrouble breathing?\" [47].\nSeveral tools can help obtain information [49]. facilitation encourages patients\nto talk more [49]. A pause gives them time to think and respond [50]. reflection\nis restating their words to confirm understanding [51]. empathy is being\nsensitive to their feelings [53]. clarification asks them to explain what they\nmeant [54]. confrontation makes a patient in denial focus on urgent issues [55]\n. interpretation restates the complaint to confirm understanding [56].\nExplanation provides factual information [57]. A summary provides an\noverview of the conversation and next steps [58].\nTouch can show care and compassion [58]. Use it consciously and sparingly\n[59]. Approach slowly and touch the shoulder or arm respectfully [59]. Avoid\ntouching intimate areas for communication purposes [60].\nInterview techniques to avoid include giving false assurance or unsolicited\nadvice [60]. Do not ask leading or biased questions [61]. Avoid talking too much\nor interrupting [61]. Do not use \"why\" questions, authoritative language, or\njargon [61].\nFamily, friends, and bystanders can be helpful [62]. Allow the patient to\nanswer if possible [62]. Do not be afraid to ask others to step aside [63]. Decide\nif their presence helps or hinders care [64].\nGolden rules help calm and reassure patients [64]. Make eye contact and\nkeep it [64]. Provide your name and use the patient\u0027s proper name [64]. Tell the\ntruth [64]. Use language they understand [64]. Be careful what you say about\nthe patient [64]. Be aware of your body language [64]. Speak slowly and clearly\n[64]. If the patient is hard of hearing, face them [64]. Allow time for answers [64]\n. Act and speak calmly and confidently [64].\n4. Emotional Intelligence in EMS\nemotional intelligence involves people skills [65]. It is the ability to\nunderstand and manage your own emotions [65]. It also means properly\nresponding to the emotions of others [65].\nIt helps diffuse conflicts and build rapport [66]. It leads to more effective\ncommunication [66]. It helps manage difficult situations [66].\nAttributes of emotional intelligence include self-awareness, recognizing your\nemotions and their effect [67]. Self-regulation is controlling impulsive\nemotions and behaviors [67]. Motivation is motivating yourself and others\npositively [68]. empathy is understanding others\u0027 concerns and needs [69].\nSocial skills are developing positive relationships through effective\ncommunication [70].\nTo improve emotional intelligence, assess how you react to stress [71]. Work\non staying calm with minor irritations [71]. Practice mindfulness [72]. Focus on\nthe present moment without blame [72]. Take responsibility for your actions\n[72]. Consider how your actions affect others [72].\nThe behavioral change stairway model helps manage crisis situations [73].\nSteps include active listening, displaying empathy, building rapport, and\nexerting influence [75].\n5. Mission Critical Communications and Patient Handover\nMission critical communications are those where disruption causes task\nfailure [107].\nA shared mental model is important for teams to work effectively [109]. It is\nthe shared understanding of what is happening [109].\nBuilding this model requires answering four questions [111]. What is the\npatient\u0027s main priority? What is the history of prior care? What is the patient\u0027s\ncurrent state? What are the patient\u0027s immediate needs? [111]. Answering these\nquestions quickly helps avoid errors [111].\nEffective patient care handover is crucial for good patient care [112].\nHandover is the transfer of patient information and responsibility [113].\nCommunication failures during handover are a source of medical liability [114].\nWhen giving a handover report, initiate eye contact [115]. Manage the\nenvironment to reduce distractions [115]. Ensure ABCs (airway, breathing,\ncirculation) if priority care is needed [116]. Provide a structured report [117].\nAcronyms like SBAR (Situation, Background, Assessment, Recap of\nTreatment) or SBA2T (Situation, Background, Assessment, Treatment) can be\nused [117].\nThe verbal report should include the patient\u0027s priority condition, prior care,\ncurrent state, and immediate needs [118].\nWhen receiving a handover report, maintain eye contact [119]. Manage the\nenvironment [119]. Ensure understanding [119]. Summarize the report [119].\nGather supplementary patient documentation [119].\n6. Written Communications and Documentation: The Patient Care\nReport (PCR)\nThe patient care report (pcr), also known as the pre-hospital care report, is a\nlegal document [121]. It records all aspects of patient care from dispatch to the\nhospital [122].\nPCRs can be written or electronic [123].\nThe PCR serves six functions [124].\nFunction of the PCR Description\nExamples of information collected on the PCR include chief complaint and\nmechanism of injury [127]. It also includes the level of consciousness, vital\nsigns, and ongoing assessment [127]. Patient demographics, transport\ninformation, and destination choice are documented [127].\nAdministrative information includes incident times, such as dispatch, arrival on\nscene, and arrival at the facility [129]. It also notes when patient care was\ntransferred and the unit was back in service [129].\nElectronic PCRs (ePCRs) comply with nemsis data requirements [131]. They\ncan transmit information directly to hospital computers [131].\nThe narrative section of the PCR is very important [132]. Two common\nnarrative formats are CHART and SOAP [132].\nThe CHART method stands for Chief complaint, History, Assessment,\nTreatment, and Transport [133]. It starts with dispatcher information and the\nchief complaint [135]. History includes details of the current event and medical\nhistory [137]. Assessment describes all assessments, including vital signs [140].\nTreatment details all interventions performed [141]. Transport explains how the\npatient was moved, positioned, and taken to the hospital [142].\nThe SOAP method stands for Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan\n[143]. Subjective includes information from the patient or others [145]. Objective\ndetails are gathered from your assessment, vital signs, and physical findings\n[146]. Assessment summarizes key findings and provides your impression of\nthe problem [147]. Plan documents the treatment provided [148].\nRegardless of the method, the narrative should include times of events and\nassessment findings [148]. It should also detail emergency care provided and\nchanges in the patient [148]. Observations at the scene and final patient\ndisposition are included [148]. Refusal of care and the name of the person\ntaking over care must be documented [148]. Avoid radio codes and\nabbreviations [148].\nAll PCRs are confidential documents [149]. Once complete, distribute copies\nto appropriate locations [149].\n7. Health Information Exchanges (HIEs) and Reporting Errors\nHealth Information Exchanges (HIEs), abbreviated as HIE, improve data\nsharing [150]. They allow EMS to share data with other healthcare providers\n[151].\nHIEs let EMS providers access relevant patient data [152]. They help avoid\nduplicating data entry [152]. They allow viewing patient outcomes related to\nhospital care [152].\nEMTs can contribute to and access electronic health information through HIEs\n[153].\nMost HIEs follow the SAFER framework [154]. SAFER stands for Search, Alert,\nFile, and Reconcile [154].\nSearch means EMS can search for hospital records [155]. This helps with\ntreatment and transport decisions [155]. Alert means hospitals are notified of\nincoming patients [156]. Information from the EMS ePCR populates hospital\ndashboards [156]. File means data from the EMS ePCR is put into the patient\u0027s\nhealth record [157]. Reconcile provides feedback to EMS agencies on patient\noutcomes [157]. This data is used for billing and quality improvement [158].\nIt is important to report errors accurately [159]. Do not try to cover up\nomissions or inaccuracies [159]. This is falsification and can lead to poor care,\nsuspension, or legal action [159].\nThe proper way to correct a mistake on a handwritten report is to draw a\nsingle horizontal line through the error [160]. Initial it and write the correct\ninformation next to it [161].\nIf an error is found after submitting, follow the same process [162]. Add a note\nwith the correct information [162].\nIf information was omitted, begin a new section with the word \"addendum\"\n[163]. Add the new information and your dated initials [164].\nNever use correction fluid or erase errors [165].\n8. Documenting Refusal of Care and Special Reporting Situations\nDocumenting refusal of care is very important [166]. It is a common source of\nlawsuits [166].\nThorough documentation is crucial [166].\nInclude all assessment findings and emergency care given [167]. Have the\npatient sign a refusal of care form [167]. Have a witness like a family member or\npolice officer also sign [167].\nDocumentation should include evidence the patient made a rational,\ninformed decision [167]. Detail discussions about recommended care and\npotential consequences of refusal [167]. Include discussions with family or\nbystanders who tried to encourage care [167]. Note discussion with medical\ndirection if required by protocol [167].\nAlso document providing the patient with alternatives [168]. Examples include\nseeing their family doctor or having someone drive them to the hospital [168].\nDocument the willingness of EMS to return [168]. Obtain signatures and\ncomplete the PCR [168].\nSpecial reporting situations depend on local requirements [169]. Examples\ninclude gunshot wounds and dog bites [169]. Certain infectious diseases,\nsuspected abuse (physical or sexual), and mass casualty incidents (MCIs) are\nalso special situations [169].\n9. Communication Systems and Equipment\nRadio and telephone communications connect EMS teams with other\nservices [170]. This includes fire and law enforcement [170]. They help the entire\nteam work together and provide safety [171].\nA base station radio contains the transmitter and receiver [172]. It is usually in\na fixed location [172]. A channel is an assigned frequency for communications\n[173]. A dedicated line, or hotline, is for specific point-to-point contact [174].\nA mobile radio is installed in a vehicle like an ambulance [176]. Ambulances\noften have more than one [177].\nPortable radios are handheld [178]. They are essential at MCI scenes or when\naway from the ambulance [178]. They help communicate with dispatch, other\nunits, or medical control [179].\nRepeater-based systems use a special base station radio called a repeater\n[180]. The repeater receives signals on one frequency and transmits them on\nanother [181]. This allows units that cannot reach each other directly to\ncommunicate [181].\nDigital equipment is used in the field [185]. Telemetry converts electronic\nsignals into coded audible signals [186]. These can be sent by radio or phone\nto a hospital receiver [187]. It is used for data from cardiac monitors [187].\nCellular and satellite telephones are also used [189]. EMTs often use cellular\nphones to talk to hospitals [189]. Satellite phones are another option [189].\nA scanner searches across several frequencies [190]. It stops when it receives\na broadcast [190]. Conversations can be easily overheard [191].\nAmbulances usually have an external public address system [192].\nTwo-way radio hardware includes simplex, duplex, and multiplex [193].\nSimplex is push-to-talk, release-to-listen [194]. Duplex allows simultaneous\ntalk and listen [195]. Multiplex uses multiple frequencies for simultaneous\ntransmissions [195].\nMED channels are reserved for EMS use [196]. Trunking systems assign many\nfrequencies and use a computer to find an open one [197].\nMobile data terminals (MDTs) are computers in the ambulance [198]. They\nreceive data from dispatch and provide expanded capabilities [199]. For\nexample, they can show a map to the dispatched address [200].\n10. Regulations and Protocols Governing Radio Communications\nThe Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulates all radio\noperations in the US [202].\nThe FCC has five main EMS-related responsibilities [202].\nThey allocate specific radio frequencies for EMS use [203].\nThey license base stations and assign call signs [204].\nThey establish license standards and specifications for EMS radio\nequipment [205].\nThey set limitations for transmitter power outputs [206].\nThey monitor radio operations [206].\nFCC rules regarding EMS communications are found in Part 90, Subpart B\n[207].\n11. Communication with Dispatch and Medical Control\nThe dispatcher receives the initial 911 call [209]. Their responsibility starts\nwith screening calls and assigning priority [210]. This is done according to\nprotocols [211].\nThey select and alert the correct EMS unit [212]. They direct the unit to the\nlocation [213]. They coordinate EMS with other public safety services [213].\nThey also provide emergency medical instructions to the caller [214].\nThe dispatcher assigns units based on factors like the problem\u0027s severity and\nresponse time [215]. The level of training and need for additional support are\nalso considered [215].\nThe dispatcher should give responding units information [216]. This includes\nthe nature and severity of the illness or injury [216]. The exact location and\nnumber of patients are provided [217]. Response of other agencies and special\nadvisories (like traffic or weather) are given [219]. They also provide the time\nthe units were dispatched [219].\nEMTs should report any problems during the run to dispatch [220]. They\nshould inform dispatch upon arrival at the scene [220]. The arrival report\nshould include obvious details from the scene size-up [220].\nRadio communications must be brief and clear [221]. Use plain English and\navoid codes [221]. Report only important information [222].\nThe main reason for radio communication with medical control or hospitals\nis to facilitate communication [223]. Medical control can be at the hospital or\nanother facility [224].\nConsulting with medical control serves many purposes [225]. It notifies the\nhospital of an incoming patient [225]. It allows requesting advice or receiving\norders [225]. It advises the hospital in special situations [225].\nPlan and organize your radio communication before transmitting [226]. A\npatient report to medical control commonly includes 10 elements [226]. These\ninclude unit ID, service level, patient condition, and estimated time of arrival\n[226]. Patient age, gender, chief complaint, and history are included [226].\nPhysical findings, care given, patient response, and any questions from the\nfacility are also part of the report [226].\nThe role of medical control is either offline (indirect) or online (direct) [227].\nYou may need to call medical control for direct orders [227]. This could be for\nadministering certain treatments or determining transport destination [227].\nPermission might be needed to stop treatment or not transport [227].\nIn many areas, medical control is provided by hospital physicians [229].\nHowever, variations exist, and it may come from a freestanding center [230].\nWhen calling medical control, your report must be precise and contain only\nimportant information [232]. Never use codes unless directed by local protocol\n[233].\nAfter receiving an order from medical control, repeat it back word for word\n[234]. Receive confirmation [234]. Do not follow an order that does not make\nsense [235].\n12. Information Regarding Special Situations and Equipment\nMaintenance\nYou may initiate communication with hospitals about extraordinary\nsituations [236].\nNotifying a small rural hospital early about multiple patients from a crash helps\nthem respond [237]. An entire hospital system must be notified of any disaster\n[237].\nOther special situations to relay include hazardous material incidents or\nrescues in progress [238]. Possible multiple casualty incidents (MCIs) should\nalso be communicated [238].\nWhen identifying special situations to the hospital, several points are\nimportant [239]. The earlier you notify them, the better [239]. Provide an\nestimated number of patients needing transport [240]. Identify any special\nneeds patients might have, like burns or hazmat exposure [240]. This helps the\nhospital prepare [241].\nMaintenance of radio equipment is necessary [242]. Like other EMS\nequipment, it must be serviced at the start of each shift [242]. Check your\nradio equipment [243].\nRadio equipment may fail during a run [244]. You must have and follow a\nbackup plan [244].\nStanding orders are written documents signed by the medical director [245].\nThey outline specific directions and permissions [245]. When followed\nproperly, they have the same authority as orders given over the radio [246].",

Introduction to Medical Terminology\nEffective communication and documentation in healthcare rely on a strong\nknowledge of medical terminology [6].\nUnderstanding medical terms, symbols, and abbreviations is crucial for EMTs\n[6].\nKnowing medical jargon helps in communicating with EMS, healthcare, and\npublic safety teams [8].\nThe purpose of medical terminology is to use foundational and anatomical\nterms for communication [2].\nYou can define unknown words by understanding term formation and\ncomponent definitions [7].\nComponent Description\nWord Root Foundation of the word [12]\nPrefix Occurs before the word root [14]\nSuffix Occurs after the word root [16]\nCombining Vowels Vowels that join word roots or other components [17]\n2. Anatomy of Medical Terms: Word Roots, Prefixes, and Suffixes\nA word root is the main part or stem of a word [25].\nIt conveys the essential meaning and often indicates a body part [27].\nMost terms have at least one word root [28].\nA prefix appears at the beginning of a term [32].\nprefixes usually describe location or intensity [33].\nThey give the word root its specific meaning [34].\nsuffixes are placed at the end of words [36].\nsuffixes usually indicate a procedure, condition, disease, or part of speech [37]\n.\nAccurate spelling is essential in medical terminology [19].\nFor instance, \"-phasia\" means speaking, but \"-phagia\" means eating or\nswallowing [20].\nAdding \"dys-\" (difficult/painful) to \"-phasia\" makes \"dysphasia\" (difficulty\nspeaking) [21].\nAdding \"dys-\" to \"-phagia\" makes \"dysphagia\" (difficulty eating or\nswallowing) [21].\n3. Combining Vowels and Word Building Rules\nA combining vowel connects a word root to a suffix or another word root [39].\nThe combining vowel helps ease pronunciation [40].\nIn most cases, the combining vowel is \"o\" [40].\nIt can also be \"i\" or \"e\" when joining a suffix starting with a consonant [40].\nA combining form is the combining vowel shown with the root word [41].\nRule Application\nPrefix is always at the beginning [42] Example: \"dys-\" in dysuria [91]\nSuffix is always at the end [42] Example: \"-pathy\" in nephropathy\n[88]\nUse a combining vowel when a suffix begins\nwith a consonant [43]\nMakes pronunciation easier [43]\nUse a combining vowel between two word\nroots [43]\nEven if the second root begins\nwith a vowel [43]\n4. Plural Endings and Special Word Parts\nChanging a singular term to plural follows specific rules [45].\nSometimes, you can simply add an \"s\" [45].\nMore complicated rules exist for other endings [45].\nSingular Ending Plural Ending Example\n-a -ae\n[46]\n-is -es\n[47]\n-ex or -ix -ices\n[48]\n-in, -im, -um -a\n[48]\n-us -i Bronchus becomes bronchi [48]\nprefixes can indicate numbers, colors, positions, or directions [49].\nprefixes for numbers include uni, dipli, null, primi, multi, or bi [50].\nword roots for colors include cyano, leuco, uro, cyro, or melano [51].\nprefixes for positions or directions include ab, add, d, circum, preemie, trans,\nepi, or supra [52].\n5. Directional and Movement Terms\ndirectional terms are needed to discuss the specific location of an injury [53].\nThey can also describe how pain radiates [53].\nsuperior means towards the head [56].\ninferior means towards the feet [56].\nlateral is away from the midline [57].\nmedial is towards the midline [57].\nproximal is towards the trunk of the body [59].\ndistal is away from the trunk or nearer to the free end of an extremity [59].\nSuperficial is closer to or on the skin [60].\nDeep is farther inside the body or tissue [60].\nventral refers to the belly side or anterior surface [61].\ndorsal refers to the spinal side or posterior surface [61].\npalmar is the front region or palm of the hand [62].\nPlantar is the sole of the foot [62].\napex is the tip of any structure [62].\nflexion is bending a joint [73].\nextension is straightening a joint [73].\nadduction is moving a body part towards the midline [74].\nabduction is moving a body part away from the midline [74].\nBilateral means appearing on both sides of the midline [76].\nUnilateral means appearing on only one side of the body [78].\n6. Patient Positions\nPosition Description\nProne Patient is lying face down [80]\nSupine Patient is lying face up [81]\nFowler\u0027s Semi-reclining with head elevated [83]\nSemi-Fowler\u0027s Patient sits with back at a 45-degree angle [84]\nHigh Fowler\u0027s Patient is sitting at a 90-degree angle [85]\n7. Breaking Down Medical Terms: Examples\nYou can understand terms by breaking them into parts [87].\nNephropathy has three parts [87].\n\"-pathy\" is the suffix meaning disease [88].\n\"o\" is the combining form [89].\n\"nephra\" is the word root meaning kidney [89].\nNephropathy means disease of the kidney [90].\ndysuria can be broken down [91].\n\"-ia\" is the suffix meaning a condition of [91].\n\"dys-\" is the prefix meaning difficult, painful, or abnormal [92].\n\"ur\" is the word root meaning urine [94].\ndysuria means painful urination [94].\nhyperemesis has a prefix and a word root [95].\n\"hyper-\" is the prefix meaning excessive [96].\n\"emesis\" is the word root meaning vomiting [97].\nhyperemesis means excessive vomiting [97].\nanalgesic has a suffix, prefix, and word root [99].\n\"-ic\" is the suffix meaning pertaining to [99].\n\"an-\" is the prefix meaning without or absent of [99].\nThe word root refers to pain [99].\nanalgesic means pertaining to no pain [99].\n8. Medical Abbreviations, Acronyms, and Symbols\nMedical abbreviations, acronyms, and symbols are used as shorthand for\ncommunication [100].\nThey allow for faster communication [100].\nOnly commonly understood abbreviations should be used [100].\nThis minimizes misinterpretations and errors [100].\nThe Joint Commission and Institute of Safe Medicine Practices are authorities\non abbreviations [101].\nThey provide \"do not use\" lists [101].\nAn acronym shortens several words, usually using the first letter of each [102].\nIt forms a shorter term pronounced as its own word [103].\nBe familiar with accepted uses in your local jurisdiction [103].\nOnly widely understood and accepted symbols should be used [103].\nType Description\nAbbreviations Shorthand for faster communication [100]\nAcronyms Shortened terms using initial letters, pronounced as a word [102]\nSymbols Shorthand for communication [100]\n9. Review of Key Concepts\nThe word root conveys the essential meaning of a medical term [104].\nprefixes indicate colors, numbers, positions, and directions [105].\nThe plural form of \"bronchus\" is \"bronchi\" [106].\nBeing superior to something means being closer to the head [107].\nMovement of an arm towards the midline is called adduction [108].\nA body part closer to the midline is medial [109].\nventral identifies a body part on the belly side or anterior surface [110].\nThe semi-fowler position means the patient is sitting at a 45-degree angle\n[110].\nA laceration on the plantar surface is on the sole of the foot [111].\nWhen using abbreviations, EMTs should use those in their agency, use only\nmedically accepted ones, and use them to shorten documentation [111].",

Introduction to Human Body Systems\nTerm Definition Importance for Medical\nProfessionals\nAnatomy Focuses on the physical\nstructure of the body and\nits systems [5]\nUnderstanding anatomy is\nimportant [4]\nPhysiology Examines the normal\nfunctions, actions, and\nUnderstanding the roles of\nstructures and system\nactivities of the body and\nits systems [6]\ninteractions in maintaining life\nsupport is important [3]\nPathophysiology Studies the functional\nchanges that accompany a\nparticular disease or\nsyndrome [7]\nDiscussing possible\nconsequences of illness and\ninjury on proper body functioning\nis important [4]\nUnderstanding the human body is important for medical professionals [2].\nThis understanding includes body planes and topographic anatomy [2].\nIdentifying basic structures and functions is also key [3].\nDescribing each body system and its role is necessary [3].\nUnderstanding how systems interact to maintain life is vital [3].\nDiscussing the impact of illness or injury on function is crucial [4].\n2. Topographic Anatomy and Body Planes\ntopographic anatomy applies to the body in the anatomic position [9].\nThe anatomic position is when the body stands facing you [10].\nArms are to the side, and palms face forward [10].\nBody planes are imaginary straight lines that divide the body [11].\nThere are three main body planes [11].\nThe coronal (frontal) plane divides the body\u0027s front and back [12].\nThe sagittal (lateral) plane divides the body\u0027s left and right sides [13].\nA mid-sagittal (midline) plane is a special sagittal plane [14].\nIt cuts the body in half, leaving equal left and right halves [15].\nA transaxial plane divides the body\u0027s top and bottom [15].\n3. Cellular to Systemic Organization\nLevel Composition Forms\nCells Foundation of the human body [18] Tissue [18]\nTissue Cells that share a common function [18] Organs [18]\nOrgans Groups of tissues that perform similar or\ninterrelated jobs [18]\nBody System\n[18]\nBody\nSystem\nOrgans with similar functions working together\n[18]\nHuman Body\nThe human body is organized in a hierarchical manner [17].\nCells are the basic building blocks [18].\nCells with similar functions group together to form tissue [18].\nGroups of tissues performing similar jobs form organs [18].\nOrgans with similar functions work together to form a body system [18].\nUnderstanding this organization is key to understanding the body [19].\n4. The Skeletal System: Structure and Function\nDivision Description Components\nAxial Skeleton Forms the longitudinal axis\nof the body [22]\nSkull, facial bones, thoracic cage,\nvertebral column [22]\nAppendicular\nSkeleton\nComprises the upper and\nlower extremities and their\nconnections [23]\nUpper extremity, pelvis, lower\nextremity [49]\nJoints Occur wherever bones\ncome in contact [25]\nLigaments, cartilage, tendons,\njoint capsule, articular cartilage,\nsynovial membrane [26]\nThe skeletal system gives the body its form [20].\nIt also protects vital internal organs [20].\nThe adult skeletal system has 206 bones [21].\nIt has two major divisions: axial and appendicular [21].\nThe axial skeleton includes the skull down to the coccyx [22].\nThe appendicular skeleton includes the extremities [23].\nThe pelvis includes parts of both divisions [24].\nJoints are where bones meet [25].\nligaments connect bone to bone and stabilize joints [26].\ncartilage cushions bone ends [27].\ntendons attach bone to muscle [28].\nsymphysis joints allow slight movement [29].\njoint capsules hold bone ends together [30].\nArticular cartilage allows bones to glide easily [30].\nsynovial membranes produce fluid for joint movement [31].\nTypes of joints include ball and socket and hinge joints [32].\nThe skull has 28 bones: cranium, facial, and ear bones [36].\nThe cranium protects the brain and has four bones [37].\nThese include the occiput, temporal, parietal, and frontal bones [38].\nFacial bones include the maxilla, zygomas, mandible, orbits, and nasal bones\n[38].\nThe spinal column has 33 vertebrae in five sections [39].\nSections are cervical (7), thoracic (12), lumbar (5), sacrum (5 fused), and\ncoccyx (4 fused) [41].\nVertebrae are connected by ligaments and discs [47].\nThe thorax is formed by thoracic vertebrae and ribs [48].\nIt protects the heart, lungs, esophagus, and great vessels [48].\nThe sternum is in the midline of the chest [48].\nThe upper extremities extend from the shoulder girdle to the fingertips [49].\nThe shoulder girdle includes the clavicle, scapula, and humerus [51].\nThe humerus is the arm\u0027s supporting bone [52].\nThe forearm has the radius (thumb side) and ulna (little finger side) [53].\nThe wrist is a modified ball and socket joint [56].\nThe hand has metacarpals and phalanges [56].\nThe pelvic girdle has hip bones, the sacrum, and the coccyx [56].\nEach hip bone has the ilium, ischium, and pubis [56].\nThe pubic symphysis joins the pubic bones [57].\nThe femur is the longest bone in the lower extremity [58].\nThe femoral head connects to the pelvis [59].\nThe knee is a hinge joint connecting the femur to the tibia and fibula [60].\nThe lower leg bones are the tibia and fibula [60].\nThe foot has tarsals, metatarsals, and phalanges [62].\nThe ankle joint is formed by the tibia, fibula, and talus [63].\nThe foot has seven tarsal bones [65].\nThe talus and calcaneus are the largest tarsal bones [65].\nFive metatarsal bones form the foot\u0027s substance [66].\nThe toes are formed by 14 phalanges [66].\nThe skeletal system allows movement and stores calcium [67].\nIt also helps create blood cells [67].\nThe musculoskeletal system provides posture and protects organs [68].\n5. The Muscular System: Types and Actions\nThere are three types of muscles: skeletal, smooth, and cardiac [69].\nSkeletal muscle attaches to bones [70].\nIt forms the major muscle mass and is voluntary [70].\nVoluntary muscle is under the brain\u0027s direct control [70].\nYou can use skeletal muscle to pick things up [71].\nSmooth muscle and cardiac muscle are involuntary [72].\nThey do not require constant thought to function [72].\nSmooth muscle is in blood vessels and intestines [72].\nCardiac muscle is found in the heart [72].\nContraction and relaxation of skeletal muscle allow movement [74].\nSkeletal muscle contraction also produces heat [75].\nShivering is involuntary muscle action to produce heat [75].\nMuscles also protect underlying structures [75].\n6. The Respiratory System: Anatomy and Physiology\nDivision Components Key Structures\nUpper\nRespiratory\nSystem\nNose, mouth, tongue, jaw,\nlarynx [77]\nPharynx, trachea, epiglottis\n[79]\nLower\nRespiratory\nSystem\nThyroid cartilage, cricoid\ncartilage, cricoid thyroid\nmembrane [79]\nTrachea, carina, main stem\nbronchi, lungs, alveoli [79]\nLungs Held in place by trachea,\narteries, veins, ligaments [80]\nLobes (right has 3, left has\n2), bronchi, bronchioles,\nalveoli [80]\nThe respiratory system is responsible for breathing [76].\nIt exchanges oxygen and carbon dioxide in the lungs [76].\nThe system is divided into upper and lower parts [77].\nThe upper respiratory system includes the nose, mouth, tongue, jaw, and\nlarynx [77].\nThe larynx divides the upper and lower airways [78].\nThe pharynx, trachea, and epiglottis are also in the upper airway [79].\nThe lower airway includes the thyroid cartilage (Adam\u0027s apple) [79].\nThe cricoid cartilage and cricoid thyroid membrane are also present [79].\nThe trachea is below the cricoid cartilage [79].\nIt ends at the carina, dividing into bronchi [79].\nBronchi branch into smaller airways within the lungs [79].\nThe lungs are held in place by the trachea and vessels [80].\nEach lung is divided into lobes [80].\nThe right lung has three lobes, and the left has two [80].\nWithin the lobes are bronchi and bronchioles [81].\nThese end at the alveoli, where gas exchange occurs [81].\nalveoli exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide [81].\nPleura are membranes that cover the lungs (visceral) and line the chest wall\n(parietal) [82].\nFluid between the pleura facilitates lung movement [82].\nThe pleural space is a potential space between the pleura [82].\nThe diaphragm is the primary muscle of breathing [83].\nIt contains voluntary and involuntary muscle [83].\nOther muscles aiding breathing include cervical, intercostal, abdominal, and\npectoral muscles [83].\nInhalation is active; the diaphragm and intercostal muscles contract [85].\nThis creates a larger space in the thoracic cavity, and lungs fill [85].\nIt uses negative pressure ventilation [85].\nExhalation is passive; muscles relax [87].\nThe thoracic cavity returns to normal, and air flows out [87].\nThe respiratory system provides oxygen and eliminates carbon dioxide [90].\nVentilation is air movement between lungs and the environment [91].\nRespiration is gas exchange in alveoli and tissues [91].\nOxygen and carbon dioxide move by diffusion [94].\nDiffusion is passive movement from higher to lower concentration [95].\nThe brain stem controls breathing by monitoring carbon dioxide levels [95].\nHigh carbon dioxide causes pH to decrease, stimulating breathing [95].\nThe medulla oblongata initiates ventilation via the phrenic nerve [96].\nThe primary reason for breathing is to lower carbon dioxide [97].\nPatients with chronic lung disease may use a hypoxic drive [99].\nThis is a backup system stimulated by low oxygen levels [100].\nThe pons helps adjust breathing depth during stress [105].\ntidal volume is air moved in a single breath (about 500 mL in adults) [107].\ninspiratory reserve volume is the deepest breath after normal [107].\nexpiratory reserve volume is maximum air forcefully exhaled [107].\nresidual volume is gas remaining after exhalation [108].\ndead space has no alveoli and little gas exchange [108].\nminute volume assesses ventilation adequacy [110].\nminute volume = respiratory rate Ã— tidal volume [111].\nNormal breathing has a regular rate and depth [112].\nIt has a regular rhythm of inhalation and exhalation [112].\nClear breath sounds should be heard on both sides of the chest [112].\nThe chest should rise and fall regularly on both sides [113].\nMovement of the abdomen is also a sign [113].\nInadequate breathing signs include labored breathing [114].\nRates slower than 12 or faster than 20 are inadequate [114].\nMuscle retractions, pale or cyanotic skin, cool damp skin, or tripod position\nare signs [114].\n7. The Circulatory System: Structure and Function\nComponent Description Function\nHeart Involuntary muscle made of\nmyocardium [119]\nPumps blood throughout the body\n[123]\nArteries High pressure vessels [129] Carry oxygenated blood from the\nheart to tissues (except pulmonary\nartery) [129]\nArterioles Smaller branches of arteries\n[135]\nConnect arteries to capillaries [135]\nCapillaries Tiny blood vessels [138] Connect arteries to venules; gas\nand nutrient exchange occurs here\n[138]\nVenules Small veins [138] Connect capillaries to veins [138]\nVeins Oxygen depleted blood going\nback to heart [142]\nCarry deoxygenated blood back to\nthe heart (except pulmonary veins)\n[142]\nBlood Composed of plasma, red\nblood cells, white blood cells,\nplatelets [150]\nTransports oxygen, CO2, waste,\nnutrients; fights infection;\ncoagulates [166]\nThe circulatory system, or cardiovascular system, is a network of tubes [115].\nIt includes arteries, arterioles, capillaries, venules, and veins [115].\nThere are two circuits: systemic and pulmonary [116].\nsystemic circulation carries oxygen-rich blood from the left ventricle to the\nbody and back to the right atrium [116].\nPulmonary circulation carries oxygen-poor blood from the right ventricle to\nthe lungs and back to the left atrium [117].\nThe heart is an involuntary muscle made of myocardium [119].\nIt functions as two paired pumps [121].\nThe left side is a high-pressure pump; the right side is low-pressure [121].\nThe top chambers are atria; the bottom are ventricles [122].\nThe heart receives blood from the aorta via coronary arteries [123].\nThe right side gets deoxygenated blood from body veins [123].\nOxygenated blood returns from the lungs to the left side via pulmonary veins\n[124].\nValves guide blood flow through the heart [124].\nA normal heart rate is 60 to 100 beats per minute [126].\nStroke volume (SV) is the blood moved by one beat [126].\nCardiac output (CO) is the blood moved in one minute [126].\nCO = Heart Rate Ã— SV [126].\nThe heart has an electrical conduction system [127].\nImpulses start at the sinoatrial node and travel through the heart [127].\nThis produces a coordinated pumping action [128].\nArteries are high-pressure vessels carrying blood away from the heart [129].\nThey carry oxygenated blood, except for the pulmonary artery [130].\nThe aorta is the main artery leaving the left heart [131].\nIts branches supply vital organs [132].\nThe pulmonary artery originates at the right ventricle and carries\ndeoxygenated blood to the lungs [134].\nArteries branch into arterioles, which connect to capillaries [135].\nThe pulse is created by blood pumped into major arteries [137].\nIt can be felt at the neck, wrist, and groin [137].\nCapillaries are tiny vessels connecting arteries to venules [138].\nOxygen and nutrients pass through thin capillary walls to tissues [139].\nCapillaries allow blood flow one cell at a time [140].\nVeins carry oxygen-depleted blood back to the heart [142].\nThey have thinner walls and are larger than arteries [142].\nMajor veins include the superior and inferior vena cava [143].\nThe spleen is a solid organ filtering worn-out blood cells and foreign\nsubstances [146].\nThe spleen is highly vascular and susceptible to injury [148].\nBlood is composed of plasma, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets\n[150].\nPlasma is the liquid portion with water, proteins, and nutrients [150].\nRed blood cells (erythrocytes) contain hemoglobin and carry oxygen [150].\nWhite blood cells (leukocytes) fight infection [151].\nPlatelets help form blood clots [152].\nBlood pressure is the force against artery walls [153].\nSystole is when the left ventricle contracts and pumps blood [154].\nDiastole is when the ventricle relaxes and fills with blood [155].\nBlood pressure is measured with a cuff [156].\nIt is expressed in millimeters of mercury [157].\nPerfusion is adequate blood circulation in organs and tissues [158].\nHypoperfusion, or shock, is inadequate blood supply [159].\nThe body can adjust to small blood loss by constricting vessels and\nincreasing heart rate [161].\nLarge blood loss can lead to shock [163].\nMean arterial pressure can help detect shock [164].\nMean arterial pressure = Cardiac Output Ã— SVR [165].\nBlood functions include fighting infection, transporting oxygen/CO2,\ncontrolling pH, transporting waste/nutrients, and coagulation [166].\n8. Nervous System Control of the Cardiovascular System\nThe nervous system controls the cardiovascular system [168].\nThis involves the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems [169].\nThe sympathetic nervous system controls the \"fight or flight\" response [169].\nIt signals adrenal glands to secrete epi and norepi [169].\nThese stimulate the heart and blood vessels [169].\nAlpha adrenergic receptors are in blood vessels and cause contraction when\nstimulated [170].\nBeta adrenergic receptors are in the heart and lungs [170].\nBeta-1 stimulation increases heart rate and contraction force [171].\nBeta-2 stimulation dilates lung bronchi [171].\nThe parasympathetic nervous system causes heart rate to slow and beat\nmore weakly [171].\nIt is nearly the opposite of the sympathetic system [172].\nThe sympathetic and parasympathetic systems usually balance each other\n[172].\nBaroreceptors detect pressure in blood vessels [173].\nThey are found in the aorta and carotid bodies [173].\nBaroreceptor stimulation adjusts blood pressure via the nervous systems [173].\n9. The Nervous System: Central and Peripheral Divisions\nDivision Components Function\nCentral Nervous\nSystem (CNS)\nBrain, Spinal Cord [176] Most complex system; controls\nvoluntary and involuntary\nactions; transmits messages\n[174]\nPeripheral Nervous\nSystem (PNS)\nNerves outside brain and\nspinal cord [176]\nConnects CNS to rest of the\nbody; divided into somatic and\nautonomic [177]\nSomatic Nervous\nSystem (PNS\nsubdivision)\nNerves transmitting\nsignals to voluntary\nmuscles [198]\nRegulates voluntary control\n(walking, talking, writing) [177]\nAutonomic Nervous\nSystem (PNS\nsubdivision)\nInvoluntary nerves\n(sympathetic,\nparasympathetic) [199]\nControls automatic functions\n(smooth muscle, cardiac\nmuscle, fight or flight, rest and\ndigest) [178]\nThe nervous system is perhaps the most complex system [174].\nIt is divided into two main portions [175].\nThe central nervous system (CNS) includes the brain and spinal cord [176].\nThe peripheral nervous system (PNS) includes all nerves outside the brain\nand spinal cord [176].\nThe PNS is divided into the somatic and autonomic nervous systems [177].\nThe somatic nervous system regulates voluntary control [177].\nThe autonomic nervous system controls automatic functions [178].\nThe brain has three parts: cerebrum, cerebellum, and brain stem [180].\nThe cerebrum is the largest part [180].\nIt is responsible for higher brain function [180].\nIt has two hemispheres, each with four lobes [181].\nThese lobes are frontal, parietal, occipital, and temporal [182].\nThe frontal lobe handles personality and judgment [183].\nThe parietal lobe deals with recognition [184].\nThe occipital lobe deals with vision [184].\nThe temporal lobe handles taste, hearing, and understanding words [184].\nThe cerebellum controls balance, coordination, and posture [185].\nThe brain stem controls life-sustaining functions [187].\nThese include cardiac and respiratory functions and consciousness regulation\n[187].\nThe brain stem is comprised of the midbrain, pons, and medulla oblongata\n[188].\nThe reticular activating system regulates consciousness [188].\nCerebral spinal fluid (CSF) filters impurities and cushions the brain/spinal\ncord [190].\nOxygenated blood is supplied to the head by carotid arteries [192].\nDeoxygenated blood drains via jugular veins [192].\nThe spinal cord is an extension of the brain stem [194].\nIt leaves the skull through the foramen magnum [195].\nIt is encased in the vertebral column [195].\nIts main function is to transmit messages between the brain and the body [196]\n.\nThe peripheral nervous system has two parts: voluntary and involuntary [197]\n.\nThe somatic nervous system transmits signals to voluntary muscles [198].\nIt allows activities like walking and writing [198].\nThe autonomic nervous system is involuntary [199].\nIt includes the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions [199].\nThe PNS has sensory and motor nerves [200].\nSensory nerves carry information from the body to the CNS [200].\nMotor nerves carry information from the brain to muscles [200].\n10. The Integumentary System: Layers and Functions\nThe integumentary system is the skin [201].\nIt has two main layers: the epidermis and the dermis [201].\nThe epidermis is the superficial, watertight layer [201].\nIt is like a protective covering [201].\nThe epidermis is composed of layers, including the stratum corneum [202].\nSkin cells in the epidermis are constantly replaced [202].\nThe dermis is the deeper layer [203].\nIt contains special structures of the skin [203].\nThese include sweat glands, sebaceous glands, and hair follicles [203].\nBlood vessels and mucous membranes are also in the dermis [203].\nBelow the skin is the subcutaneous tissue [204].\nThis is a layer of fat [204].\nSubcutaneous tissue serves as an insulator and energy reservoir [204].\nThe skin is the largest single organ [205].\nIt has three major functions [206].\nIt protects the body from the environment [206].\nIt regulates body temperature [206].\nIt transmits information from the environment to the brain [206].\n11. The Digestive System: Organs and Processes\nOrgan Quadrant Location(s) Primary Function\nLiver Upper right, extends into\nupper left [210]\nFilters harmful substances; forms\nclotting factors; stores\nsugar/starch; produces bile [227]\nGallbladder Upper right [210] Stores bile from the liver [228]\nStomach Upper left [211] Receives and stores food; produces\nmovement into the bowel [222]\nSpleen Upper left [211] Filters blood (part of\nlymphatic/circulatory) [147]\nLarge\nIntestines\n(Colon)\nPortions in upper right,\nupper left, right lower,\nlower left [210]\nAbsorbs final 5-10% of digested\nfood/water; forms solid stool [229]\nSmall\nIntestines\nMore than one quadrant\n[214]\nProduce enzymes and mucus to aid\ndigestion [229]\nPancreas Behind the abdominal\ncavity (Retroperitoneal)\n[215]\nSecretes pancreatic juice\n(exocrine); produces insulin and\nglucagon (endocrine) [224]\nKidneys Behind the abdominal\ncavity (Retroperitoneal)\n[215]\nFilter blood waste; control\nwater/salt balance [248]\nUrinary\nBladder\nBehind pubic symphysis in\npelvic cavity [214]\nStores urine [254]\nAppendix Right lower abdomen [230] Opens into the first part of the\nintestines; can become inflamed\n(appendicitis) [230]\nRectum Not specified by quadrant,\nbut large hollow organ\nholding feces [232]\nHolds feces until expelled [232]\nThe digestive system is also called the gastrointestinal system [208].\nIts components include the abdomen, organs, and vascular structures [208].\nThe abdomen contains major organs of digestion and excretion [208].\nThe abdomen is divided into four quadrants [208].\nUpper right: liver, gallbladder, portion of colon [210].\nUpper left: stomach, spleen, portion of colon [211].\nRight lower: portion of large intestines [212].\nLower left: descending and sigmoid colon [213].\nSome organs are in more than one quadrant [214].\nThe kidneys and pancreas are retroperitoneal, behind the abdominal cavity\n[215].\nDigestion begins in the mouth [218].\nThe mouth includes cheeks, lips, gums, teeth, tongue, and palates [218].\nSalivary glands produce saliva [218].\nThe oral pharynx is a tube from the mouth back to the esophagus/trachea\n[219].\nThe esophagus is a tube from the pharynx to the stomach [220].\nMuscles propel food down the esophagus [221].\nThe stomach is a hollow organ in the left upper quadrant [222].\nIt receives, stores, and moves food into the bowel [222].\nThe pancreas is retroperitoneal, below and behind the liver/stomach [223].\nIts exocrine portion secretes pancreatic juice [224].\nIts endocrine portion produces insulin and glucagon [224].\nInsulin is produced in the pancreas [292].\nThe liver is a large, solid organ in the right upper quadrant [225].\nIt filters substances, forms clotting factors, and stores sugar [227].\nBile ducts connect the liver to the intestine and gallbladder [228].\nThe small intestines produce enzymes and mucus for digestion [229].\nThe large intestine includes the cecum, colon, and rectum [229].\nIts main function is absorbing water and forming stool [229].\nThe appendix is a tube in the right lower abdomen [230].\nIt can become inflamed, causing appendicitis [231].\nThe rectum holds feces until expelled through the anus [232].\nSphincters control the escape of contents from the digestive tract [233].\nDigestion is completed by chemical processes using enzymes [235].\nEnzymes break food into sugars, fatty acids, and amino acids [237].\nDigested products are absorbed into the bloodstream and circulated [238].\n12. The Lymphatic System: Components and Role\nThe lymphatic system is important but not talked about much [240].\nIts elements include the spleen, lymph nodes, lymph vessels, and thymus\ngland [241].\nIt supports the circulatory and immune systems [241].\nLymph is a thin fluid that carries oxygen, nutrients, and hormones to cells [241]\n.\nIt also carries waste products away from cells [241].\nLymph vessels form a network throughout the body [241].\nThis network serves as an auxiliary to the circulatory system [241].\nLymph nodes are tiny structures that filter lymph [242].\nThey help rid the body of toxins and harmful materials [242].\n13. The Endocrine System: Hormones and Regulation\nThe endocrine system is a complex message and control system [244].\nIt integrates many body functions [244].\nEndocrine glands release hormones directly into the bloodstream [245].\nEach gland produces one or more hormones [245].\nEach hormone has a specific effect on an organ, tissue, or process [245].\nThe brain controls the release of hormones [246].\nThe system uses feedback loops to maintain body balance [246].\nExcessive or deficient hormone levels can cause diseases like diabetes [247].\n14. The Urinary System: Function and Organs\nThe urinary system controls the discharge of waste filtered from blood [248].\nIts main functions are controlling fluid balance and eliminating waste [249].\nIt also helps control the body\u0027s pH [249].\nThe kidneys are two solid organs in the retroperitoneal space [250].\nThey rid blood of toxic waste and control water/salt balance [252].\nThe ureters pass from each kidney to the urinary bladder [253].\nThe urinary bladder is located behind the pubic symphysis [254].\nThe urethra controls urine flow from the bladder out of the body [255].\n15. The Genital System: Reproductive Processes\nThe genital system controls the reproductive processes [256].\nThe male reproductive system includes testes, epididymis, vas deferens,\nprostate gland, seminal vesicles, and penis [257].\nIt lies mostly outside the pelvic cavity [257].\nThe female reproductive system includes ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus,\ncervix, and vagina [258].\nIt is contained entirely within the pelvic cavity [259].\n16. The Life Support Chain and Metabolism\nCells are the body\u0027s foundation and require oxygen, nutrients, and waste\nremoval [260].\nThe respiratory and circulatory systems deliver these supplies [260].\nInterference with these systems can damage and kill cells [260].\nCells use oxygen and nutrients to create chemical energy through\nmetabolism [261].\nAerobic metabolism uses oxygen to create energy (ATP) [262].\nWhen oxygen is limited, cells switch to anaerobic metabolism [262].\nAnaerobic metabolism produces lactic acid as a waste product [263].\nAccumulation of lactic acid and waste makes the area toxic [263].\nThis can eventually lead to cell death [263].\nMovement of oxygen, waste, and nutrients occurs by diffusion [264].\npH is critical to diffusion [264].\nThe body uses significant energy to maintain normal pH [264].\n17. Pathophysiology: Respiratory Compromise and Shock\nCondition Definition Causes Effects\nRespiratory\nCompromise\nInability of\nthe body to\nmove gas\neffectively\n[265]\nBlocked airway,\ndamaged breathing\nmuscles, obstructive\nairway (asthma,\noverdose, trauma,\nHypoxia (decreased\noxygen),\nhypercarbia\n(elevated carbon\ndioxide), increased\nallergic reaction), change\nin atmosphere, impaired\ngas movement,\nventilation/perfusion\nmismatch [267]\nrespiratory rate\n(attempt to\ncompensate), blood\nbecomes acidotic,\ndecreased blood\noxygen, shift to\nanaerobic\nmetabolism, cell\ndamage/death [266]\nShock\n(Hypoperfusion)\nInadequate\nblood flow\nand oxygen\nto organs\nand tissues\n[159]\nLarge blood loss\n(systemic adjustment\nfails), impaired oxygen\ndelivery [163]\nCellular hypoxia,\nanaerobic\nmetabolism, lactic\nacid production,\norgan dysfunction,\ndecreased blood\npressure, increased\nheart rate, forceful\nheartbeats, blood\nvessel contraction,\ninterstitial fluid\nmoves into\ncapillaries [275]\nPathophysiology studies functional changes in disease [265].\nRespiratory compromise is the inability to effectively move gas [265].\nIt can lead to hypoxia (low oxygen) or hypercarbia (high carbon dioxide) [266]\n.\nCauses include blocked or obstructed airways [267].\nDamaged breathing muscles can also cause it [267].\nTrauma, allergic reactions, and high altitudes are causes [267].\nImpaired gas movement across membranes is a cause [267].\nA ventilation/perfusion mismatch occurs when gas movement or blood flow\nis abnormal [268].\nPulmonary emboli or fluid in alveoli cause mismatches [269].\nRespiratory compromise causes oxygen levels to fall and carbon dioxide to\nrise [270].\nThe brain increases the respiratory rate to compensate [270].\nIf ineffective, blood becomes more acidotic [271].\nDecreased oxygen forces cells into anaerobic metabolism [273].\nThis leads to shock, inadequate blood flow and oxygen [274].\nImpaired oxygen delivery causes cellular hypoxia [275].\nHypoxia leads to anaerobic metabolism and lactic acid production [275].\nThis results in organ dysfunction [275].\nThe effects of shock are similar to respiratory compromise [278].\nOxygen supplied to tissues fails [278].\nCells switch to anaerobic metabolism and produce lactic acid [278].\nBaroreceptors detect decreased blood pressure [279].\nThey initiate the release of epi and norepi [279].\nThis increases heart rate and contraction force [280].\nBlood vessels contract, and fluid moves into capillaries [280].\nAnaerobic metabolism requires more energy than aerobic [282].\nIt can result in metabolic acidosis [281].\nThere is decreased ability of blood to carry oxygen [283].\nBrain cells cannot use alternative fuels [284].\nDecreased glucose can damage and kill brain cells [284].\nCellular injury can be repairable if perfusion is restored [285].\nIrreversible injury means no treatment will help [285].\n18. Review of Key Concepts\nWhich is found in the retroperitoneal space? The kidneys [287].\nThe cartilaginous tip of the sternum is called the xiphoid process [290].\nA person with bilateral femur fractures has both femurs fractured [291].\nThe most prominent landmark on the anterior neck surface is the Adam\u0027s\napple, also called the thyroid cartilage [291].\nInsulin is produced in the pancreas [292].\ntendons connect muscle to bone [293].\nligaments connect bone to bone [293].\nThe normal resting heart rate in an adult is 60 to 100 beats per minute [294].\nBradycardia is below 60; tachycardia is above 100 [295].\nThe left atrium receives oxygenated blood from the lungs [296].\nThe largest part of the brain is the cerebrum [297].\nWhite blood cells, not red blood cells, help fight infection [299].",

Introduction to Lifespan Development in Emergency Care\nWelcome to chapter 7 on lifespan development [1].\nUnderstanding physiological and psychosocial differences is fundamental [2].\nThis chapter covers each phase of human development [2].\nEMTs must be aware of physical changes across stages [5].\nThese changes alter the approach to patient care [5].\nDiscuss adaptations and strategies for patient assessment [3].\nThese strategies can improve patient management [3].\n2. Neonates and Infants (Birth to 1 Year)\nneonates are from birth to one month [6].\ninfants are from one month to a year [6].\nThey develop at a startling rate [6].\nneonates weigh six to eight pounds at birth [7].\nThe head is 25% of their body weight [8].\ninfants grow about one ounce per day after week two [9].\nThey double their weight by four to six months [9].\nWeight triples by the end of the first year [9].\nAt birth, neonates transition to independent circulation [10].\nPrior to birth, lungs have never been inflated [11].\nThe first breath is facilitated by chest passage [11].\nThis increases inner thoracic pressure [11].\ninfants younger than six months are prone to nasal congestion [12].\ninfants have proportionately larger tongues [13].\nThey have proportionately shorter, narrow airways [13].\nAirway obstructions are more common in infants [13].\nThe rib cage is less rigid [13].\nRibs sit horizontally for bag valve mask ventilation [13].\ninfant lungs are very fragile [14].\nForceful ventilations can result in trauma from pressure [14].\nThis is called barotrauma [14].\nRespiratory muscles are immature [15].\nThere are fewer alveoli in the lungs [15].\nRespiratory problems can quickly become life-threatening [15].\nThe nervous system evolves after birth [16].\nneonates are born with certain reflexes [16].\nmoro reflex is a startle reflex [16].\nThey open arms wide and spread fingers [16].\nThey seem to grab at things [16].\npalmer grasp occurs when an object is placed in palms [17].\nrooting reflex: turns head towards touch on cheek [18].\nsucking reflex occurs when lips are stroked [19].\nfontanelles are spaces between skull bones [19].\nThe posterior fontanelle fuses at about three months [20].\nThe anterior fontanelle fuses at nine to 18 months [20].\nA depressed fontanelle may indicate dehydration [21].\nA bulging fontanelle indicates increased intracranial pressure [21].\nBy two months, infants track objects with eyes [24].\nThey can recognize familiar faces [24].\nAt six months, they can sit upright [25].\nThey begin making cooing and babbling sounds [25].\nBy 12 months, infants can walk with minimal assistance [26].\nThey know their name [26].\nThe immune system maintains some mother\u0027s immunities [27].\ninfants receive antibodies via breast milk [28].\nBreast milk fosters further immune system boosters [28].\nPsychosocial changes begin at birth [29].\nChanges evolve as the infant interacts with the environment [29].\nCrying is the main method of communicating distress [30].\nBonding is based on a secure attachment [30].\nanxious avoidant attachment is seen in repeatedly rejected infants [30].\nThese children show little emotional response to caregivers [31].\nThey treat caregivers as strangers [31].\nseparation anxiety is common in older infants [32].\nTrust and mistrust is a stage from birth to 18 months [33].\nThis involves infant\u0027s needs being met by caregivers [33].\nCharacteristic Description Source\nWeight Birth: 6-8 lbs; Doubles by 4-6 mos; Triples by 1 yr\n[7]\nHead Size 25% of body weight at birth\n[8]\nCardiovascular Transition from fetal to independent circulation at\nbirth\n[10]\nPulmonary Fragile lungs, less rigid rib cage, immature\nmuscles, fewer alveoli\n[14]\nNervous\nSystem\nBorn with Moro, Palmer grasp, Rooting, Sucking\nreflexes; Fontanelles fuse over time\n[16]\nImmune System Maintains mother\u0027s immunities; Receives\nantibodies via breast milk\n[27]\nCommunication Crying is main method\n[30]\nAttachment Secure attachment is key; Anxious avoidant\nattachment from rejection\n[30]\nTrust Developed from needs being met by caregivers\n(birth to 18 mos)\n[33]\n3. Toddlers and Preschoolers (1 to 6 Years)\nToddlers are about one to three years old [35].\nPreschoolers are three to six years old [35].\nCardiovascular system is not dramatically different from adults [35].\nPulse rate is 80 to 140 beats per minute [36].\nRespiratory rate is 20 to 25 breaths per minute [36].\nSystolic blood pressure is 80 to 100 mmHg [36].\nLung musculature is not well-developed [37].\nThey cannot sustain deep or rapid respirations long [37].\nWeight gain should level off [38].\nLoss of passive immunity is impactful [38].\nNeuromuscular growth makes considerable progress [39].\nToilet training is usually completed around 28 months [39].\nThe psychosocial challenge is autonomy versus shame and doubt [40].\nBasic language is mastered around 36 months [41].\nInteraction and playing games with others begins [41].\nCause and effect starts to be understood by 18 to 24 months [41].\nChildren recognize gender differences by observing role models [42].\n4. School-Age Children (6 to 12 Years)\nSchool-aged children are from 6 to 12 years [43].\nPhysical traits and functions mature rapidly [44].\nThey grow four pounds each year [45].\nThey grow two to five inches each year [45].\nPermanent teeth come in [45].\nBrain activity increases in both hemispheres [45].\nChildren learn various types of reasoning [46].\nThree types of reasoning exist [46].\npre-conventional reasoning: acting to avoid punishment and get wants [47].\nconventional reasoning: looking for approval from peers and society [48].\nPost-conventional reasoning: making decisions guided by consequences\n[48].\nChildren begin developing self-concept at this age [48].\nThey also develop self-esteem [48].\nType of\nReasoning\nDescription Source\nPre-conventional Actions based on avoiding punishment and\ngetting desires\n[47]\nConventional Seeking approval from peers and society\n[48]\nPostconventional\nDecisions guided by consequences\n[48]\n5. Adolescents (12 to 18 Years)\nAdolescents are from 12 to 18 years [50].\nVital signs level off within adult ranges [51].\nPulse rate is 60 to 100 beats per minute [51].\nRespiratory rate is 12 to 20 breaths per minute [52].\nSystolic blood pressure is 90 to 110 mmHg [52].\nAdolescents experience a two to three year growth spurt [53].\nMuscle and bone growth increases [53].\nGirls generally finish their growth spurt around 16 [54].\nBoys generally finish their growth spurt around 18 [54].\nThe endocrine and reproductive system matures [55].\nSecondary sexual development takes place [55].\nPubic and axillary hair appear [55].\nVoices start to change [55].\nMenstruation begins [55].\nConflict with parents often occurs as adolescents gain control [56].\nPrivacy becomes an issue [56].\nSelf-consciousness increases [56].\nThey may struggle to create their own identity [57].\nMultiple options for gender exist [57].\nMany are fixated on their public image [58].\nThey often want to be treated like adults [58].\nYet, they want to be cared for like younger children [58].\nAnti-social behavior and peer pressure peak at 14 to 16 [59].\nSmoking, illicit drug use, and unprotected sex may arise [59].\nEating disorders can arise from attempts to gain self-control [59].\nA code of personal ethics develops [60].\nEthics are based on parents\u0027 values, peers, and experience [60].\nAdolescents have a high risk for suicide [61].\nThey also have a high risk for depression [61].\n6. Early Adults (19 to 40 Years)\nEarly adults are from 19 to 40 years [62].\nVital signs do not vary from those in adulthood [62].\nPulse rate averages around 70 beats per minute [62].\nThe range is 60 to 100 beats per minute [62].\nRespiratory rate stays in the range of 12 to 20 [63].\nSystolic blood pressure is between 90 to 120 mmHg [63].\nFrom 19 to shortly after 23, the body functions optimally [64].\nLifelong habits are solidified [65].\nThe body is working at peak efficiency [65].\nIn latter years of early adulthood, aging effects become evident [65].\nLife centers on work, family, and stress [65].\nAdults strive to create a place for themselves [65].\nMany do everything to settle down [65].\nDespite stress and change, this is a stable period [65].\n7. Middle Adults (41 to 60 Years)\nMiddle adults are between 41 to 60 years [66].\nVital signs remain about the same [66].\nMiddle adults are vulnerable to vision loss [67].\nThey are also vulnerable to hearing loss [67].\nCardiovascular health becomes an issue [67].\nThe incidence of cancer increases [67].\nmenopause takes place in the late 40s and early 50s [67].\nDiabetes is common [68].\nHypertension is common [68].\nWeight problems are common [68].\nExercise and a healthy diet can diminish aging effects [69].\nThere is a focus on achieving life\u0027s goals [69].\nMiddle adults readjust lifestyle as children leave home [70].\nFinances can become a worrisome issue [70].\nGenerally, people have physical, emotional, spiritual reserves [70].\nThese reserves help handle life\u0027s issues [70].\nThey may care for children leaving for college [71].\nThey may also care for their aging parents [71].\nCommon Health Issues Source\nVision Loss\n[67]\nHearing Loss\n[67]\nCardiovascular Problems\n[67]\nCancer (increased incidence)\n[67]\nDiabetes\n[68]\nHypertension\n[68]\nWeight Problems\n[68]\n8. Older Adults (61 Years and Up)\nOlder adults include ages 61 years and up [72].\nLife expectancy is constantly changing [73].\nCurrently, it is about 78 years old [73].\nLife expectancy is determined by birth year and country [73].\nThey often overcome numerous medical conditions [74].\nThey may need multiple medications [74].\nCardiac function declines with age [75].\nThis is largely due to atherosclerosis [75].\nHeart rate and cardiac output decrease [75].\nCardiac output may not meet body demands [76].\nThe vascular system becomes stiff [76].\nThe heart works harder to overcome vascular resistance [77].\nAbility to provide replacement blood cells declines [77].\nBlood volume also declines [77].\nThe size of airways may decrease or increase [78].\nSurface area of alveoli decreases [78].\nElasticity and strength of intercostal muscles and diaphragm decrease [78].\nBreathing becomes more labor intensive [78].\nBy age 75, vital capacity may be 50% of a young adult [79].\nThe chest becomes more rigid and fragile [80].\nCough and gag reflexes diminish [80].\nAbility to clear secretions diminishes [80].\nOlder adults are at greater risk of aspiration [80].\nThey are also at greater risk of airway obstruction [80].\nSmooth muscles of the lower airway weaken [81].\nThis causes airway collapse on inhalation [81].\nThis produces inspiratory wheezing [82].\nLower flow rates and air trapping in alveoli occur [82].\nOlder adults are more susceptible to lung infections [83].\nInsulin production drops off [84].\nMetabolism decreases [84].\nReproductive system changes occur [85].\nHormone production for both sexes decreases gradually [86].\nSexual desire may diminish but does not cease [86].\nChanges occur in gastric and intestinal function [87].\nThis may inhibit natural intake and utilization [87].\nTooth loss may make chewing difficult [87].\nTaste and sensations decrease [87].\nSaliva secretion decreases [87].\nThis reduces ability to produce complex carbohydrates [87].\nIntestines\u0027 ability to contract and move food diminishes [88].\nGastric acid secretion diminishes [88].\nGallstones become increasingly common [88].\nDecreased elasticity of anal sphincter causes fecal incontinence [88].\nRenal filtration function declines by 50% from 20 to 90 [89].\nKidney mass decreases 20% over the same span [90].\nBlood supply reduction

Types of Patient Moves\nemergency moves are used when there is immediate danger before full\nassessment or care [84].\nExamples include a scene that is unsafe or the patient\u0027s position prevents\nimmediate care [84].\nTechniques aim to prevent aggravation of potential spinal cord injury [85].\nCommon emergency move techniques include the clothes drag [86].\nThe blanket drag involves placing the patient on a blanket to be pulled [87].\nThe arm drag involves grasping the patient\u0027s wrists with arms extended above\ntheir head [88].\nThe arm-to-arm drag involves grasping opposite wrists through the patient\u0027s\narmpits [88].\nRemoving an unconscious patient from a vehicle alone requires specific steps\n[89].\nurgent moves are necessary for patients with conditions like altered level of\nconsciousness, inadequate ventilation, shock, or in extreme weather [92].\nThe rapid extrication technique is an urgent move for patients in a vehicle\n[93].\nThis technique is used when urgency exists and the patient must be moved\nquickly [93].\nIt can move a patient from a vehicle to a backboard in about a minute [95].\nHowever, this technique increases the risk of spinal cord injury [95].\nConsider all options before using rapid extrication [95].\nNon-urgent moves are used when the scene and patient are stable [97].\nThese moves should be carefully planned [97].\nThe direct ground lift is for patients found on the ground with no suspected\nspinal injury [98].\nIt is used when the patient needs to be carried a distance to the stretcher [99].\nTwo EMTs stand side by side to lift and carry the patient [99].\nThe extremity lift is for patients with no suspected extremity or spinal cord\ninjury [100].\nIt is useful in small spaces as it doesn\u0027t require standing side by side [101].\nOne EMT is at the head, the other at the feet [102].\nMovements are coordinated with direct verbal commands [102].\nTransfer moves include the direct carry and draw sheet method [103].\nA direct carry moves a supine patient from a bed to a stretcher with two or\nmore rescuers [103].\nThe draw sheet method uses a sheet or blanket to move a patient from bed to\nstretcher [104].\nUsing a scoop stretcher is another transfer method [104].\nOther carries include the log roll or slide to move a patient to a backboard [105]\n.\nChecking airway, breathing, and circulation is the first step if a patient is not in\nimmediate danger [168].\n4. Special Considerations and Patient Positioning\nPatient Condition Recommended Position Notes\nNo suspected injury,\nchest pain/respiratory\ndistress [138]\nPosition of comfort\n(typically Fowler or semi-\nFowler) [138]\nShock [139] Supine position [139]\nLate stages of\npregnancy [140]\nTransport on their left\nside [140]\nPosition on left side if\nuncomfortable or hypotensive\nin supine position [141]\nUnresponsive, no\nsuspected injury, hip,\nor pelvic injury [142]\nRecovery position [142]\nNauseated or\nvomiting [142]\nPosition of comfort [142]\nSuspected spinal cord\ninjury [106]\nConsider geriatricspecific\nimmobilization\ndevices like vacuum\nmattresses [107]\nSkeletal changes in older\nadults may prevent lying\nsupine on backboards/scoop\nstretchers [106]\nMost patients transported by EMS are geriatric patients [106].\nSkeletal changes in older people can lead to brittle bones, rigidity, or spinal\ncurvatures [107].\nThese changes can make lying supine on a backboard or scoop stretcher\ndifficult or injurious [107].\nConsider using geriatric-specific mobilization devices such as vacuum\nmattresses [107].\nBariatric patients (overweight or obese) present unique challenges [108].\nMoving bariatric patients takes an increasing toll on EMT health [108].\nBack injuries are a major cause of missed workdays for EMTs [109].\nEquipment with higher capacity is being developed, but user danger remains\n[109].\nSpecial bariatric techniques, equipment, and resources are needed for\npatients over 350 pounds [63].\nExamples of bariatric equipment include specialized stretchers [112].\nMnemonic or electric-powered stretchers limit the risk of injury [114].\nPatients must be properly positioned based on their chief complaint [137].\nPatients with chest pain or respiratory distress and no suspected injury\nshould be placed in a position of comfort, usually Fowler or semi-Fowler [138].\nPatients in shock should be placed in the supine position [139].\nLate-stage pregnant patients should be transported on their left side [140].\nThe left-side position is especially important if they are uncomfortable or\nhypotensive in the supine position [141].\nAn unresponsive patient without suspected injury should be placed in the\nrecovery position [142].\nPatients who are nauseated or vomiting should be transported in a position of\ncomfort [142].\nBefore using medical restraints, evaluate for correctable causes of\ncombativeness like head injury or hypoxia [143].\nFollow local protocols and obtain medical authorization for restraints [143].\nRestraining a patient typically requires a minimum of five people: one for each\nextremity and one for the head [144].\nOne EMT should be the team leader [145].\nThe patient should be in the supine position [146].\nA prone position can lead to asphyxia [146].\nApply a restraint to each extremity [147].\nRestrain the patient to a backboard with one arm above the head and the\nother by the side [148].\nAssess the patient\u0027s ABCs, mental status, and circulation after applying\nrestraints [149].\nDocument all restraint information [149].\n5. Team Coordination and Safety\nTeam actions must be coordinated when moving patients [82].\nA team leader indicates team member positions and describes the steps\nbefore lifting [82].\nThe team leader uses preparatory commands and countdowns [84].\nCarefully plan ahead by selecting methods with the least amount of lifting and\ncarrying [84].\nConsider potential sources of strain during the move [84].\nPerform a personal safety assessment before moving a patient [150].\nAsk yourself if you are physically strong enough [151].\nAssess if there is adequate room for a proper stance [151].\nDetermine if additional personnel are needed for assistance [151].\nInjured EMTs cannot provide help [151].\nEquipment decontamination is essential after use [135].\ndecontamination protects the safety of yourself, the crew, and future patients\n[135].\nIt also prevents the spread of disease [135].\nKnow and follow local standard operating procedures for disinfecting\nequipment [136].",

Types of Healthcare Teams\n3. Essential Elements for Effective Team Performance A\n4. Patient Care Transfer and Collaboration A\n5. Decision Making and Conflict Resolution in Teams A\n6. Review of Key Concepts A\n1. Introduction to the Team Approach in Healthcare\nThe team approach to healthcare is significant. [2]\nIt impacts positive patient outcomes. [2]\nAs an EMT, you are a critical member of this team. [4]\nThe team includes first responders, paramedics, and other EMTs. [5]\nIt also involves physicians, nurses, and other personnel. [5]\nThey help the patient throughout their illness or injury. [5]\nA key goal is inherently safe EMS systems. [6]\nThese systems minimize exposure to injury and infection. [6]\nThe culture of safety involves data collection and resources. [7]\nIt also includes EMS education and safety standards. [7]\nReporting and investigating errors is part of this culture. [7]\nPrevious models had providers working separately. [9]\nThey passed the patient from one individual to the next. [9]\nWorking as a uniform team improves performance. [10]\nThis includes first patient contact to discharge. [10]\nPatient safety and outcomes are also improved. [10]\n2. Types of Healthcare Teams\nThere are different types of teams. [14]\nYou have regular teams and temporary teams. [15]\nRegular teams consist of EMTs. [16]\nThey constantly interact with the same partner. [16]\nThey are more likely to move smoothly through procedures. [17]\nTemporary teams work with providers they don\u0027t regularly interact with.\n[17]\nProviders must work collaboratively. [17]\nSpecial teams are another type. [19]\nThese include fire teams and rescue teams. [19]\nHazmat and tactical teams are examples. [19]\nSpecial event EMS teams and bike teams exist. [19]\nIn-hospital patient care techs and MIH technicians are included. [19]\nThere is a difference between groups and teams. [20]\nNIMS defines a group by functional level of operation. [21]\nGroups perform special functions. [22]\nA group consists of independent healthcare providers. [23]\nThey work independently to help the patient. [23]\nExamples are triage, transport, or treatment groups. [23]\nA team is a group of providers with specific roles. [24]\nThey work interdependently under a leader. [24]\nEssential elements of a group include a common goal. [24]\nThey have an image of themselves as a group. [24]\nThey have a sense of community and shared values. [24]\nThere are different roles within the group. [24]\nThere are dependent, independent, and interdependent groups. [25]\nIn dependent groups, individuals are told what and how to do things. [25]\nThis is done by their supervisor or leader. [25]\nIn independent groups, each individual is responsible for their area. [26]\nIn interdependent groups, everyone works together. [26]\nThey have shared responsibilities and accountability. [27]\nThey work towards a common goal. [27]\n2. Types of Healthcare Teams\nTeam Type Characteristics Interaction\nFrequency\nRegular Teams EMTs work consistently with the same\npartner. [16]\nFrequent and\nconsistent. [16]\nTemporary\nTeams\nEMTs work with providers they don\u0027t\nregularly interact with or know. [17]\nInfrequent or initial.\n[17]\n3. Essential Elements for Effective Team Performance\nEffective team performance requires a shared goal. [28]\nEvery provider must be committed to the goal. [28]\nClear roles and responsibilities are needed. [29]\nEach provider must know their tasks and expectations. [29]\nA diverse and competent skill set is important. [30]\nTeam members should practice together. [30]\nThey should be familiar with each other\u0027s tools and techniques. [30]\nEffective collaboration and communication are vital. [31]\nTeam communication includes clear messages. [31]\nClosed-loop communication is an element. [31]\nCourtesy and constructive intervention are also important. [31]\nSupportive and coordinated leadership is necessary. [32]\nThe team leader assigns roles and provides oversight. [33]\nThey offer centralized decision making. [33]\nLeaders support the team to achieve goals. [33]\nTeam leaders foster communication and dynamics. [34]\nThey use concepts like crew resource management (crm). [34]\nTeam situational awareness is also used. [34]\nCRM helps teams develop a shared understanding. [36]\nIt is a way for team members to work together. [36]\nCRM recommends using the pace mnemonic. [36]\nPACE stands for Probe, Alert, Challenge, Emergency. [37]\n4. Patient Care Transfer and Collaboration\nPatient care is transferred at several points. [38]\nThis transfer is also called handing off care. [38]\nThese transfers can introduce critical errors. [39]\nErrors are possible especially with multiple transfers. [39]\nEffective teams minimize the number of transfers. [40]\nThey adhere to strict guidelines for transfers. [40]\nVerbal transfer of care should ensure uninterrupted critical care. [41]\nThere should be minimal interference. [41]\nRespectful interaction is important. [41]\nTeams should have common priorities. [41]\nCommon language systems should be used. [41]\nBasic life support efforts must continue. [43]\nThis continues throughout the continuum of care. [43]\nEfforts must be coordinated with advanced life support. [44]\nAdvanced providers use advanced tools and techniques. [44]\nA paramedic-only skill in one system might be an EMT skill in another. [45]\nIt is your responsibility to understand your scope of practice. [46]\nStandard of care and local protocols are also important. [46]\n5. Decision Making and Conflict Resolution in Teams\nEffective decisions are based on sound knowledge. [48]\nInformation comes from the patient and history. [48]\nPhysical examination also provides information. [48]\nThere are stages in the decision-making process. [49]\nThese stages include pre-arrival, arrival, during the call, and after the call. [49]\nDecision making begins with initial dispatch information. [49]\nMentally rehearse needed care steps. [49]\nDesignate a leader in the pre-arrival stage. [49]\nCrew members discuss their roles. [49]\nOn arrival, provide a scene size-up. [50]\nRequest additional resources if needed. [50]\nAssess and intervene for life threats immediately. [50]\nDuring the call, the team leader gathers information. [51]\nThey interpret the data and develop a plan. [51]\nThe plan is communicated to the team. [51]\nThe plan is then implemented. [51]\nEvaluate the effect of the decision. [51]\nAfter the call, debrief and talk about what happened. [52]\nListen to feedback with an open mind. [53]\nThere are decision traps in critical thinking. [54]\nThese traps frequently lead to errors. [55]\ndecision traps include bias, anchoring, and overconfidence. [55]\nbiases are fixed beliefs about something. [56]\nanchoring occurs when one cause is settled on early. [56]\nOther options are then not considered. [56]\noverconfidence happens when abilities are overestimated. [56]\nWhen conflict occurs, use five techniques. [57]\nThe patient comes first. [57]\nDo not engage in the conflict. [57]\nKeep your cool. [57]\nSeparate the person from the issue. [57]\nChoose your battles wisely. [57]\n6. Review of Key Concepts\nA characteristic of a regular team is consistent interaction with the same\npartner. [59]\nThis allows them to perform as a seamless unit. [59]\nEssential elements of a group include shared goals. [61]\nIt is important for groups to have a set of shared goals. [61]\nMembers of an interdependent group work together. [62]\nThey have shared responsibilities and accountability. [62]\nThey work towards a common goal. [62]\nRepeating a message back to a team member is closed-loop communication.\n[64]\nA clear message is delivered calmly and concisely. [65]\nThe listener repeats it back. [65]\nA team leader is essential for team success. [66]\nWhen verbal transfer of care occurs, ensure team members are respectful.\n[68]\nIn a conflict scenario with a tired partner, it\u0027s suggested to go ahead and\ndiscuss it after. [70]",

Scene Size-Up\nscene size-up is evaluating the conditions for operation [13]. situational awareness is\nvital throughout the call [14]. Dispatch provides initial information [15].\nscene size-up combines information and observations for safe operations [16].\nEnsuring scene safety is critical [17].\nPre-hospital settings can present minor or major dangers [18].\nIf a scene is unsafe, make it safe or call for additional resources [19].\nConsider traffic safety and environmental conditions [20].\nProtect bystanders from becoming patients [22].\nHazards can include environmental, physical, chemical, electrical, water, fire,\nexplosions, and physical violence [23].\nBe aware of potential violence from patients, family, bystanders, gangs, or\ncrowds [24].\nEmergency scenes are dynamic environments [25].\nDetermine the mechanism of injury (moi) or nature of illness (NOI) [26].\nCalls can be medical, trauma, or both [27].\nTraumatic injuries result from physical force [27].\nMOI terms include blunt trauma and penetrating trauma [29].\nFor medical patients, determine the NOI [30].\nGather information from the patient, family, or bystanders [31].\nUse your senses for clues [31].\nBe aware of multiple patients with similar symptoms (e.g., carbon monoxide)\n[32]. This may indicate an unsafe scene [32].\nMOI or NOI is valuable for preparing patient care [33].\nTake standard precautions [34].\nAdapt PPE to the pre-hospital task [35].\nstandard precautions are CDC-recommended measures for dealing with\nblood, body fluids, non-intact skin, and mucous membranes [36].\nAssume all these pose an infection risk [37].\nInitiate standard precautions before patient contact [38].\nAt minimum, wear gloves before contact [39].\nConsider glasses and a mask [40].\nDetermine the number of patients [41].\nAccurately identify the total number of patients [41].\nUse the incident command system with multiple patients [42].\nBegin triage with multiple patients [42].\ntriage sorts patients based on condition severity [43].\nConsider additional resources [44].\nThis could include more ambulances, police, helicopters, or fire trucks [44].\nAdvanced life support or air medical may be needed [45].\nFire departments handle hazmat, technical rescue, extrication, or water\nrescue [46].\nLaw enforcement may be required [47].\nQuestions for determining additional resources:\nDoes the scene threaten you or the patient? [48]\nHow many patients are there? [48]\nDo you have resources for their conditions? [48]\n3. Primary Assessment\nThe primary assessment\u0027s goal is to identify and treat immediate life threats [49]. This\ninvolves physically examining the patient [49]. You assess level of consciousness,\nairway, breathing, and circulation [49].\nForm a general impression first [50].\nThis helps determine priority of care [50].\nNote age, sex, race, distress level, and overall appearance [50].\nEnsure the patient sees you approaching [51].\nNote patient position and movement [51].\nAvoid standing over the patient [52].\nAddress the patient by name and introduce yourself [53].\nAsk about the chief complaint [53].\nThe patient\u0027s response offers insight into consciousness, airway,\nbreathing, and circulation [54].\nTreat life-threatening problems immediately [55].\nDefine the patient\u0027s condition as stable, stable but potentially unstable, or\nunstable [56].\nScan for and control uncontrolled external bleeding [56]. This takes priority\n[56].\nAssess the level of consciousness (loc) [57].\nLOC indicates neurologic and physiologic status [57].\nAssessment of an unconscious patient focuses on ABCs [58].\nSustained unconsciousness suggests a critical respiratory, circulatory, or\nCNS problem [58].\nAltered LOC in conscious patients may be due to inadequate perfusion,\nmedication, drugs, alcohol, or poisoning [59].\nUse the AVPU mnemonic for responsiveness [60]. Choose one description\n[60].\nTest patients not responding to verbal stimuli for response to painful\nstimulus [60].\nPainful stimuli include pinching the arm, skin, or trap area [61]. Also apply\nupward pressure along the orbital ring [62].\nA patient moaning or withdrawing responds to stimulus [62].\nOrient and test mental status by checking memory and thinking [63].\nEvaluate ability to remember: Person (name), Place (location), Time (year,\nmonth, date), and Event (what\u0027s happening) [64].\nAnswering all is being alert and oriented times four (A\u0026Ox4) [64].\nAny deviation from A\u0026Ox4 or baseline is altered mental status [65].\nIdentify and treat life threats [66].\nConditions causing sudden death are life threats [66].\nExamples include airway obstruction, respiratory failure/arrest, shock,\nsevere bleeding, or cardiac arrest [66].\nUsually, address life threats with ABC (Airway, Breathing, Circulation) [67].\nSometimes, CAB (Circulation, Airway, Breathing) is more appropriate [68].\nAssess the Airway (A) [69].\nStay alert for airway obstruction [70].\nEnsure the airway remains patent and adequate [71].\nResponsive patients talking or crying have an open airway [71].\nA conscious patient who cannot speak or cry likely has a severe\nobstruction [72].\nIf an airway problem is found, stop assessment and clear it [73].\nIf the patient has difficulty breathing and is not breathing, take immediate\ncorrective actions [73].\nAssess airway patency in unresponsive patients [74].\nUse the jaw thrust maneuver for potential trauma to open the airway [75].\nIf jaw thrust doesn\u0027t work or trauma is ruled out, use the head tilt chin lift\nmaneuver [76].\nSigns of obstruction in an unconscious patient: obvious trauma, blood,\nobstruction, noisy breathing (snoring, bubbling, gurgling, crowing, stridor),\nextremely shallow or absent breathing [76].\nAssess Breathing (B) [77].\nEnsure the patient\u0027s breathing is present and adequate after ensuring a\npatent airway [77].\nAsk: Is the patient breathing? Is it adequate? Is the patient hypoxic? [79].\nPerform positive pressure ventilation for patients not breathing, or whose\nbreathing is too slow or shallow [79].\nIf breathing is adequate but hypoxic, administer oxygen [80].\nOxygenation goal for most patients is 94-99% saturation [81].\nIf difficulty breathing develops after primary assessment, re-evaluate the\nairway immediately [82].\nConsider positive pressure ventilations with an airway adjunct when\nrespirations exceed 28, are fewer than 8, or are too shallow for adequate\nexchange [83].\nShallow respirations show little chest wall movement [83].\nObserve effort required for breathing [83]. Look for retractions, accessory\nmuscle use, nasal flaring [83].\nNote two-to-three word dyspnea (shortness of breath when talking) [83].\nLook for the tripod position (sitting up and leaning forward) or labored\nbreathing [84].\nrespiratory distress is increased effort and rate [85].\nrespiratory failure is inadequate oxygenation or ventilation [85].\nrespiratory failure can lead to respiratory arrest if uncorrected [86].\nAssess Circulation (C) [87].\nEvaluate by assessing mental status, pulse, and skin condition [87].\nThese are the three parts of circulation assessment [88].\nAssess the pulse [89]. Palpate if a pulse is present [89].\nResponsive patients older than one year: palpate radial pulse at the wrist\n[90].\nUnresponsive patients older than one year: palpate carotid pulse at the\nneck [91].\nChildren under one year: palpate brachial pulse in the upper arm [91].\nIf a pulse cannot be palpated in an unresponsive patient, start CPR [92].\nAssess skin condition for perfusion [93]. Evaluate skin color, temperature,\ncondition, and capillary refill [94].\nSkin color: Pale, white, ashen, or gray indicates poor peripheral circulation\n[95]. Abnormally flushed or red can indicate high blood pressure [96]. Blue\nindicates low oxygen saturation (cyanosis) [96].\nSkin temperature: Normal is warm [97]. Abnormal is hot, cold, cool, or\nclammy [98].\nMoisture: Normal is dry [99]. Wet, moist, or excessively dry/hot suggests a\nproblem [99].\ncapillary refill is evaluated in pediatric patients [100]. It assesses circulation\nto capillary beds in fingers and toes [100].\nCap refill should restore within two seconds [101].\nTest by gently pushing a fingertip until it blanches white [101]. Release and\ncount how long it takes for the pink color to return [102]. Should be less\nthan two seconds [102].\nAssess and control any external bleeding [103]. This should occur before\naddressing airway or breathing [103].\nBleeding from a large vein is a steady flow [104].\nBleeding from an artery is characterized by spurting [104].\nControl bleeding by applying direct pressure [105].\nIf direct pressure fails or there is obvious arterial hemorrhage, apply a\ntourniquet [105].\nPerform a rapid scan to identify life threats [106].\nIdentify injuries needing management or protection before transport [106].\nThis is a 60-90 second exam [106].\nIt is not a systematic or focused physical exam [106].\nDetermine patient priority and transport (D) [107]. This follows ABC [107].\nHigh-priority patients include those who are unresponsive, have difficulty\nbreathing, or uncontrolled bleeding [108].\nOther high-priority conditions: altered LOC, severe chest pain, pale\nskin/poor perfusion signs, complicated childbirth, or severe pain [108].\nLoad and go for high-priority patients [108].\nThe golden hour (or Golden Period) is the time from injury to definitive\ncare [109]. Treatment of shock and traumatic injuries must occur then to\nmaximize survival [109].\nImmediate transport is key for patients needing care the EMT cannot\nprovide [109].\nThe timeline: Discovery/EMS activation (first 20 minutes), platinum 10\nminutes (initial assessment, intervention, packaging, getting off scene),\nEMS transport/hospital stabilization [110].\nTransport decisions are made at this point [111].\nDecisions are based on patient condition, availability of advanced care,\ntransport distance, and local protocols [112].\nStep Action\nGeneral Impression Note age, sex, race, distress, appearance; determine care\npriority [50]\nAssess LOC (AVPU) Use AVPU to determine responsiveness; check orientation\n(Person, Place, Time, Event) [60]\nIdentify Life Threats Recognize conditions causing sudden death (airway,\nbreathing, circulation, bleeding) [66]\nAirway Assessment Ensure patent airway; check for obstruction signs; use\nmaneuvers if needed [70]\nBreathing\nAssessment\nCheck presence and adequacy; assess rate, rhythm,\nquality, depth; administer oxygen/ventilate [77]\nCirculation\nAssessment\nAssess mental status, pulse, skin condition; control external\nbleeding [87]\nRapid Scan Quickly identify any other life threats [106]\nPriority/Transport Determine patient priority (high priority conditions); decide\non transport [107]\n4. History Taking\nhistory taking is the next part of patient assessment [113]. It includes the patient\u0027s\nhistory and the history of the present illness [113]. This provides details about the\nchief complaint and symptoms [114].\nDocument the date, patient age, gender, race, medical history, and current\nhealth status [114].\nInvestigate the chief complaint and history of the present illness [115].\nBegin by introducing yourself and making the patient comfortable [115]. Obtain\npermission to treat [115].\nAsk simple, direct questions [116]. Use Mr., Miss, or Mrs. with the patient\u0027s last\nname [116].\nUse open-ended questions to determine the chief complaint [116].\nUse eye contact to encourage the patient to speak [116]. Repeat statements to\nshow understanding [116].\nIf the patient is unresponsive, get information from family or bystanders [117].\nLook for medical alert jewelry or documentation [119].\nUse the OPQRST mnemonic to gather information on the present illness [121].\nOnset: When the problem started [122].\nProvocation: What makes the problem better or worse? [123]\nQuality: How would you describe the feeling (pain, stabbing, pressure)?\n[124]\nRegion/Radiation: Where the problem is and if it spreads [124].\nSeverity: On a scale of 0-10, how bad is the pain? [124]\nTiming: When did it start? Is it constant or intermittent? [124]\nIdentify pertinent negatives: negative findings that don\u0027t require care or\nintervention [121].\nObtain the SAMPLE history [125].\nSigns and symptoms [125].\nAllergies [125].\nMedications [125].\nPast pertinent medical history [125].\nLast oral intake [125].\nEvents leading up to the illness or injury [125].\nOPQRST is for the present illness, SAMPLE is for the patient history [125].\nCritical thinking is essential in assessment [126].\nGather facts for clinical decision making [126].\nEvaluate what the information means [126].\nSynthesize information into a plan for managing the scene/patient care\n[126].\nTaking history on sensitive topics requires a professional approach [127].\nAlcohol or drugs: Signs can be confused or hidden [127]. Patients may\ndeny problems [127]. History from dependent patients may be unreliable\n[128]. Do not judge [129].\nPhysical abuse or violence: Report all abuse/domestic violence to\nauthorities [130]. Follow state laws and local protocols [131]. Do not accuse;\ninvolve law enforcement immediately [132]. This is mandatory reporting\n[133].\nSexual history: May be sensitive [133]. Consider all female patients of\nchildbearing age with lower abdominal pain pregnant until ruled out [134].\nAsk about last menstrual period [135]. Inquire about urinary symptoms with\nmale patients [135]. Ask about potential STDs when appropriate [135].\nSpecial challenges in history taking [136].\nSilence: Patience is important [137]. Closed-ended questions (yes/no) may\nwork best [138]. Consider if silence is a clue to the chief complaint [138].\nOverly talkative patients: Reasons can include caffeine, nervousness,\ndrug use (crack, cocaine, methamphetamines), or physiological issues [139]\n.\nMultiple symptoms: Prioritize complaints like in triage [140]. Start with the\nmost serious [140].\nAnxiety: Recognize it may be a sign of a serious medical condition [141].\nCommon in disaster scenes [142]. Anxious patients may show signs of\nshock (pale, sweating, shortness of breath, numbness/ tingling, dizziness,\nloss of consciousness) [143]. Anxiety can indicate low blood sugar, shock,\nor hypoxia [143].\nAnger and hostility: Family or bystanders may direct anger at you [145].\nRemain calm, reassuring, and gentle [145]. Retreat if the scene is unsafe\nuntil secured [146].\nIntoxication: Do not corner an intoxicated patient [147]. Potential for\nviolence is high [147]. Alcohol dulls senses [148].\nCrying: A patient may be sad, in pain, or overwhelmed [149]. Remain calm,\npatient, reassuring, and confident [150]. Maintain a soft voice [150].\nDepression: A leading cause of disability [151]. Symptoms include sadness,\nhopelessness, restlessness, irritability, sleeping/eating disorders,\ndecreased energy [152]. Being a good listener is effective [153].\nLimited cognitive abilities: Keep questions simple; limit medical terms\n[154]. Be alert for partial answers; keep asking questions [155]. Rely on\nfamily, caregivers, or friends for answers with severely limited cognitive\nfunction [156].\nCultural challenges: Don\u0027t use medical language [157]. Some cultures\nprefer same-gender healthcare providers [158]. Gain assistance from\nfriends, family, or same-culture providers if possible [158].\nLanguage barriers: Find an interpreter if possible [159]. Determine if the\npatient understands who you are [159]. Keep questions straightforward and\nbrief [160]. Use hand signals or gestures if needed [160]. Be aware of\ncommunity language diversity [161].\nHearing problems: Ask slowly and clearly [162]. Use a stethoscope as a\nhearing aid [162]. Learn simple sign language or use paper/pencil [163].\nVisual impairments: Identify yourself verbally upon entering [164]. Return\nmoved items to their previous position [165]. Explain each step of\nassessment and vital signs [165]. Notify the patient before lifting or moving\nthem [166].\n5. Secondary Assessment\nThe secondary assessment is the fourth section [168]. If the patient is stable and has\nan isolated complaint, perform it at the scene [169]. If not, perform it in the ambulance\nen route to the hospital [169].\nSometimes, there isn\u0027t time for a secondary assessment [171]. Continue\nmanaging life threats during transport [171].\nThe purpose is to perform a systematic physical exam [172].\nThis may be a focused assessment based on the chief complaint or a certain\nbody area/system [172].\nHow to assess during the physical exam: inspect, palpate, auscultate, and\npercuss [172]. Look, listen, and feel [172].\nInspect: Look at the patient for abnormalities [173].\nPalpate: Feel for abnormalities [174].\nAuscultate: Listen with a stethoscope [174].\nThe mnemonic DCAP-BTLS helps remember what to look for in trauma\nassessments [175].\nCompare findings on one side of the body to the other [176].\nDeformities [177]\nContusions [177]\nAbrasions [177]\nPunctures or penetrations [177]\nBurns [177]\nTenderness [177]\nLaceration [177]\nSwelling [177]\nThe systematic assessment\u0027s goal is to identify hidden injuries [178].\nPerform a focused assessment on patients with non-significant MOIs or\nmedical patients [180]. It is typically based on the chief complaint [180].\nFocus attention on the affected body part or system [180].\nRespiratory system focus (for difficulty breathing) [181]:\nExpose and inspect the chest for obstruction signs or trauma [182].\nInspect chest symmetry (both sides rising/falling) [183].\nAuscultate and listen to breath sounds, noting abnormalities [184].\nMeasure respiratory rate, chest rise/fall (tidal volume), and effort [184].\nLook for retractions and increased work of breathing [185].\nObtain RRQ (respiratory rate, rhythm, quality, depth) [187].\nNormal adult rate is 12-20 breaths/minute [188]. Children breathe faster\n[189]. Count breaths in 30 seconds and multiply by two [189].\nRespiratory rhythm should be regular or irregular [190]. Regular means\nconsistent time between chest rises [190]. Irregular can indicate an\nunderlying medical or trauma condition [191].\nQuality of breathing: Normal is silent [192]. Other sounds (advantageous\nbreath sounds) indicate respiratory problems [192].\nDepth of breathing: Amount of air exchanged, depends on tidal rate\nand volume [193].\nAuscultate breath sounds on both sides and multiple lung fields [193].\nListen for: Normal, snoring (upper respiratory), wheezing (lower),\ncrackles (lower), rhonchi (lower), stridor (upper) [194].\nCardiovascular system focus (for chest pain) [198]:\nLook for trauma to the chest; listen for breath sounds [198].\nConsider pulse, respiratory rate, and blood pressure [199].\nPay attention to rate, quality, and rhythm of the pulse [199].\nConsider skin findings [200].\nCheck and compare distal pulses for differences [201].\nConsider auscultation for abnormal heart tones [201].\nPulse: Normal adult resting pulse is 60-100 [202]. Younger patients have\nfaster rates [203].\nAssess pulse RRQ (rate, rhythm, quality) [204].\nPulse quality: Strong or bounding [205]. Weak or thready is difficult to\nfeel [205].\nPulse rhythm: Regular or irregular [206]. Regular has consistent intervals\n[206]. Irregular means early or late beats or missed beats [208].\nTake blood pressure [209]. It\u0027s the pressure against artery walls [209].\nLow blood pressure (hypotension) can indicate blood/fluid loss, loss of\nvascular tone, or cardiac problems [209]. It is a late sign of shock [210].\nHigh blood pressure (hypertension) can result in rupture or damage\n[210].\nBlood pressure cuff components: wide upper cuff, inflatable bladder,\nbulb pump/valve, pressure gauge [212].\nAuscultation is a common way to measure BP [213].\nPalpation (feeling) can be used in certain cases (blood pressure by\npalp) [214].\nNeurologic system focus (for mental status changes, head injury, stupor,\ndizziness, drowsiness, syncope) [216]:\nEvaluate level of consciousness and orientation using AVPU or\nGlasgow Coma Scale (GCS) [216]. GCS provides info on mental status\nchanges [218].\nAssess pupils [219]. Normally round, equal size, and adjust to light [219].\nPupil size and reactivity reflect brain status, perfusion, oxygenation,\nand condition [220].\nPupils dilate in the absence of light [221].\nUnequal pupils (anisocoria) can indicate altered brain function, though\na small population has unequal pupils normally [222].\nUse the PEARL mnemonic: Pupils Equal And Round, Regular in size,\nand Reactive to Light [222].\nAssess neurovascular status with a hands-on assessment [223].\nDetermine sensory and motor response [223].\nLook for bilateral muscle strength and weakness [223].\nComplete a thorough sensory assessment [224]. Test for pain sensation\nand position [224].\nCompare distal and proximal sensory and motor responses side to side\n[224].\nFor trauma situations, perform the DCAP-BTLS assessment on all body\nregions [226].\nHead, neck, and cervical spine: palpate, check eyes, cheekbones, ears\n(look for fluid), maxilla, mandible, mouth (broken teeth, odors) [227].\nChest: look, listen, and feel [227].\nAbdomen: palpate for tenderness, rigidity, guarding [228]. Palpate the four\nquadrants (left upper/lower, right upper/lower) [228].\nPelvis: inspect for symmetry [229].\nExtremities: check for DCAP-BTLS, pulses, motor, and sensory function\n[229].\nRoll the patient (often onto a backboard) [230]. Inspect the back for DCAPBTLS,\nsymmetry, open wounds [231]. Palpate the spine from neck to pelvis\nfor tenderness or deformity [232].\nComponent Focus\nSystematic\nExam\nInspect, palpate, auscultate, percuss [172]\nFocused\nAssessment\nBased on chief complaint or affected system (e.g., respiratory,\ncardiovascular, neurologic) [172]\nTrauma\nAssessment\nDCAP-BTLS on all body regions (Head, Neck, Spine, Chest,\nAbdomen, Pelvis, Extremities, Back) [175]\nVital Signs Pulse, Respiratory Rate, Blood Pressure, Skin (Color, Temp,\nCondition), Capillary Refill, using devices (Pulse Ox,\nCapnography) [234]\n6. Vital Signs and Reassessment\nAssessing vital signs is the next area [234]. Use appropriate monitoring devices, but\nthey don\u0027t replace a comprehensive assessment [235].\nMonitoring devices:\nPulse oximetry: Evaluates oxygenation effectiveness; measures oxygen\nsaturation [235]. Patients with difficulty breathing should get oxygen\nregardless of pulse ox reading [235].\nCapnography: Provides information on patient ventilation, circulation, and\nmetabolism [236].\nBlood glucose/glucometry: Measures blood sugar level [237].\nNBP (Non-invasive blood pressure) measurement [237].\nreassessment is the very last part [238].\nPerform reassessment at regular intervals [238].\nPurpose: Identify and treat changes in the patient\u0027s condition [238].\nSteps in reassessment:\nRepeat the primary assessment [238].\nReassess vital signs [238]. Compare baseline vitals to subsequent ones\nto look for trends (e.g., BP changes, heart rate changes) [238].\nReassess the chief complaint [238].\nRecheck interventions [238].\nDocument any changes and whether they were positive or negative [239].\nIdentify and treat the patient\u0027s condition [239].\nReassess unstable patients every five minutes [240]. It is a continuous process\n[241].",

[2]\nIt involves recognizing and managing adequate and inadequate breathing.\n[2]\nMaintaining an open airway is a primary component of addressing life\nthreats. [5]\nWhen breathing is disrupted, oxygen delivery to tissues is compromised. [6]\nOxygen reaches body cells through breathing and circulation. [6]\n2. Anatomy of the Respiratory System\nAirway\nDivision\nStructures Functions\nUpper Airway Nose, mouth, oral cavity, pharynx,\nlarynx (above vocal cords)\nWarm, filter, and\nhumidify air [10]\nLower Airway Trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, alveoli\n(below vocal cords)\nDeliver oxygen to\nalveoli [32]\nThe pharynx is a muscular tube extending from the nose and mouth. [11]\nIt includes the nasopharynx, oral pharynx, and laryngopharynx. [12]\nThe nasopharynx filters, warms, and humidifies air. [14]\nThe oropharynx is the posterior part of the oral cavity. [16]\nThe epiglottis helps prevent food and liquid from entering the larynx. [16]\nThe larynx is a complex structure of cartilage. [18]\nIt marks the division between the upper and lower airways. [19]\nKey structures include the thyroid cartilage (Adam\u0027s apple), cricoid\ncartilage, and cricothyroid membrane. [20]\nThe glottic opening is the narrowest part of the adult airway. [27]\nvocal cords produce speech and protect the trachea. [29]\nThe trachea is the air entry to the lungs. [32]\nIt begins below the cricoid cartilage. [33]\nIt divides at the carina into the main stem bronchi. [35]\nBronchi distribute oxygen to the lungs and divide into smaller bronchioles. [36]\nBronchioles are smooth muscle and dilate or constrict. [41]\nalveoli are the site of oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange. [42]\nThey are thin-walled sacs surrounded by pulmonary capillaries. [43]\nOxygen diffuses into capillaries, and carbon dioxide diffuses out. [44]\nThe mediastinum is the area between the lungs. [48]\nIt contains the heart, great vessels, esophagus, trachea, bronchi, and\nnerves. [48]\nThe phrenic nerve is necessary for the diaphragm to contract for breathing.\n[50]\n3. Physiology of Breathing\nThe respiratory and cardiovascular systems work together. [52]\nThey ensure a constant supply of oxygen and nutrients. [52]\nThey remove carbon dioxide and waste products. [53]\nventilation is the physical act of moving air. [55]\nIt is necessary for oxygenation and respiration. [55]\nInhalation is the active part of breathing. [57]\nThe diaphragm and intercostal muscles contract. [58]\nThis creates negative pressure in the thorax. [59]\nAir enters the body and travels to the lungs. [59]\nPartial pressure is the amount of gas in air or dissolved in fluid. [62]\nOxygen and carbon dioxide diffuse until partial pressures are equal. [66]\ntidal volume measures the depth of breathing. [69]\nThe average adult tidal volume is about 500 milliliters. [70]\nDead space is inspired air that does not reach the alveoli. [71]\nExhalation is a passive process. [73]\nMuscular effort is not required. [73]\nDiaphragm and intercostal muscles relax, decreasing thorax size. [74]\nAir pressure increases, pushing air out. [74]\nRegulation of ventilation involves receptors and feedback loops. [75]\nThese sense gas concentrations and adjust breathing rate and depth. [76]\nhypoxia is a condition where tissues cannot get enough oxygen. [77]\nThe hypoxic drive uses oxygen to control breathing. [80]\nIt is typically seen in patients with end-stage COPD. [81]\noxygenation is loading oxygen molecules onto hemoglobin. [82]\nIt is required for internal respiration. [83]\nventilation without oxygenation can occur in low-oxygen environments.\n[84]\nrespiration is the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide. [85]\nThis occurs in the alveoli and body tissues. [85]\nMetabolism is cellular respiration, producing energy and waste. [86]\nExternal respiration is the exchange in the alveoli and pulmonary capillaries.\n[88]\nSurfactant reduces surface tension in alveoli, aiding gas exchange. [89]\nInternal respiration is the exchange between the systemic circulatory system\nand cells. [91]\nOxygen moves from blood to tissues, and carbon dioxide moves from cells\nto blood. [92]\nCells need a constant supply of oxygen for aerobic metabolism. [93]\nWithout adequate oxygen, anaerobic metabolism occurs, which is\ninsufficient. [94]\n4. Pathophysiology of the Respiratory System\nFactor Description Examples\nNervous System Input Chemoreceptors monitor\ngas and ion levels,\nstimulating respiratory\ncenters.\nIncreased carbon dioxide or\nhydrogen ions lead to\nincreased respiratory rate.\n[97]\nVentilation/Perfusion\nMismatch\nFailure to match ventilation\nand perfusion leads to\nabnormal gas exchange.\nBlood passes over alveoli\nwithout gas exchange. [101]\nIntrinsic Factors Conditions within the body\naffecting ventilation.\nAirway obstruction,\ninfections, allergic\nreactions,\nunresponsiveness (tongue).\n[105]\nExtrinsic Factors External factors affecting\nventilation.\nTrauma causing airway\nobstruction. [106]\nFactors Affecting\nRespiration\nConditions affecting gas\nexchange at the alveolar or\ntissue level.\nExternal: Low atmospheric\nor partial pressure of\noxygen. [109]\nInternal Factors Conditions reducing\nsurface area for gas\nexchange or decreasing\noxygen supply.\nPneumonia, pulmonary\nedema, COPD. [110]\nCirculatory\nCompromise\nObstruction of blood flow\nto cells and tissues.\nTrauma (pneumothorax,\nhemothorax), blood loss,\nanemia, shock. [111]\nchemoreceptors provide feedback to the respiratory centers in the brain. [96]\nStimulation from the pons affects the rate and depth of respirations. [98]\nA ventilation and perfusion mismatch is a common cause of abnormal gas\nexchange. [100]\nThis occurs when ventilation is compromised but perfusion continues. [101]\nIt can also occur when perfusion across the alveolar membrane is\ndisrupted. [104]\nIntrinsic factors are inside the body. [105]\nUnresponsiveness can cause the tongue to block the airway. [105]\nExtrinsic factors are outside the body. [106]\nTrauma is an example. [107]\nFactors affecting respiration can be external (environmental) or internal\n(conditions). [109]\nCirculatory compromise can be caused by trauma or other conditions. [111]\n5. Patient Assessment of the Respiratory System\nWear a mask and protective eyewear during aerosol generating procedures\n(AGP). [113]\nAGPs include CPR, nebulizer treatments, and CPAP. [114]\nRecognizing adequate breathing is important. [115]\nNormal breathing in adults is 12 to 20 breaths per minute. [115]\nSigns include a regular pattern, clear and equal lung sounds, and regular\nchest rise and fall at an adequate depth. [116]\nSigns of abnormal breathing include: [117]\nFewer than 12 or more than 20 breaths per minute with shortness of\nbreath. [117]\nIrregular rhythm or diminished breath sounds. [119]\nReduced flow of expired air at the nose or mouth. [120]\nUnequal or inadequate chest expansion. [121]\nIncreased effort using accessory muscles. [122]\nShallow depth, reducing tidal volume. [123]\nPale, cyanotic, cool, or moist skin. [124]\nSkin pulling in around the ribs or above the clavicles (retractions). [124]\nagonal gasps are occasional gasping breaths after the heart has stopped.\n[125]\nAbnormal respiratory patterns include: [126]\nCheyne-Stokes respirations: increasing rate and depth followed by\napnea, often seen in stroke or head injury. [126]\nAtaxic respirations: irregular or unidentifiable pattern, may follow serious\nhead injuries. [127]\nKussmaul respirations: deep, rapid respirations, commonly seen in\nmetabolic acidosis. [129]\nPatients with inadequate breathing need immediate treatment. [130]\nThis includes airway management, supplemental oxygen, and ventilatory\nsupport. [130]\nAssessment of respiration considers factors like high altitudes or poisonous\ngases. [132]\nLevel of consciousness and skin color are indicators of respirations. [133]\npulse oximetry (SpO2) measures the percentage of hemoglobin bound to\noxygen. [134]\nSpO2 should be greater than 94% when breathing room air. [134]\nOxygen is applied when SpO2 is less than 94% in conditions like stroke or\nheart attack. [135]\nPulse ox values may take time to reflect changes. [136]\nIt is a routine vital sign. [137]\nend tidal co2 measures the maximal CO2 concentration at the end of\nexhalation. [138]\nLow CO2 may indicate hyperventilation or decreased CO2 return. [138]\nHigh CO2 may indicate CO2 retention or apnea. [139]\nIt is measured using capnometry (numeric reading) and capnography\n(numeric reading and graph). [140]\nNormal range is 35 to 45 millimeters mercury. [142]\n6. Opening the Airway\nManeuver Indication Technique\nHead-Tilt\nChin-Lift\nNo spinal cervical\nspine injury\nsuspected. [148]\nPlace heel of hand on forehead, apply\nbackward pressure, place fingertips\nunder jaw and lift upward. [149]\nJaw-Thrust Cervical spine injury\nsuspected. [150]\nKneel above head, place fingers behind\njaw angles, move jaw upward using\nthumbs. [150]\nEmergency care starts with ensuring an open airway. [143]\nThe patient should be in the supine position. [144]\nUnconscious patients should be moved as a unit due to potential spinal\ninjury. [145]\nThe most common airway obstruction in an unconscious patient is the\ntongue. [146]\nIt falls back into the throat when muscles relax. [146]\nThe head tilt chin lift maneuver opens the airway in most patients. [147]\nIt is used when spinal cord trauma is not suspected. [148]\nThe jaw thrust maneuver is used when spinal cord injury is suspected. [150]\nTo open the mouth, use the cross finger technique. [151]\nPlace index finger and thumb tips on teeth, push thumb on lower teeth\nand index finger on upper teeth. [151]\n7. Suctioning\nYou must keep the airway clear to ventilate properly. [154]\nIf the airway is not clear, fluids can be forced into the lungs, causing\naspiration. [155]\nIf you hear gurgling, the patient needs suctioning. [156]\nSuction equipment can be portable (hand-operated) or fixed (mounted). [158]\nPortable units must provide enough vacuum pressure and flow. [159]\nFixed units should generate airflow over 40 liters per minute and vacuum\nover 300 mmHg. [161]\nEquipment should include wide bore, non-kinking tubing. [161]\nPlastic or rigid pharyngeal suction tips (tonsil tips, yankauer tips) are\nused. [162]\nNon-rigid plastic catheters (French or whistle tip) are used for the nose\nor liquid secretions. [164]\nSuction units should have a disposable collection bottle. [166]\nA water supply is needed for rinsing tips. [166]\nMeasure the proper size using the technique for an oropharyngeal airway. [167]\nInspect suction equipment regularly. [168]\nOperating the suction unit involves checking assembly, testing vacuum\npressure, and selecting the attachment. [169]\nNever suction the mouth or nose for more than 15 seconds for an adult, 10\nseconds for a child, or 5 seconds for an infant. [171]\nSuctioning can result in hypoxia. [172]\nRinse the catheter and tubing with water to prevent clogging. [172]\nRepeat suctioning only after the patient has been adequately ventilated or\nre-oxygenated. [173]\nAvoid touching the back of the airway with the catheter to prevent activating\nthe gag reflex. [173]\nIf secretions or vomit cannot be suctioned easily, remove the catheter, log roll\nthe patient onto their side, and clear the mouth with a gloved finger. [174]\nFor frothy secretions with assisted ventilation, alternate suctioning for 15\nseconds (less for infants/children) and ventilating for two minutes. [176]\n8. Airway Adjuncts\nAdjunct Purpose Indications Contraindications\nOropharyngeal\nAirway (OPA)\nKeeps the\ntongue from\nblocking the\nupper airway,\nfacilitates\nsuctioning. [180]\nUnresponsive\npatient without a\ngag reflex, apneic\npatient being\nventilated with\nBVM. [181]\nConscious patients or\nany patient with a gag\nreflex. [181]\nNasopharyngeal\nAirway (NPA)\nUsed with\npatients who\nSemi-conscious or\nunconscious\nSevere head injury\nwith blood from nose,\nhave an intact\ngag reflex but\ncannot maintain\nairway. [184]\npatient with an\nintact gag reflex,\npatients not\ntolerating OPA.\n[184]\nfractured nasal bone\nhistory. [185]\nBasic airway adjuncts prevent upper airway obstruction by the tongue. [179]\nAn OPA that is too large can push the tongue back, blocking the airway. [182]\nAn OPA that is too small could also block the airway like a foreign body. [182]\nInsertion techniques for OPAs can involve a 90-degree rotation if needed.\n[183]\nThe NPA is used for patients who have a gag reflex. [184]\n9. Recovery Position and Supplemental Oxygen\nThe recovery position helps maintain an airway in an unconscious patient.\n[189]\nThis is for patients who are not injured and are breathing on their own\nwith a normal rate and adequate tidal volume. [190]\nThe patient is rolled onto their left or right side. [191]\nAlways give supplemental oxygen to hypoxic patients. [192]\nDo not withhold oxygen from any patient who might benefit. [193]\nSupplemental oxygen equipment includes oxygen cylinders. [194]\nMedical oxygen is usually supplied in compressed green cylinders. [195]\nCheck the cylinder label and the stamped test date. [196]\nAluminum cylinders are tested every five years, composite every three.\n[199]\nD or jumbo D cylinder sizes are commonly used. [200]\nSafety considerations for oxygen cylinders are crucial. [203]\nHandle cylinders carefully as they are under pressure. [203]\nEnsure the correct pressure regulator is attached before transport. [203]\nA puncture can turn a tank into a deadly missile. [204]\nSecure cylinders with mounting brackets. [204]\nThe pin indexing system prevents connecting a regulator to the wrong gas\ncylinder. [206]\nPin holes on the cylinder must match the pins on the regulator. [207]\nPressure regulators reduce cylinder pressure to a usable range (40-70 PSI).\n[209]\nAttachments can be a quick connect female fitting or a flow meter. [210]\nFlow meters measure gas release in liters per minute. [213]\nPressure compensated flow meters have a float ball and must be\nupright. [214]\nBourdon gauge flow meters can be used in any position. [215]\nThere are hazards of supplemental oxygen. [217]\nCombustion: Oxygen speeds up burning, keep fire sources away. [217]\nEnsure adequate ventilation. [217]\nOxygen toxicity refers to cellular tissue damage from excessive oxygen\nlevels. [219]\nExcessive oxygen can have detrimental effects on patients with certain\ndiseases. [219]\nIncreased cellular oxygen contributes to oxygen-free radicals. [220]\nCurrent guidelines recommend tailoring oxygen therapy based on patient\nneeds. [223]\nAdminister oxygen to maintain oxygen saturation at or above 94 percent\nwhen possible. [224]\nAdminister oxygen for patients with signs of MI, heart failure, shortness of\nbreath, or room air saturation less than 94%. [221]\nhypoxia is considered much worse than oxygen toxicity. [222]\n10. Oxygen Delivery Equipment\nEquipment\nType\nDescription Flow Rate \u0026\nDelivered Oxygen\nConcentration\nNotes\nNonrebreathing\nMask\nMask with reservoir\nbag and one-way\nvalve. [227]\n10 to 15 liters per\nminute. [230]\nReservoir bag must be\nfull before use, adjust\nflow to prevent\ncollapse. [230]\nNasal\nCannula\nSmall tube prongs\nthat fit into nostrils.\n[233]\n1 to 6 liters per\nminute (24-44%\nO2). [234]\nFlow rates above 6\nL/min not\nrecommended for\ncomfort. [235]\nPartial Rebreathing\nMask\nSimilar to nonrebreather,\nbut\npatient re-breathes\na small amount of\nair. [238]\nOne-way valve\nbetween mask and\nreservoir is absent.\n[238]\nVenturi Mask Has attachments to\nvary oxygen\npercentage with\nconstant flow. [240]\nMedium flow\ndelivers 24-40%\nO2. [240]\nPercentage varies by\nmanufacturer. [240]\nTrach Mask Covers the\ntracheostomy hole.\n[242]\nUsed for patients with\ntracheostomies. [241]\nCommon oxygen delivery equipment in the field includes non-rebreathing\nmasks, bag valve devices, and nasal cannulas. [225]\nThe one-way valve on a non-rebreathing mask prevents rebreathing exhaled\ngases. [229]\nA nasal cannula is used for patients with mild hypoxia. [235]\nIt is less effective if the patient breathes through their mouth or has a\nnasal obstruction. [236]\nHumidified oxygen may be associated with increased generation of air sliced\ndroplets. [237]\nFor patients with tracheostomies, a trach mask covers the opening. [241]\nIf a trach mask is unavailable, improvise by placing a face mask over the\nstoma. [243]\n11. Assisted or Artificial Ventilation\nBasic airway and ventilation techniques are effective with appropriate oxygen.\n[246]\nSigns and symptoms of inadequate ventilation include altered mental status,\ninadequate minute volume, and excessive accessory muscle use. [247]\nWhen ventilation is inadequate, you need to assist ventilations. [248]\nThis is done with a bag valve mask (BVM). [248]\nIf the patient is conscious, explain the procedure. [249]\nPlace the mask over the mouth and nose and squeeze the bag with each\nbreath, maintaining the same rate. [250]\nAdjust the rate and tidal volume after initial breaths to maintain adequate\nminute volume. [252]\nIf the patient is not breathing, begin artificial ventilation immediately. [254]\nMethods include mouth-to-mask or one- or two-person BVM. [255]\nArtificial ventilations are not the same as normal breathing. [256]\nNormal breathing creates negative pressure, sucking air in. [257]\nPositive pressure ventilation forces air into the chest cavity. [257]\nPositive pressure increases intrathoracic pressure, potentially reducing\nblood return to the heart. [258]\nIt can force air into the stomach, causing gastric distension. [261]\nThe EMT must regulate the rate and volume to prevent a drop in cardiac\noutput. [263]\nventilation rates for a patient not breathing but with a pulse: [264]\nAdult: one breath every six seconds. [264]\nChild: one breath every two to three seconds. [264]\nInfant: one breath every two to three seconds. [264]\n12. Bag-Valve Mask (BVM) and Gastric Distension\nThe mouth-to-mask technique uses a barrier device. [268]\nA mask with an oxygen inlet provides oxygen during this. [269]\nA bag valve mask (BVM) is a common device used. [269]\nIt provides less tidal volume than mouth-to-mask but delivers a high\nconcentration of oxygen. [269]\nComponents of BVM devices include: [270]\nDisposable self-inflating mask (with a disablable pop-off valve if present).\n[270]\nInline viral filter. [271]\nOutlet valve that is a true valve for re-breathing. [271]\nOxygen reservoir for high oxygen concentration. [271]\nOne-way or no-jam inlet valve system. [272]\nTransparent face mask. [273]\nAbility to perform under extreme conditions. [273]\nThe volume of air delivered is based on observing chest rise and fall. [274]\nGastric distension occurs when artificial ventilation fills the stomach with air.\n[276]\nIt is likely from ventilating too forcefully or rapidly. [277]\nAir obstruction from a foreign body or improper head position also\ncontributes. [277]\nGive slow, gentle breaths over one second to prevent distension. [278]\nEnsure the patient\u0027s airway is properly positioned. [279]\nVentilate at the appropriate rate and volume. [279]\nIf gastric distension prevents ventilation and ALS is unavailable, consider\npressure over the upper abdomen as a last resort. [280]\nIf vomiting occurs, turn the patient\u0027s entire body to the side. [281]\nSuction or wipe out the mouth, then return to supine and continue\nventilation. [282]\n13. Passive Ventilation and Advanced Ventilation Devices\nPassive ventilation (passive oxygenation or apneic oxygenation) occurs with\nchest compressions. [283]\nCompressing the chest forces air out, and recoil creates negative\npressure, drawing air in. [283]\nIt can be enhanced by inserting an OPA and providing supplemental\noxygen. [284]\nAn automatic transport ventilator (ATV) or resuscitator is an advanced\nventilation device. [285]\nIt allows setting ventilation variables. [286]\nIt frees the EMT to perform other tasks. [286]\nConstant reassessment is necessary. [286]\nContinuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is a non-invasive ventilation\nsupport. [287]\nMany sleep apnea patients use it at night. [289]\nIn the pre-hospital setting, it is useful for respiratory distress from COPD,\npulmonary edema, and bronchospasm. [290]\nIt is becoming a widely used EMT tool. [291]\nCPAP increases pressure in the lungs. [292]\nIt opens collapsed alveoli and pushes oxygen across the membrane. [292]\nIt forces interstitial fluid back into pulmonary circulation. [292]\nTherapy is typically delivered through a face mask with a strapping system.\n[293]\nA good seal with minimal leakage is essential. [294]\nMany CPAP systems use oxygen as the driving force. [295]\nPatients benefit most during exhalation. [296]\nUse caution with patients with potentially low blood pressure. [296]\nCPAP causes a drop in cardiac output. [296]\n14. CPAP: Indications, Contraindications, and Complications\nCategory Descriptions Examples\nIndications Patient must be\nalert and able to\nfollow\ncommands. [298]\nModerate to severe respiratory distress\n(pulmonary edema, COPD), respiratory\ndistress after submersion, rapid breathing\naffecting minute volume, pulse ox less\nthan 90%. [299]\nContraindications Conditions or\nstates where\nCPAP should not\nbe used. [301]\nRespiratory arrest, agonal respirations,\nhypoventilating, cannot speak or follow\ncommands, cannot protect airway,\nhypotensive, pneumothorax, chest trauma,\ntracheostomy, active GI bleeding,\nvomiting, facial trauma, cardiogenic shock,\ncannot sit upright, CPAP system cannot fit,\npatient cannot tolerate mask. [302]\nComponents Parts of a CPAP\nunit. [309]\nGenerator, mask, tubing, bacterial filter,\none-way valve. [309]\nComplications Potential\nnegative\noutcomes from\nCPAP use. [314]\nClaustrophobia and resistance to mask,\nrisk of pneumothorax (hole in the lung),\nlower blood pressure. [314]\nThe CPAP generator creates resistance, creating back pressure in the\nairways. [310]\nThis pushes open smaller airway structures. [310]\nPressure can be adjusted, typically 7 to 10 is acceptable. [311]\nMost CPAP units are powered by oxygen. [313]\nA full cylinder is important when using CPAP. [313]\nIf a patient resists CPAP due to claustrophobia, coach them through the\nprocess. [314]\nIf the patient shows signs of deterioration, remove CPAP and begin positive\npressure ventilation with a BVM and high flow oxygen. [315]\n15. Special Airway Considerations\nStomas and tracheostomy tubes are special considerations. [316]\nPatients with a laryngectomy have a permanent tracheal stoma. [317]\nIf a patient has a tracheostomy tube, ventilate through the tube with a\nBVM. [318]\nUse the standard 15 to 22 mm adapter on the BVM. [319]\nUse 100% oxygen attached to the BVM. [320]\nIf a patient has a stoma but no tube, use an infant or child mask to seal\nover the stoma. [321]\nSeal the patient\u0027s mouth and nose to prevent air leaks during ventilation.\n[321]\nRelease the seal for exhalation. [321]\nIf you cannot ventilate a stoma patient, try suctioning with a French or\nsoft-tipped catheter. [322]\nSeal the stoma while giving mouth-to-mouth ventilation. [322]\nForeign body airway obstruction is a true emergency if it completely blocks\nthe airway. [323]\nThis can result in death if not treated immediately. [325]\nIn adults, it often occurs during a meal. [326]\nIn children, it can occur while eating or playing. [327]\nThe most common airway obstruction in an unconscious patient is the\ntongue. [330]\nOther causes of obstruction not involving foreign bodies include swelling\nfrom infection or allergic reactions. [331]\nAnaphylaxis is an example. [332]\nTrauma can also cause obstruction due to tissue damage. [333]\nRecognizing airway obstruction includes different levels: [334]\nMild airway obstruction: Patient can still exchange air but has respiratory\ndistress. [334]\nMay have noisy breathing or cough forcefully. [335]\nMay hear wheezing between coughs. [336]\nDo not interfere if the patient can breathe, cough forcefully, or talk.\n[337]\nEncourage and continually reassess. [338]\nSevere airway obstruction: Patient cannot breathe or talk. [340]\nMay be clutching their throat (universal distress sign). [341]\nMay be turning cyanotic. [341]\nLittle or no airway movement. [342]\nEmergency care for foreign body obstruction: [345]\nPerform the head tilt chin lift or jaw thrust maneuver. [346]\nSweep the mouth with a gloved finger if large pieces of material are\npresent. [348]\nUse suction if available. [349]\nAbdominal thrusts are effective for conscious patients. [350]\nThey use residual air in the lungs to expel the object. [351]\nContinue thrusts until the object dislodges or the patient becomes\nunconscious. [351]\nFor an unconscious patient with foreign body obstruction: [353]\nReassess for apnea and inability to ventilate. [353]\nBegin chest compressions as in CPR (30 compressions). [354]\nAfter compressions, open the jaw and look for foreign objects. [355]\nRemove visible objects with a gloved finger or suction. [356]\nNever perform a blind sweep. [357]\nAttempt ventilation after removing the object. [358]\nRepeat compressions and ventilations if unable to ventilate. [359]\nDental appliances can cause obstruction. [359]\nManually remove appliances before ventilations. [360]\nLeave well-fitting dentures in place as they aid BVM seal. [361]\nRemove loose dentures if they interfere. [362]\nFacial bleeding can cause airway problems. [363]\nSevere bleeding and swelling can enter the airway. [364]\nControl bleeding with direct pressure and suction. [364]\n16. Assisting with Advanced Life Support Procedures\nThe EMT plays an essential role in assisting with advanced airway\ninterventions. [366]\nThis includes assisting with endotracheal intubation. [367]\nThe first step is pre-oxygenation, often with BVM ventilation. [367]\nUse an OPA or NPA, ensure a proper seal, and use proper rate and volume.\n[368]\nMaintain a high flow nasal cannula during pre-oxygenation and the\nintubation attempt. [370]\nEquipment setup for endotracheal intubation includes: [371]\nPersonal protective equipment (face mask, eye shield). [371]\nSuction unit with rigid or non-rigid catheters. [372]\nLaryngoscope handle and blade. [373]\nMagill forceps. [373]\nET tube with stylet or introducer (gum elastic bougie). [374]\nWater-soluble lubricant. [376]\n10 ml syringe. [376]\nConfirmation device. [376]\nCommercial ET tube securing device. [376]\nAlternate airway management devices (supraglottic, cricothyrotomy kit).\n[377]\nThe B-MAGIC mnemonic helps remember the typical steps: [378]\nB: Bag valve mask preoxygenation. [379]\nE: Evaluate airway difficulties. [380]\nM: Manipulate the patient. [381]\nA: Attempt the first pass intubation. [382]\nG: Use a supraglottic airway if unable to intubate. [383]\nC: Confirm success and correct any issues. [383]\nMonitor for potential complications after intubation. [384]\nSigns include absence or decrease of end tidal co2 or SpO2. [384]\nIncreasing resistance when ventilating. [384]\nImproper positioning or dislodgement of the ET tube. [385]\n17. Review Questions and Answers\nBreathing is controlled by the pons and medulla. [387]\nThese are the respiratory centers in the brain stem. [387]\nThe EMT should assess the patient\u0027s tidal volume by looking for chest rise\nand fall. [388]\ntidal volume is the air volume moved in and out in a single breath. [388]\nIn a healthy individual, breathing is stimulated by increased levels of carbon\ndioxide in the blood. [389]\nRising carbon dioxide levels stimulate the brain stem. [389]\nSigns of adequate breathing in an adult include normal rate, regular pattern,\nand clear lung sounds. Shallow chest rise is not a sign of adequate breathing.\n[390]\nIf a patient vomits during OPA insertion, immediately turn the patient onto\ntheir side. [392]\nAn NPA airway is contraindicated in a patient with severe head injuries or\nfacial injuries, such as a patient who fell and landed on their head. [393]\nIf a patient receiving oxygen via nasal cannula complains of burning in the\nnose, hook it up to humidified oxygen. [394]\nIf an unconscious patient has slow and irregular respirations after a fall, assist\nbagging this patient. [395]\nWhen ventilating an apneic adult with a BVM, squeeze the bag until visible\nchest rise is noted. [398]\nIf an apneic patient\u0027s stomach becomes distended during BVM ventilation,\nreposition the head. [400]\nThis could be because air is entering the esophagus. [401]",

[3]\nAppropriate use can alleviate pain and improve a patient\u0027s condition. [3]\nHowever, unsafe administration can lead to serious consequences, including\ndeath. [3]\nUnderstanding general pharmacology is significant. [2]\nEMTs must identify, describe, and demonstrate the steps for assisting with or\nadministering medications. [2]\n2. Key Medical Definitions in Pharmacology\nTerm Definition Source\nPharmacology The science of drugs, including their\ningredients, preparation, uses, and actions on\nthe body.\n[4]\nMedication A substance used to treat or prevent disease\nor relieve pain.\n[4]\nPharmacodynamics The process by which the medication works\non the body.\n[5]\nPharmacokinetics The actions of the body upon the medication.\n[9]\nAgonist A medication that causes stimulation of\nreceptors.\n[6]\nAntagonist A medication that binds to the receptor or\nblocks other medications or chemicals from\nattaching.\n[6]\nDose The amount of medication given, depending\non patient\u0027s weight, age, or desired action.\n[7]\nAction The therapeutic effect a medication is\nexpected to have on the body.\n[8]\nOnset The time from medication administration until\nclinical effects occur.\n[10]\nDuration The length of time that the clinical effects\npersist.\n[10]\nElimination How medications and chemicals are removed\nfrom the body.\n[10]\nPeak The point or period when the maximum clinical\neffect is achieved.\n[10]\n3. Factors Affecting Medication Action and Contraindications\nHow a medication works depends on its route of administration and shock\nstates. [11]\nindications are the reasons or conditions for giving a medication. [12]\nContraindications are situations where a medication would harm or have no\npositive effect. [12]\nThere are two types of contraindications. [12]\nAbsolute contraindications mean the medication should never be given if\nthe contraindication is present. [13]\nAn example is a complete allergy causing anaphylaxis. [14]\nRelative contraindications are situations where the benefits may\noutweigh the risks. [14]\nAn example might be a medication causing nausea. [15]\n4. Adverse Effects and Medication Names\nadverse effects are any actions of a medication other than the desired ones.\n[16]\nThere are different types of adverse effects. [17]\nUnintended effects are undesirable but pose little risk to the patient. [17]\nUntoward effects are those that can be harmful to the patient. [17]\nMedications have different names. [18]\nThe generic name is a simple, non-proprietary name, not capitalized. [19]\nAn example is ibuprofen. [20]\nThe trade name is a brand name given by the manufacturer and begins\nwith a capital letter. [21]\nOne drug may have multiple trade names, such as Tylenol. [21]\n5. Types of Drugs and Routes of Administration\nPrescription drugs require a physician\u0027s order and are distributed by\npharmacists. [22]\nOver-the-counter (OTC) drugs can be purchased without a prescription. [22]\nOther drug types include recreational drugs (heroin, cocaine), herbal\nremedies, enhanced drugs, vitamin supplements, and alternative\nmedicines. [23]\nAny medicine a patient takes can be pharmacologically active and cause an\neffect. [23]\nEMTs should ask patients about all medications and drugs they are taking. [23]\nRoutes of administration can be categorized as internal or parenteral. [24]\nInternal medications enter through the digestive system, often as pills or\nliquids. [25]\nThey tend to absorb slowly and are not commonly used in emergency\nsettings. [26]\nParenteral medications enter the body by other means, often liquids\nadministered through needles or syringes. [26]\nThey are absorbed more quickly and offer a more predictable response.\n[26]\nabsorption is the process of medications traveling through body tissues into\nthe bloodstream. [27]\nRoute of Administration Description Absorption\nRate\nSource\nPR (Per Rectum) By rectum; easy to\nadminister, reliable\nabsorption.\nNot specified\n[28]\nPO (Oral) By mouth; takes as\nlong as one hour for\nabsorption.\nSlow\n[28]\nIV (Intravenous) Into the vein; fastest\ndelivery.\nFastest\n[28]\nIO (Intraosseous) Into the bone\nmarrow via drilling;\nreaches\nbloodstream.\nNot specified\n[29]\nSC (Subcutaneous) Injection into fatty\ntissue between skin\nand muscle.\nNot specified\n[30]\nIM (Intramuscular) Into the muscle;\nusually absorbed\nquickly.\nQuick\n[32]\nInhalation Breathed into the\nlungs; absorbed into\nbloodstream quickly.\nQuick\n[33]\nSublingual Under the tongue;\nabsorbed into\nbloodstream within\nminutes.\nQuick\n[34]\nTranscutaneous/Transdermal Through the skin\n(e.g., patches);\nlonger lasting effect.\nLonger\nlasting\n[35]\nIntranasal (IN) Aerosolized liquid\ndelivered into the\nnostril via a MAD\ndevice.\nVery quick\nabsorption\n[38]\n6. Medication Forms and Administration Steps\nThe form of the medication often dictates the route of administration. [41]\nManufacturers choose forms for proper route, timing of release, and effects.\n[41]\nCommon medication forms include:\nTablets and capsules: Most medications given by mouth. [42] Capsules\nare gelatin shells; tablets are compressed with other materials. [43]\nSolutions and suspensions: Liquid mixtures. Solutions are liquid mixtures\nthat cannot be easily separated and can be given by almost any route. [44]\nSuspensions are mixtures of particles that separate and must be shaken\nbefore administration. [47]\nMetered-dose inhalers: Liquids or solids broken into fine droplets or\nparticles for inhalation, delivering a set amount each time. [48]\nTopical medications: Lotions, creams, and ointments applied to the skin\nsurface to affect only that area. [49] Examples: hydrocortisone cream,\nNeosporin, calamine lotion. [49]\ntranscutaneous medications: Applied through the skin for a systemic\neffect. [50] EMTs can absorb these if they touch them. [50]\nGels: Semi-liquids administered in capsules or plastic tubes. [51] Oral\nglucose for diabetic emergencies is an example. [51]\nGas: One of the most common is oxygen, delivered via non-rebreather or\nnasal cannula. [52]\nGeneral steps for administering medications:\nAdminister only under medical direction (online or offline). [53]\nFollow the nine rights of medication administration. [53]\n7. The Nine Rights of Medication Administration\nRight Description Source\nRight Patient Ensure the correct patient receives the\nmedication.\n[54]\nRight Medication Verify the proper medication and\nprescription.\n[54]\nRight Indication Verify the proper indication for the\nmedication.\n[54]\nRight Dose Verify the form and dose of the medication.\n[55]\nRight Route Verify the route of the medication.\n[55]\nRight Time Check the expiration date and condition of\nthe medicine.\n[56]\nRight Education Inform the patient about the medication,\nincluding likely adverse effects or unusual\nsensations.\n[57]\nRight to Refuse A patient with decision-making capacity\ncan decline interventions or medication.\n[58]\nRight\nResponse/Evaluation\nMonitor vital signs, mental status,\nperfusion, and respiratory effort; assess for\nanticipated response and adverse effects.\n[58]\nRight Documentation Document your actions and the patient\u0027s\nresponse.\n[60]\n8. Types of Medication Administration by EMTs\nEMTs have increasing responsibility with medications. [62]\nMany departments have strict guidelines on when EMTs can administer\nmedication. [62]\nThere are three ways EMTs may be allowed to administer medication:\nPeer-assisted medication: Administering medication to yourself or your\npartner, such as after exposure to a toxic agent. [63]\nPatient-assisted medication: Assisting the patient with administering\ntheir own medication. [63] Examples include an Epi autoinjector, nitro, or a\nmetered dose inhaler. [63]\nEMT administration of medication: The EMT directly administers the\nmedication to the patient, often when the patient is confused or unable to\nunderstand. [64] Examples include oxygen, oral glucose, and aspirin. [65]\nMedical control, state guidelines, and local protocols determine what EMTs\ncan administer. [66]\n9. Specific Oral Medications Administered by EMTs\nAdministering oral medications involves specific steps. [68]\nTake standard precautions. [69]\nConfirm the medication has not expired. [69]\nObtain medical direction per local protocol. [69]\nConfirm the patient has a patent airway and can swallow or chew. [70]\nMonitor the patient\u0027s condition and document. [71]\nOral Glucose:\nA sugar used by cells for energy, necessary for brain cells. [72]\nCounters effects of hypoglycemia (extremely low glucose). [72]\nEMTs can give glucose only by mouth in gel form. [73]\nNever administer to an unconscious patient or one unable to swallow or\nprotect their airway. [73]\nAspirin:\nReduces fever, pain, and inflammation. [75]\nIn the pre-hospital field, given to inhibit platelet aggregation, useful\nduring a potential heart attack. [75]\nContraindications: hypersensitivity to aspirin, pre-existing liver damage,\nbleeding disorder, or asthma. [76]\nShould not be given to children. [76]\n10. Sublingual Medications: Nitroglycerin\nsublingual administration (under the tongue) has considerations. [77]\nAdvantages: Easy to talk with awake patients and advise them to place\nthe pill; absorption rates are relatively quick. [78]\nDisadvantages: Requires consent and constant airway evaluation; should\nnot be used if the patient is uncooperative or unconscious. [80]\nNitroglycerin (Nitro) is a common sublingual medication used by cardiac\npatients to relieve angina pain. [81]\nIncreases blood flow by relieving spasm and causing arteries to dilate. [82]\nRelaxes veins throughout the body, decreasing blood return to the heart\nand reducing workload. [83]\nWill decrease blood pressure. [83]\nMust check blood pressure before administering. [84]\nObtain orders or follow local protocols. [84]\nCan have fatal interactions with erectile dysfunction medication (Viagra,\nCialis, Levitra) taken within the last 24 hours, as these are also\nvasodilators. [85]\nCan be administered by metered dose spray or tablet. [88]\nTablet: Place under the tongue to dissolve; patient may feel a tingling\nor burning sensation. [89] Store in original glass container with tight\ncap. [90]\nSpray: Deposit medication under the tongue; one spray equals one\ntablet. [91]\nAdministration considerations:\nWait five minutes before repeating the dose and waiting for a\nresponse. [92]\nClosely monitor vital signs, especially blood pressure. [93]\nGive repeated doses per medical control or local protocol. [93]\nAlways wear gloves as the medication can be absorbed by your skin.\n[94]\nReconfirm the medication is still indicated and understand local\nprotocols. [94]\n11. Intramuscular Medications: Epinephrine and Naloxone\nintramuscular (im) administration has considerations. [96]\nAdvantages: Quick and easy access to the circulatory system without a\nvein needle; blood flow to muscles is relatively stable. [97]\nDisadvantages: Requires using a needle and involves some pain. [98]\nEpinephrine (Epi), also known as adrenaline, is an IM medication. [98]\nReleased naturally by adrenal glands during stress. [99]\nControls the body\u0027s fight-or-flight response. [99]\nDilates passages in the lungs, constricts blood vessels, and increases\nheart rate and blood pressure. [100]\nShould only be given for life-threatening allergic reactions. [101]\nOften dispensed via an auto-injector, which delivers a pre-set amount\n(usually 0.3 mg). [101]\nSome services allow EMTs to assist patients in administering their own Epi.\n[102]\nNaloxone (Narcan) is another IM medication used to reverse opiate overdose\neffects. [103]\nCan be administered by family members or caregivers. [103]\nCan also be administered via the intranasal route. [102]\nConsiderations:\nFollow local protocol. [103]\nDetermine if naloxone was given by a bystander. [103]\nEffects may not last as long as opiates, so repeated doses may be\nneeded. [104]\nGiving naloxone to opiate-dependent patients can cause severe\nwithdrawal symptoms, including seizures and cardiac arrest. [105]\nConsider your personal safety. [105]\nIf naloxone is not available, bag valve mask ventilation may be required.\n[110]\n12. Inhaled Medications: Oxygen, MDIs, and Nebulizers\nOxygen is the most commonly administered medication pre-hospital. [111]\nNeeded by all cells, especially in the heart and brain. [112]\nGenerally given via non-rebreather mask (10-15 L/min) or nasal cannula\n(2-6 L/min). [112]\nArtificial ventilations with a BVM (15 L/min) are needed if the patient is not\nbreathing. [113]\nEnsure no open flame, cigarettes, or sparks when administering oxygen.\n[113]\nmetered dose inhalers (MDIs) and nebulizers are used to administer liquid\nmedications as a fine mist. [114]\nMedication is atomized and breathed into the lungs, delivered to the\nalveoli. [115]\nAdvantages: Fast and relatively easy route to access. [115]\nDisadvantages: Patient needs to be cooperative and have controlled\nbreathing; cannot be used for unconscious patients. [116]\nMDIs require coordination, which can be difficult during breathing trouble.\n[118]\nA spacer fits over the MDI, allowing the patient to spray the dose into a\nchamber and then inhale the mist, useful for young children. [119]\nSmall Volume nebulizers (SVNs) are easier to use than MDIs and can be\nmore effective for moderate to severe respiratory distress. [121]\nThey take longer to deliver medication and require an external air or\noxygen source. [122]\nCan be used while the patient is on CPAP, during BVM ventilation, or\nadapted to a non-rebreather mask. [122]\n13. Patient Medications and Implications for EMS Providers\nFinding out what medications a patient is taking is vital. [124]\nMedication history provides clues to the patient\u0027s condition and helps guide\ntreatment. [124]\nIt is useful for determining chronic or underlying conditions when a patient\ncannot provide history. [125]\nAsk about prescription and non-prescription drugs (OTC, herbal, illegal). [126]\nTransport the medications or a list with the patient to the emergency\ndepartment. [125]\nDo not underestimate the importance of a thorough medical history. [127]\nConsider a patient\u0027s medications in the context of the clinical encounter. [128]\nPatient medications can significantly alter the clinical presentation of acute\nmedical problems or injuries. [129]\nExamples: beta-adrenergic blocking agents and calcium channel\nblockers can slow heart rates. [130]\nanti-platelet and anticoagulant medications can cause significant\nbleeding from minor injuries like a head bump. [131]\n14. Medication Errors and Quality Improvement\nA medication error is the inappropriate use of a medication that could lead to\npatient harm. [132]\nTo prevent errors:\nEnsure the environment does not contribute, with sufficient lighting and\norganized equipment. [133]\nLimit distractions as much as possible. [133]\nConsider using a cheat sheet for critical administration steps. [133]\nIf a medication error occurs:\nRapidly provide any appropriate care. [134]\nNotify medical control quickly. [135]\nFollow local protocols. [136]\nDocument the incident thoroughly, accurately, and honestly. [136]\nTalk with your partner, supervisor, or medical director. [137]\nMedication errors are an opportunity to learn and identify areas for quality\nimprovement. [138]\n15.

Definition and Mechanisms of Shock\nShock, also known as hypoperfusion, is defined as inadequate cellular\nperfusion [4].\nAny compromise in perfusion can lead to cellular injury or death [6].\nIn early stages, the body attempts to maintain homeostasis [6].\nThe cardiovascular system has three parts: the pump (heart), the container\n(blood vessels), and the contents (blood) [13].\nThese three parts are also called the perfusion triangle [16].\nIf one or more parts of the perfusion triangle are not working properly, a\npatient can go into shock [17].\nPoor perfusion impairs the transportation of carbon dioxide out of tissues [11].\nThis results in a dangerous buildup of waste products [11].\nThis buildup can cause cellular damage [12].\nShock is a state of collapse and failure of the cardiovascular system leading to\ninadequate circulation [12].\nTo protect vital organs, the body redirects blood flow from areas tolerant of\nlow flow, like the skin and intestines, to vital organs like the heart, brain, and\nlungs [12].\nEarly recognition and treatment of shock signs and symptoms can save lives\n[12].\nShock is life-threatening and requires immediate recognition and treatment\n[12].\nComponent Description\nThe Pump The heart [14]\nThe Container Blood vessels [14]\nThe Contents The blood [14]\nPerfusion Triangle Components\n-------------------- -------------------------------------\nParts Heart, blood vessels, blood [16]\n2. Causes and Types of Shock\nThere are three basic causes of shock [25].\nThese basic causes relate to the perfusion triangle failing [25].\nThe three basic causes are pump failure, poor blood vessel function, and\nlow fluid volume [26].\nDifferent types of shock result from these basic problems [28].\nTypes of shock include cardiogenic and obstructive shock (pump failure) [29]\n.\nobstructive shock is further broken down into tension pneumothorax, cardiac\ntamponade, and pulmonary emboli [29].\ndistributive shock is a type of poor vessel function [30].\nInside of distributive shock are septic, neurogenic, anaphylactic, and\npsychogenic shock [30].\nhypovolemic shock is a type of low fluid volume shock [31].\nhypovolemic shock is broken down into hemorrhagic and non-hemorrhagic\n[31].\nBasic Cause Resulting Shock Types\nPump Failure Cardiogenic, Obstructive [29]\nPoor Vessel\nFunction\nDistributive (Septic, Neurogenic, Anaphylactic,\nPsychogenic) [30]\nLow Fluid Volume Hypovolemic (Hemorrhagic, Non-Hemorrhagic) [31]\n3. Detailed Overview of Pump Failure Shock (Cardiogenic and\nObstructive)\ncardiogenic shock is a pump failure problem [32].\nIt is caused by inadequate function of the heart [32].\nA major effect is the backup of blood into pulmonary vessels [32].\nThis results in pulmonary edema [32].\ncardiogenic shock is often caused by heart failure or a heart attack [32].\nThe heart cannot maintain output to meet the body\u0027s demands [33].\nobstructive shock is also a pump failure problem [36].\nThe heart is unable to work due to a mechanical obstruction [36].\nThis prevents adequate flow of blood from the heart chambers [38].\nThree types of obstructive shock are cardiac tamponade, tension\npneumothorax, and pulmonary emboli [38].\ncardiac tamponade is a collection of fluid between the pericardial sac and\nthe myocardium [38].\nThis fluid prevents the heart from contracting effectively [39].\nIt can be caused by blunt or penetrating trauma causing hemorrhage\naround the heart [41].\nSigns and symptoms are called beck\u0027s triad [42].\nbeck\u0027s triad includes jugular vein distension, muffled heart tones, and\nnarrowing pulse pressures [43].\ntension pneumothorax is caused by air damaging lung tissue [46].\nAir escapes into the chest cavity and the lung collapses [46].\nUntreated, air accumulates and puts pressure on organs including the\nheart [48].\nThis pressure obstructs the heart\u0027s ability to beat [49].\npulmonary emboli are blood clots in the pulmonary circulation [51].\nThey block blood flow through the pulmonary vessels [53].\nA massive pulmonary emboli can prevent blood from being pumped from\nthe right to the left side of the heart [53].\nThis leads to a backup of blood in the right ventricle [53].\nThis can cause catastrophic obstructive shock and complete pump failure\n[53].\n4. Detailed Overview of Poor Vessel Function Shock (Distributive)\ndistributive shock is caused by poor vessel function [55].\nIt results from widespread dilation of small arterioles, venules, or both [58].\nBlood pools in the expanded vascular beds [58].\nTissue perfusion decreases [58].\nThere are different types of distributive shock [58].\nThese include septic, neurogenic, anaphylactic, and psychogenic shock\n[59].\nseptic shock occurs from a severe infection, usually bacteria [60].\nToxins are generated by bacteria or infected tissues [61].\nThere is widespread vessel dilation and plasma loss through vessel walls\n[61].\nDecreased fluid results in shock [61].\nneurogenic shock is usually from a spinal cord injury [62].\nBlood vessel muscles are cut off from nerve impulses [63].\nVessels below the injury dilate widely [64].\nThis increases the size and capacity of the vascular system [64].\nBlood pools, and the body loses the ability to constrict vessels [64].\nanaphylactic shock happens when a person reacts violently to a substance\n[66].\nThis occurs after being sensitized to the substance [68].\nSensitization means becoming sensitive to a substance that didn\u0027t initially\ncause a reaction [68].\nEach exposure tends to produce a more severe reaction [69].\npsychogenic shock is a sudden reaction of the nervous system [71].\nIt causes temporary, generalized vascular dilation [71].\nUsually, the patient has a syncopal episode (fainting) [71].\nLife-threatening causes include irregular heartbeat or brain aneurysm [72].\nNon-lethal events include bad news, fear, or unpleasant sights like blood\n[72].\nType of Distributive\nShock\nCause / Characteristics\nSeptic Shock Severe infection (bacteria), toxins, widespread dilation\n[60]\nNeurogenic Shock Spinal cord injury, vessel dilation below injury [62]\nAnaphylactic Shock Severe allergic reaction after sensitization [66]\nPsychogenic Shock Sudden nervous system reaction, temporary dilation,\nfainting [71]\n5. Detailed Overview of Low Fluid Volume Shock (Hypovolemic)\nhypovolemic shock is a fluid issue [73].\nIt is the result of an inadequate amount of fluid or volume in the circulatory\nsystem [73].\nThis is a problem with the blood itself [73].\nThere are two types: hemorrhagic and non-hemorrhagic hypovolemic shock\n[73].\nhypovolemic shock can occur with conditions like thermal burns [74].\n6. Stages and Recognition of Shock\nThere are different stages of shock [74].\nThese include compensated shock, decompensated shock, and\nirreversible shock [74].\nIn compensated shock, the body can maintain perfusion [74].\nOnce shock has progressed too far, it becomes irreversible [74].\nIt is impossible to assess when a patient has reached the irreversible stage\n[74].\nRecognizing and treating shock very early is important [74].\nTreatment is needed well before the patient becomes decompensated [74].\nBlood pressure is the last measurable factor to change with shock [75].\nWhen a drop in blood pressure is evident, shock is well developed [75].\nThis is especially true for infants and children [76].\nInfants and children can maintain blood pressure until they lose more than\nhalf their blood volume [76].\nBy the time their blood pressure drops, they are close to death [76].\nExpect shock in many emergency medical situations [77].\nExpect shock if a patient has conditions such as multiple fractures, abdominal\nor chest injury, spinal injury, severe infection, a heart attack, or anaphylaxis\n[77].\nStage of Shock Characteristics\nCompensated Body is able to compensate, maintains perfusion [74]\nDecompensated Body can no longer compensate effectively [74]\nIrreversible Shock has progressed too far, no recovery possible [74]\n7. Assessment and General Emergency Care for Shock\nBegin with scene size-up to ensure safety [78].\nDetermine the mechanism of injury or nature of illness [78].\nPerform a primary assessment [79].\nIf shock is suspected, do a rapid exam [79].\nDetermine the level of consciousness (LOC) [79].\nIdentify and treat any life-threatening concerns first [79].\nDetermine the priority of patient transport [80].\nControl massive external hemorrhage; this is the first priority [80].\nUse direct pressure first [123].\nIf direct pressure fails, use a tourniquet [81].\nAssess and treat ABCs (Airway, Breathing, Circulation) after controlling lifethreatening\nbleeding [82].\nEnsure a patent airway [85].\nQuickly assess breathing [86].\nAssess circulatory status for clues of shock [86].\nCheck for distal and central pulses [87].\nDetermine if pulse is fast, slow, weak, strong, or absent [87].\nA rapid pulse suggests compensated shock [88].\nAssess skin color, temperature, and condition [90].\nCheck capillary refill [90].\nIf the patient has signs of hypoperfusion, treat aggressively [84].\nProvide high-flow oxygen [83].\nInitiate rapid transport [84].\nRequest advanced life support (ALS) as necessary for aggressive shock\nmanagement [84].\nConsider spinal immobilization if needed [85].\nMaintain inline stabilization if necessary [100].\nComfort, calm, and reassure the patient [101].\nMaintain the patient in the supine position [101].\nDo not allow patients to eat or drink [102].\nPrevent body heat loss by using blankets [104].\nTreat additional injuries en route [105].\nConsider rendezvous with ALS or aero medical transport if needed [105].\nAccurately record vital signs every five minutes throughout treatment and\ntransport [106].\nAfter managing life threats, take a history, including the chief complaint and a\nSAMPLE history [92].\nPerform secondary assessments, including a physical exam [93].\nRepeat the primary assessment and perform a focused assessment [94].\nAssess the entire body if there is significant illness or injury, a poor general\nimpression, problems in the primary assessment, or an unresponsive medical\npatient [94].\nPerform assessments quickly but thoroughly [95].\nIf a life-threatening problem is found, treat it immediately [96].\nTake vital signs [97].\nReassess the patient\u0027s vital signs, interventions, chief complaint, ABCs, and\nmental status [97].\nDetermine needed interventions based on findings, focusing on supporting\nthe cardiovascular system [98].\nBegin immediate treatment for shock as soon as it is recognized [99].\nFollow local precautions [100].\nMaintain body temperature by placing blankets under and over the patient\n[104].\n8. Specific Emergency Care for Different Types of Shock\nFor cardiogenic shock:\nThese patients often have chest pain and low blood pressure or a weak,\nirregular pulse [107].\nThey may show cyanosis, anxiety, and nausea [108].\nDo not give nitro if they are hypotensive [108].\nPlace them in a position that eases breathing [109].\nGive high-flow O2 [109].\nInitiate prompt transport and request ALS [109].\nFor obstructive shock:\nFor cardiac tamponade:\nPrioritize increasing cardiac output [111].\nGive high-flow oxygen [111].\nSurgery is the only definitive treatment [111].\nFor tension pneumothorax:\nGive high-flow O2 via a non-rebreather to prevent hypoxia [111].\nChest decompression is required but is an ALS skill [112].\nRequest ALS assistance early but do not delay transport waiting for\nthem [112].\nFor septic shock:\nThis requires hospital management, including antibiotics [113].\nUse standard precautions [113].\nTransport promptly [113].\nGive high-flow O2 and possibly support ventilations with a BVM [114].\nPreserve body heat [114].\nNotify a specialized sepsis team if available [114].\nObtain and maintain a proper airway and assist breathing [115].\nEnsure effective circulation [116].\nTransport to a facility capable of managing neurogenic shock [117].\nFor anaphylactic shock:\nAdminister Epi intramuscularly (IM) as the most effective treatment [118].\nRequires immediate transport [119].\nGive high-flow O2 and possibly assistance with a BVM [119].\nFind out the cause of the reaction and how it was received [119].\nBe aware that a mild reaction can worsen suddenly [119].\nDue to potential airway compromise, request ALS backup as soon as\npossible [119].\nFor psychogenic shock:\nIn uncomplicated fainting, circulation to the brain is restored when the\npatient becomes supine [120].\npsychogenic shock can worsen other types of shock [121].\nIf a patient fell from psychogenic shock, check for injuries, especially in\nolder patients [121].\nIf a patient cannot walk after falling, suspect another problem like a head\nor hip injury [122].\nTransport promptly; all patients with loss of consciousness need\nevaluation at the emergency department [122].\nFor hypovolemic shock:\nStop obvious external bleeding first [123].\nDirect pressure is the best initial method [123].\nIf direct pressure doesn\u0027t work, use a tourniquet [123].\nHandle the patient gently and keep them warm [123].\nRecognize internal bleeding and provide aggressive general support [123].\nSecure and maintain an airway and provide respiratory support, including\noxygen and ventilations [123].\nTransport rapidly to the emergency department [124].\nType of Shock Specific Treatment\nCardiogenic Position for breathing, high-flow O2, prompt transport, ALS\nrendezvous [109]\nCardiac\nTamponade\nHigh-flow O2, prompt transport (needs surgery) [111]\nTension\nPneumo\nHigh-flow O2 via non-rebreather, ALS for chest decompression,\nprompt transport [111]\nSeptic Standard precautions, high-flow O2, BVM support, preserve\nbody heat, prompt transport (needs hospital management) [113]\nAnaphylactic Administer Epi IM, immediate transport, high-flow O2, BVM\nsupport, ALS backup [118]\nPsychogenic Check for injuries, prompt transport for all patients with loss of\nconsciousness [121]\nHypovolemic Control external bleeding (direct pressure, tourniquet), secure\nairway, respiratory support, keep warm, rapid transport [123]\n9. Considerations for Pediatric and Geriatric Patients in Shock\nTreating shock in older patients is no different than treating any other shock\npatient [125].\nOlder patients generally have more serious complications than younger\npatients [125].\nMany older patients take numerous medications [125].\nThese medications can mask or mimic signs of shock [125].\nBlood pressure changes are a late indicator of shock, particularly in infants\nand children [76].\nInfants and children can maintain their pressure until they lose more than half\ntheir blood volume [76].\nBy the time pressure drops in infants and children, they are close to death [76].\nProvide inline spinal stabilization if indicated [126].\nIf spinal stabilization is not indicated, maintain the patient in a position of\ncomfort [126].\nControl life-threatening hemorrhages immediately with direct pressure [126].\nSuction as necessary [126].\nProvide high-flow oxygen via a non-rebreather mask [126].\nMaintain body temperature [127].\nProvide rapid transport for all patients in shock, including older and younger\npatients [127].",

Airway Management in BLS A\n4. Managing Foreign Body Airway Obstruction A\n5. Special Considerations and When to Stop BLS A\n6. Importance of Training and Support A\n1. Introduction to Basic Life Support (BLS)\nBasic Life Support (BLS) is non-invasive emergency life-saving care used to treat\nmedical conditions like airway obstructions, respiratory arrest, and cardiac arrest [6].\nThe principles of BLS were introduced in 1960, and techniques have been regularly\nreviewed and revised [4].\nBLS focuses on the ABCs: Airway, Breathing, and Circulation [8].\nFor patients in cardiac arrest, the CAB sequence (Compressions, Airway,\nBreathing) is used because chest compressions are essential and must start\nquickly [9].\nOnly seconds should pass between recognizing the need for treatment and\nstarting bls [9].\nTime is critical for patients who are not breathing; permanent brain damage is\npossible if the brain is without oxygen for more than four to six minutes [10].\nBLS differs from Advanced Life Support (ALS), which includes advanced\nprocedures like cardiac monitoring and administering medications [19].\nWhen done correctly, BLS can maintain life temporarily until ALS measures can\nbegin [20].\nThe American Heart Association Chain of Survival includes six links that must all be\nfollowed [21].\nThese links are recognition and activation of the emergency response system,\nimmediate high-quality CPR, rapid defibrillation, basic and advanced emergency\nservices, advanced life support, post-arrest care, and recovery [23].\nIf any link is missing, the patient is more likely to die [25].\nFeature Basic Life Support (BLS) Advanced Life Support (ALS)\nNature Non-invasive emergency\nlife-saving care\nAdvanced procedures\nProcedures CPR, defibrillation, airway\nmanagement\nCardiac monitoring, IV fluids/medications,\nadvanced airway adjuncts\nGoal Treat conditions like\narrest/obstruction\nMaintain life until ALS measures can be\nstarted\nTime\nMaintained\nShort time Initiated after BLS\n2. Core Components of BLS: CPR and Defibrillation\nCardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) re-establishes circulation and artificial\nventilation in a patient who is not breathing and has no pulse [14].\nThe steps of CPR involve restoring circulation through high-quality chest\ncompressions and restoring breathing by opening the airway and providing rescue\nbreathing [15].\nAdminister two breaths over one second, visualizing for chest rise and fall [17].\nChest compressions involve applying rhythmic pressure and relaxation to the lower\nhalf of the sternum [49].\nCompression squeezes the heart to circulate blood [49].\nAvoid leaning on the chest between compressions to allow for complete recoil\n[49].\nInjuries can be minimized with proper technique and hand placement [50].\nCompression and relaxation should be rhythmic and of equal duration, a one-toone\nratio [53].\nThe sternum must return to its normal resting position between compressions\n[54].\nAn automated external defibrillator (AED) is a vital link in the chain of survival and\nshould be applied to a cardiac arrest patient as soon as possible [34].\nIf cardiac arrest is witnessed, begin CPR and then apply the AED immediately\n[36].\naed use in children differs: apply after the first five cycles of CPR (about two\nminutes) [37].\nUse pediatric-sized pads and a dose attenuating system [38].\nIf pediatric pads or attenuator are unavailable, use adult-sized pads with an\nanterior-posterior placement [39].\nFor patients with pacemakers or implanted defibrillators, place AED electrodes at\nleast one inch away from the device [40].\nIf the patient is wet or in water, pull them out and dry the skin before attaching AED\npads [41].\nIf in a small puddle or snow, the aed can be used, but the chest should be dried\n[42].\nRemove transdermal medication patches and wipe the skin before attaching AED\npads [42].\nFor CPR to be effective, the patient must be supine on a firm, flat surface [43].\nEnsure enough space for two rescuers [44].\nIf possible, log roll the patient onto a long backboard [45].\nQuickly check for breathing and a pulse simultaneously, taking no longer than 10\nseconds [46].\nVisualize the chest for signs of breathing and palpate for a carotid pulse [48].\nOne-rescuer adult CPR involves a continuous cycle of 30 compressions followed by\ntwo ventilations [67].\nTwo-rescuer adult CPR is preferred [69].\nRescuers can switch positions every two minutes to facilitate effective\ncompressions [70].\nBasic principles of bls are the same for infants, children, and adults, but the causes\nof arrest differ [30].\nCardiac arrest in adults usually follows respiratory arrest, while in infants and\nchildren, respiratory arrest typically causes cardiac arrest [31].\nAirway and breathing are the focus of pediatric BLS [80].\nFor effective chest compressions, the infant or child must be on a hard, flat surface\n[86].\nUse two fingers to compress an infant\u0027s chest [86].\nIf two rescuers are present for an infant, use the two-thumb encircling technique\n[86].\nIn children older than eight years old, the heel of one or both hands can be used\n[87].\nIf a child is not breathing but has a pulse, open the airway and deliver one breath\nevery two to three seconds (about 12 to 20 breaths a minute) [91].\nIf a child is not breathing and has no pulse, provide rescue breathing after every 30\ncompressions, or 15 compressions if two rescuers are present [92].\nMaintain a chest compression fraction greater than 80%, meaning compressions\nshould be performed for at least 80% of the total resuscitation time [100].\nAge Group Compression\nto Ventilation\nRatio (1\nRescuer)\nCompression\nto Ventilation\nRatio (2\nRescuers)\nHand\nPlacement\nCompression\nTechnique\nDepth\nAdult 30:2 [68] 30:2 [68] Lower half\nof sternum\n[49]\nHeel of one\nor both hands\nAt least 2\ninches\nChild (1\nyr+)\n30:2 [92] 15:2 [92] Heel of one\nor both\nhands\n(older\nchildren)\n[87]\nHeel of one\nor both hands\nAbout 2\ninches\nInfant 30:2 [92] 15:2 [92] Lower half\nof sternum\n[86]\nTwo fingers\n[86]\nAbout 1.5\ninches\nInfant Lower half\nof sternum\n(tworescuer)\n[86]\nTwo thumbs\nencircling [86]\nAbout 1.5\ninches\n3. Airway Management in BLS\nOpening the airway is the next step in BLS after starting cpr and applying an AED.\nIn non-traumatic adult patients, open the airway using a head tilt-chin lift maneuver\n[57].\nIf trauma is suspected, use the jaw thrust maneuver [57].\nRemove any foreign materials found in the mouth [57].\nIf the patient is breathing adequately and has no signs of head, spine, hip, or pelvis\ninjury, place them in the recovery position [58].\nThe recovery position maintains an open airway in an adequately breathing\npatient with a decreased level of consciousness who has no spinal injury [58].\nLack of oxygen (hypoxia) combined with too much carbon dioxide (hypercarbia) is\nlethal [59].\nIf the patient is not breathing, provide deliberate ventilations lasting for one second\n[59].\nVentilations can be given by one or two EMS providers [60].\nUse a barrier device such as a pocket mask with a one-way valve or a bag-valve\nmask [61].\nThese devices are used to supply supplemental oxygen when possible [61].\nArtificial ventilations may cause gastric distension (stomach filling with air), which\ncan lead to vomiting [64].\nBe ready with a suction unit in case the patient vomits [64].\nFor patients with a stoma (a surgical opening connecting the trachea to the skin),\nplace the bag mask or pocket mask device directly over the stoma to ventilate [63].\nA face mask with a one-way valve or barrier device over the tracheostomy site\ncan also be used [94].\nIn a child with a trach tube, remove the mask from the bag and connect it\ndirectly to the tube [93].\n4. Managing Foreign Body Airway Obstruction\nRecognize foreign body airway obstructions, remembering the most common cause\nin unresponsive patients is the relaxation of throat muscles, particularly the tongue\n[109].\nOther causes include vomited contents, blood, damaged tissue, dentures, food, or\nsmall objects [110].\nIn adults, airway obstruction usually occurs during a meal, while in children, it can\nhappen during a meal or at play [111].\nWith a mild airway obstruction, the patient can exchange an adequate amount of air\nbut shows signs of respiratory distress [112].\nLeave patients with mild obstruction alone and observe for signs of severe\nobstruction, continuing to reassess [113].\nA sudden severe obstruction is usually easy to recognize in responsive patients [115].\nThe patient suddenly cannot speak or cough, may grasp their throat, turn\ncyanotic, and make exaggerated breathing efforts; stridor might also be present\n[116].\nIn unresponsive patients, suspect airway obstruction if maneuvers to open the\nairway and ventilate are ineffective [117].\nTo remove a foreign airway obstruction in adults and children older than one year,\nuse the abdominal thrust maneuver (Heimlich maneuver) [118].\nThis maneuver creates an artificial cough [119].\nIf a patient with a severe airway obstruction becomes unresponsive, perform chest\ncompressions [120].\nInstead of abdominal thrusts, use chest thrusts for women in advanced stages of\npregnancy and obese patients [123].\nIf a responsive patient becomes unresponsive due to airway obstruction, lower\nthem to the ground, call for help, and start 30 chest compressions [127].\nDo not check for a pulse before starting compressions [128].\nOpen the airway and look in the mouth; if a visible object can be easily removed,\nremove it with a finger [129].\nIf no object is seen, continue chest compressions [130].\nRepeat the sequence until the obstruction is relieved or als takes over [131].\nIn unresponsive patients, after checking for breathing and a pulse, if a pulse is\npresent but breathing is absent, open the airway and attempt to ventilate [132].\nIf the first ventilation doesn\u0027t cause chest rise, reposition the airway and attempt\nagain [134].\nIf both attempts fail, perform 30 compressions, open the airway, look for and\ncarefully remove any visible object, then attempt to ventilate again [135].\nIn children with signs of airway obstruction, do not waste time trying to dislodge the\nobject if they can still breathe, cough, or talk; administer supplemental oxygen if\nneeded and transport immediately [136].\nIf they can breathe, cough, or talk, do not interfere [138].\nFor a responsive, standing, or sitting child, perform the heimlich maneuver with less\nforce than on an adult [140].\nAn unresponsive child older than one year with airway obstruction is managed like\nan adult [141].\nFor responsive infants, perform back slaps and chest thrusts (compressions) [143].\nHold the infant face down on your forearm with the head lower than the body\n[144].\nGive five back blows between the shoulder blades with the heel of your hand\n[146].\nRoll the infant over and give five quick chest thrusts with two fingers on the\nlower half of the sternum [146].\nIn unresponsive infants, begin chest compressions immediately; do not check for a\npulse [148].\nOpen the airway and look in the mouth; if a visible object can be easily removed,\nremove it [150].\nIf no object is seen, resume chest compressions [152].\nContinue the sequence of compressions, opening the airway, and looking in the\nmouth until the obstruction is relieved or als takes over [153].\nAge/Situation Responsive Patient Unresponsive Patient\nAdult/Child (\u003e1 yr) Heimlich maneuver\n(abdominal thrusts) [118]\nChest compressions [120]\nPregnant/Obese\nAdult\nChest thrusts [123] Chest compressions (after\nbecoming unresponsive) [127]\nChild (signs of\nobstruction)\nObserve, transport if\nneeded, supplement oxygen\nif tolerated [136]\nChest compressions (managed like\nadult if \u003e1 yr) [141], open airway,\nlook, remove [150]\nInfant Back slaps and chest\nthrusts [143]\nChest compressions [148], open\nairway, look, remove [150]\n5. Special Considerations and When to Stop BLS\nThere are special circumstances to consider during bls [154].\nFor opiate overdoses, EMTs may administer narcan to reverse the arrest [155].\nIn cardiac arrest during pregnancy, the priority is high-quality cpr [155].\nIf the uterus is felt at or above the umbilicus, perform manual displacement of\nthe uterus to the patient\u0027s left to relieve compression on the great vessels\nwhile doing cpr [155].\nIf not in cardiac arrest, position the pregnant patient on her left side [155].\nThere are three general rules for when not to start cpr [102].\nIf the scene is unsafe [102].\nIf the patient has obvious signs of death along with absence of pulse and\nbreathing [102].\nObvious signs of death include rigor mortis (stiffening), dependent\nlividity/liver mortis (purple discoloration), putrefaction (decomposition), or\nevidence of a non-survivable injury [103].\nIf the patient and physician have previously agreed on Do Not Resuscitate (DNR)\norders [106].\nOnce cpr begins, continue until one of the following events occurs, using the STOP\nmnemonic [106].\nMnemonic Meaning Explanation\nS Patient starts breathing and has a\npulse [106]\nIndicates a return of spontaneous\ncirculation.\nT Patient is transferred to another\nprovider of equal or higher training\n[107]\nHanding over care to qualified\npersonnel.\nO You are out of strength [107] Physically unable to continue CPR,\nnot just tired.\nP Physician directs you to discontinue\n[107]\nMedical command provides an\norder to stop resuscitation efforts.\n6. Importance of Training and Support\nOngoing education and training are crucial for EMTs [164].\ncpr skills can deteriorate over time [164].\nPractice often using mannequin-based training [164].\ncpr self-instruction through video or computer-based modules with hands-on\npractice can be an alternative to instructor-led courses [165].\nEducation and training for the public are also very important [166].\nEMTs are patient advocates responsible for facilitating training of lay people in\ncpr and aed operation [166].\nIf asked to train community members in hands-only cpr, consider it a\nprofessional responsibility [167].\nGrief support for family members and loved ones is a significant aspect of care [156].\nFamily members may experience a psychological crisis [156].\nThey will remember the event in detail for the rest of their lives [157].\nAppropriate and supportive care at the onset of grief can positively affect their\ngrieving process [157].\nKeep the family informed throughout the resuscitation process [158].\nDesignate one provider to communicate the patient\u0027s status clearly and\nconcisely [158].\nAfter resuscitation has stopped, helpful measures include taking the family to a\nquiet, private place, introducing yourself, using clear language, and speaking in a\nwarm, sensitive, and caring manner [159].\nExhibit calm, reassuring authority, use the patient\u0027s name, and use eye contact\nand appropriate touch [160].\nAccept that family members will show emotion; be supportive but do not hover\n[161].\nAsk if a friend or family member can be called for support [162].\nWhen leaving, turn the family member over to someone and ensure children are\nnot ignored [163].",

Introduction to Medical Emergencies\nmedical emergencies involve illnesses caused by disease [6]. They are different from\ntrauma emergencies, which result from physical forces [5].

Patient Assessment in Medical Emergencies\nAssessing a medical patient focuses on the nature of illness and chief complaint [19].\nEstablishing an accurate medical history is crucial [20]. Use dispatch information to guide\nyour response [21]. Avoid tunnel vision, focusing only on one aspect [22]. Maintain a\nprofessional and calm demeanor [23]. Do not label patients or show biases [24].\nRemember a frequent caller may have a different complaint this time [25].\nThe scene size-up ensures safety for you, your crew, and the patient [26]. Use standard\nprecautions [27]. Determine the number of patients and if more help is needed [27].\nDetermine the nature of the illness [28]. Be aware of potentially serious underlying\nconditions (index of suspicion) [28]. Initiate spinal immobilization if necessary [28].\nThe primary assessment includes forming a general impression [29]. Perform a rapid\nexam to find life threats [29]. Determine the patient\u0027s level of consciousness using AVPU\n[29]. Assess airway, breathing, and circulation (ABC) [29].\nFor conscious patients, ensure an open airway and adequate breathing [30].\nCheck respiratory rate, depth, and quality [30].\nConsider oxygen if breathing is affected [30].\nCheck the radial pulse [33].\nObserve skin color, type, and condition [33].\nFor unconscious patients, open the airway using the proper technique [31].\nEvaluate breathing for several seconds [31].\nApply oxygen, especially with shock, difficulty breathing, or low SpO2 (\u003c94%)\n[32].\nMay need airway adjuncts and ventilatory assistance with a bag valve mask\n[32].\nCheck circulation at the carotid artery [34].\nMake a transport decision based on the patient\u0027s condition [34].\nHistory taking helps determine the problem or its cause [38]. Gather a thorough history\n[39]. Investigate the chief complaint using opqrst (onset, provocation, quality, radiation,\nseverity, time) [41]. For unconscious patients, survey the scene for medications and\nmedical devices [40]. Obtain patient history using SAMPLE (allergies, medications, past\nhistory, last oral intake, events) [41]. Record all allergies and medications [41]. Take\nmedications with you to the hospital [41].\nThe secondary assessment may happen on scene or en route [42]. Sometimes there is\nno time for a secondary assessment [43]. Conscious patients get a limited or detailed\nphysical exam based on the chief complaint [44]. Unconscious patients always get a\nhead-to-toe exam to find clues [45]. A full body assessment should be quick to avoid\ndelaying transport [46]. Examine the head, neck, chest, abdomen, extremities, and back\n[46].\nTreatment depends on findings and local protocols [47]. Take vital signs: pulse rate,\nrhythm, and quality [48]. Assess respirations rate, quality, and regularity [49]. Obtain an\ninitial blood pressure [50]. Measure systolic and diastolic pressures [51]. Consider using an\nautomatic blood pressure cuff [51]. Obtain blood glucose levels and pulse oximetry [52].\n3. Reassessment and Transport Decisions\nReassessment starts after initial assessment and treatment [53]. It continues throughout\ntransport [53]. Repeat the primary assessment [54]. Reassess the chief complaint [54].\nConsider the need for advanced life support [55]. Repeat the physical exam to find and\ntreat changes [56]. Obtain vital signs every 5 minutes for unstable patients [58]. Obtain\nvital signs every 15 minutes for stable patients [58]. Review all performed treatments [59].\nDocument any changes from treatments [59]. Adjust treatments as needed [59].\nMost emergencies need hospital treatment beyond pre-hospital care [60]. The hospital\noffers advanced testing [61]. Administering medicine may be beyond the EMT\u0027s scope [61]\n. EMTs need direct permission from medical control to give medicine [62]. EMTs can use\nan AED on pulseless and apneic patients [63].\nScene time may be longer for medical patients [65]. This allows gathering more\ninformation for the emergency department [65]. Critical patients need rapid transport [66].\nCriteria for Rapid Transport\nUnconscious or altered mental status [36]\nAirway or breathing problems [36]\nObvious circulation problems (bleeding, shock) [36]\nVery old or very young patients [66]\nLife-threatening conditions require transport with lights and sirens [67]. Non-critical\npatients may use non-emergency transport [68]. Transport modes are ground or air [68].\nGround units have EMTs and paramedics [69]. Air units have critical care transport\nprofessionals and paramedics [70]. Generally, transport to the closest hospital [71].\nSometimes another hospital is better for the patient\u0027s specific condition [72].\n4. Infectious Diseases in Emergency Care\nApproach patients with infectious diseases like other medical patients [73]. Perform\nscene size-up and standard precautions [73]. Complete the primary assessment [73].\nGather patient history using opqrst for the chief complaint [74]. Obtain sample history\nand baseline vital signs [75]. Pay attention to medicines and events leading up to the\nproblem [76]. Ask about recent travel or contact with travelers [77].\nGeneral management focuses on life-threatening conditions from the primary\nassessment [78]. Be empathetic [79]. Position the patient for comfort on the stretcher [80].\nKeep the patient warm [80]. Always use standard precautions [80]. Follow agency\nexposure control plans [81]. Clean equipment properly [81]. Discard disposable supplies\nand wash linens [81].\nInfectious\nDisease\nCharacteristics Transmission PPE\nRecommendations\nInfluenza\n[84]\nSusceptible: chronic conditions,\ncompromised immune systems,\nvery young/old [84]\nDirect contact\nwith nasal\nsecretions,\nGloves, eye\nprotection,\nHEPA/N95 mask\n[85]\nairborne\ndroplets [84]\nHerpes\nSimplex [88]\nTiny fluid blisters on\nlips/genitals [89].

Treatment may not be straightforward [139]. Delays in\ndiagnosis can be harmful [140]. Stay calm and use patient assessment skills [140]. Treat\nthe patient\u0027s symptoms [140]. Report to medical control [140]. Transport the patient safely\nto the emergency department [140]. Be prepared for patients with both medical and\ntrauma conditions [141].",

Introduction to Respiratory Emergencies and Anatomy\nRespiratory emergencies are significant in all age groups, including infants,\nchildren, and adults [2].\nEMTs frequently encounter patients experiencing dyspnea, which means\ndifficulty breathing [5].\nThe cause of dyspnea can be challenging to identify, but timely care can still\nbe life-saving [5].\nUnderstanding the respiratory system\u0027s anatomy is crucial for managing these\nemergencies [6].\nThe respiratory system includes the diaphragm, chest wall muscles,\naccessory muscles, and nerves from the brain and spinal cord [7].\nThe upper airway consists of structures above the larynx, such as the nose,\nmouth, jaw, oral cavity, pharynx, and larynx [8].\nThe larynx serves as the division point between the upper and lower airways\n[8].\n2. Physiology of Respiration and Pathophysiology of Impaired\nBreathing\nThe main function of the lungs is respiration, the exchange of oxygen and\ncarbon dioxide [10].\nAir travels through the trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, and finally to the alveoli\nwhere gas exchange happens [11].\nRespiration involves two processes: inspiration and expiration [12].\nOxygen enters the blood, and carbon dioxide is removed [13].\nIn healthy lungs, this exchange occurs rapidly at the alveoli through diffusion\n[13].\nThe brain stem monitors carbon dioxide levels in the blood [16].\nHigh carbon dioxide levels lead to faster, deeper breathing, while low levels\nslow breathing down [17].\nGas exchange can be hindered by airway abnormalities, disease, trauma, or\nissues with pulmonary vessels [19].\nProcess Description Gas Exchange\nInspiration Oxygen is provided to the\nblood\nOccurs rapidly at the alveoli\nthrough diffusion\nExpiration Carbon dioxide is removed\nfrom the body\nCarbon dioxide returns to the lungs\nand is exhaled\n3. Carbon Dioxide Retention and Hypoxic Drive\nSome patients have consistently high levels of carbon dioxide in their blood\n[20].\nOver time, this can impair the respiratory center in the brain [20].\nThis is often seen in patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease\n(COPD) [20].\nTheir ability to exhale carbon dioxide is hindered [21].\nThe brain adapts to these high levels [22].\nIt switches to a backup system based on low oxygen levels to control\nbreathing [22].\nThis backup system is called hypoxic drive [22].\nCaution is advised when giving oxygen to these patients [22].\n4. Causes and Signs of Dyspnea\nDyspnea can result from many different conditions [23].\nAltered mental status can indicate the brain is hypoxic (low oxygen) [23].\nMedical conditions causing difficulty breathing include pulmonary edema, hay\nfever, pleural effusion, airway obstruction, hyperventilation syndrome,\nenvironmental or industrial exposures, carbon monoxide poisoning, or drug\noverdose [23].\nSituations leading to dyspnea can involve breathing too fast, obstructed gas\nexchange by fluid, infection, or collapsed alveoli, damaged alveoli, obstructed\nair passages by spasm, mucus, or weakness, obstructed blood flow to lungs\nby a blood clot, or a pleural space filled with air or fluid [24].\nTable 16-2 in the book shows signs and symptoms of inadequate breathing\n[25].\nDyspnea is common in patients with cardiopulmonary diseases [26].\nCongestive heart failure (CHF) causes the heart to pump poorly, leading to\noxygen deprivation [26].\nSevere pain can also cause rapid, shallow breathing without primary lung\nissues [26].\nCondition Description / Effect on Breathing\nPulmonary Edema Fluid in the lungs [23]\nHay Fever Allergic reaction causing cold-like symptoms [23]\nPleural Effusion Collection of fluid around the lungs [23]\nObstruction of the Airway Mechanical blockage [23]\nHyperventilation Syndrome Over breathing leading to low carbon dioxide levels\n[23]\nEnvironmental/Industrial\nExposures\nInhaling harmful substances [23]\nCarbon Monoxide Poisoning Inhaling odorless, poisonous gas [23]\nDrug Overdose Can cause hypoxia or dyspnea [23]\nCongestive Heart Failure\n(CHF)\nHeart pumps ineffectively, depriving the body of\noxygen [26]\nSevere Pain Can cause rapid, shallow breathing without primary\npulmonary dysfunction [26]\nObstruction of Gas\nExchange\nBy fluid, infection, collapsed alveoli, damaged\nalveoli, mucus, spasm, blood clot, or pleural air/fluid\n[24]\nBreathing Too Fast Can be a sign of dyspnea [24]\n5. Upper and Lower Airway Infections\nInfectious diseases can cause dyspnea by affecting various parts of the\nairway [29].\nInadequate oxygen delivery to tissues is often due to some form of\nobstruction [31].\nInfectious obstructions can include mucus and secretions in major passages\n(like colds or diphtheria), or swelling of soft tissues in the upper airway (like\nepiglottitis or croup) [32].\nStridor is a sound produced by upper airway infections, often described as a\nseal bark [36].\nImpaired oxygen exchange in the alveoli (lower airway) is seen in pneumonia\n[36].\nUsing protective equipment (PPE) is important when in contact with patients\nwith infectious diseases [37].\nCroup is typically seen in children aged 6 months to 3 years, causing\ninflammation and swelling of the pharynx, larynx, and trachea [38]. Hallmarks\nare stridor and a seal bark cough, and it responds well to humidified oxygen\n[41].\nEpiglottitis is inflammation of the epiglottis, usually bacterial and more\ncommon in children, though it can occur in adults [44]. Patients, especially\nchildren, may sit in a tripod position, drool, and should be handled gently with\nhigh-flow oxygen and nothing placed in their mouths [45].\nRSV is a common and highly contagious viral illness in children affecting lungs\nand breathing passages, leading to bronchitis and pneumonia [47]. Assess for\ndehydration and treat airway/breathing problems [49].\nBronchiolitis is a viral illness often caused by RSV, affecting newborns and\ntoddlers, where bronchioles become inflamed, swell, and fill with mucus [50].\nOxygen therapy and frequent reassessment for respiratory distress are\nneeded [51].\nPneumonia is a lung infection, often secondary to an upper respiratory\ninfection that moves downward [52]. Bacterial pneumonia has a quick onset\nwith high fevers, while viral pneumonia is more gradual and less severe [54]. It\nespecially affects chronically or terminally ill people [57]. Fever is a key sign [58]\n. Airway support and supplemental oxygen are important [60].\nPertussis (whooping cough) is an airborne bacterial infection mostly affecting\nchildren under six, characterized by fever and a \"whoop\" sound on inspiration\nafter coughing [62]. It\u0027s highly contagious via droplets, and suctioning may be\nneeded [62].\nInfluenza Type A is an animal respiratory disease that mutated to infect\nhumans, transmitted via direct contact with nasal secretions and aerosolized\ndroplets [62]. Symptoms include high fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches,\nheadache, and fatigue, and it can lead to pneumonia or dehydration [64].\nCOVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) is a coronavirus transmitted through droplets,\nairborne particles, and direct contact [65]. It primarily affects the elderly, those\nin close quarters, and those with weakened immune systems, but young and\nhealthy adults can also be infected [66]. Symptoms include high fever, cough,\ninspirational chest pain, vomiting, diarrhea, and loss of smell, with rapid\nrespiratory deterioration possible [68].\nTuberculosis (TB) is a bacterial infection mainly affecting the lungs but can\nbe in other organs [70]. It can be inactive for years [70]. Symptoms include\nfever, cough, fatigue, night sweats, and weight loss [71]. It\u0027s more prevalent in\nhomeless individuals, prison inmates, nursing home residents, IV drug/alcohol\nabusers, and those with HIV [71]. Minimum PPE includes gloves, eye\nprotection, and an N95 respirator if TB is suspected [72].\n6. Other Respiratory Conditions: Pulmonary Edema and COPD\nPulmonary edema occurs when the left side of the heart cannot pump blood\nfrom the lungs effectively [72]. Fluid backs up in the alveoli and lung tissue [73].\nIt\u0027s usually a result of congestive heart failure (CHF), where the heart muscle\nis too weak to keep up with fluid [74].\nPatients often have dyspnea with rapid, shallow respirations [75].\nSevere cases may show frothy pink sputum from the mouth and nose [76].\nMost patients have a history of chronic CHF, but pulmonary edema can occur\nwithout heart disease [77].\nFluid in the alveoli interferes with oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange [77].\nChronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a lung disease with\nchronic, irreversible airflow obstruction [79].\nIt\u0027s an umbrella term including emphysema and chronic bronchitis [79].\nTobacco smoke often irritates the bronchial tubes, causing chronic bronchitis\n[79].\nChronic bronchitis involves ongoing irritation of the trachea and bronchi with\nconstant excessive mucus production [80]. This mucus obstructs small\nairways and alveoli [80].\nAirways are weakened, and protective lung mechanisms are destroyed [80].\nChronic oxygen problems can lead to right-sided heart failure and fluid\nretention [80].\nPneumonia can easily develop [80].\nRepeated irritation and pneumonia can scar the lungs [81].\nEmphysema is the loss of elasticity in lung material from chronic stretching of\nalveoli [81].\nSmoking directly destroys lung tissue elasticity [81].\nMost COPD patients have elements of both chronic bronchitis and\nemphysema [81].\nCOPD affects the alveoli, making gas exchange difficult [82].\nWet lung sounds (bronchi or crackles/rales) are associated with pulmonary\nedema (fluid) [83].\nDry lung sounds (wheezes) are associated with COPD [85].\nHowever, not all COPD patients will wheeze, and not all CHF patients will have\ncrackles; treat the patient, not just the lung sounds [87].\nLung Sound\nType\nCharacteristics Associated Condition(s)\nWet Lung\nSounds\nBronchi, Crackles,\nRales [83]\nPulmonary Edema [83], Congestive\nHeart Failure [83]\nDry Lung\nSounds\nWheezes [86] COPD [85]\n7. Allergic Reactions Affecting the Airway: Hay Fever, Asthma, and\nAnaphylaxis\nHay fever, asthma, and anaphylaxis are grouped together because they\nresult from allergic reactions (inhaled, ingested, or injected) [87].\nAsthma is an acute spasm of the bronchioles with excessive mucus\nproduction and swelling of the airway lining [88].\nIt affects all ages but is most prevalent in children aged 5-17 [88].\nAsthma produces characteristic wheezing as the patient exhales through\nnarrowed airways [89].\nAcute asthma attacks can be triggered by allergic reactions (food, allergens),\nemotional distress, exercise, or respiratory infection [90].\nIn its most severe form, an allergic reaction can cause anaphylaxis [91].\nHay fever causes cold-like symptoms: runny nose, sneezing, congestion, and\nsinus pressure [92]. Symptoms are from an allergic reaction to outdoor\nairborne allergens like pollen [92].\nAnaphylactic reactions are severe allergic reactions with severe airway\nswelling and widespread blood vessel dilation [93].\nThey may be associated with hives, itching, and signs of shock [93].\nLung sounds can be similar to asthma [93].\nAirway swelling can completely obstruct the airway [93].\nTreatment includes epinephrine, oxygen, and antihistamines [93].\n8. Other Respiratory Conditions: Pneumothorax, Pleural Effusion,\nand Airway Obstruction\nPneumothorax is the partial or total accumulation of air in the pleural space\n[94].\nIt is most often caused by trauma but can also result from medical conditions\n[95].\nA spontaneous pneumothorax occurs suddenly, sometimes in patients with\nchronic lung infections or young people with weak areas in the lungs [96].\nNormally, vacuum-like pressure in the pleural space keeps the lungs inflated\n[96]. When the lung surface is disrupted, air enters the pleural cavity, losing\nthe negative pressure [97].\nPatients with spontaneous pneumothorax become dyspneic and may\ncomplain of pleural or pleuritic chest pain [98].\nBreath sounds are absent or decreased on the affected side [98].\nPneumothorax has the potential to become life-threatening [98].\nPleural effusion is a collection of fluid around the lung [98].\nThis fluid compresses the lung and causes dyspnea [99].\nCauses include irritation, infection, chronic heart failure, or cancer [99].\nBreath sounds are decreased in the area of the effusion [99].\nPatients often feel better sitting upright [99].\nPatients with dyspnea may have a mechanical obstruction of the airway [100]\n.\nIn semi-conscious or unconscious patients, obstruction can be caused by\nvomit, foreign objects, improper head positioning, or the tongue falling back\n[101].\nIf a patient was eating before dyspnea onset, a foreign body airway\nobstruction should be considered [101].\n9. Other Respiratory Conditions: Pulmonary Emboli and\nHyperventilation\nA pulmonary embolus is anything in the circulatory system that travels and\nlodges, obstructing blood flow in the pulmonary area [103].\nCirculation can be partially or completely cut off [103].\nEmboli can be blood clot fragments or foreign bodies like air bubbles [104].\nA pulmonary embolus is a blood clot that travels through the venous system\nand right side of the heart to lodge in the pulmonary artery [105].\nSigns and symptoms include dyspnea, tachycardia (fast heart rate),\ntachypnea (fast breathing), varying hypoxia degrees, cyanosis, and acute\nchest pain [106].\nA large embolus can cause complete obstruction of blood output from the\nright heart, resulting in sudden death [107].\nHyperventilation is breathing excessively to the point that arterial carbon\ndioxide levels fall below normal [107].\nIt can indicate a life-threatening illness, possibly the body compensating for\nacidosis (acid buildup in blood/tissues) [108].\nIt can also result in alkalosis (abnormally low bloodstream volume/basic\nblood) [109].\nSigns and symptoms of hyperventilation syndrome, such as a panic attack,\ninclude anxiety, dizziness, numbness/tingling in hands/feet, and painful\nhand/foot spasms (carpal pedal spasm) [111].\nThe decision of whether hyperventilation is due to a life-threatening illness or\npanic attack should not be made outside the hospital [112].\n10. Environmental/Industrial Exposure and Carbon Monoxide\nPoisoning\nBreathing problems can be caused by environmental or industrial exposures\n[114].\nThis includes inhaling substances like pesticides, cleaning solutions,\nchemicals, and chlorine or other gases accidentally released [114].\nCarbon monoxide (CO) poisoning is caused by an odorless, highly\npoisonous gas [115].\nIt is the leading cause of accidental poisoning deaths in the US [115].\nCO is produced by fuel-burning household appliances and is present in smoke\n[115].\nSymptoms include flu-like complaints and dyspnea [116].\nIt is important not to put yourself at risk in these situations [116].\nHigh flow oxygen via a non-rebreathing mask is the best treatment for\nconscious patients with CO poisoning [116].\n11. Patient Assessment in Respiratory Emergencies\nScene size-up is crucial, always starting with assessing safety [116].\nUsing PPE is important, especially with infectious respiratory diseases and\ntoxic substances [116].\nIf multiple people have dyspnea, consider an airborne hazardous material\nrelease [117].\nDetermine the nature of illness by asking why 9-1-1 was called and\nquestioning the patient, family, or bystanders [118].\nThe primary assessment focuses on identifying immediate life threats [120].\nForm a general impression of the patient\u0027s distress level, noting age and\nposition [120].\nUse the AVPU scale (Alert, Verbal, Painful, Unresponsive) to check\nresponsiveness [120].\nAsk about the chief complaint [120].\nEvaluate the ABC\u0027s: ensure an open and adequate airway, assess breathing\nadequacy, and listen to lung sounds early [121].\nCheck breath sounds on both sides of the chest [122].\nAbnormal sounds include wheezing, rales, rhonchi, or stridor [122].\nFor circulation (C), assess pulse rate, rhythm, and quality, evaluate for shock\nor bleeding, and check perfusion (skin color, temp, condition) [123].\nMake a transport decision (load and go or stay and play) based on whether\nit\u0027s a life threat [125].\nTake a patient history, including history of the illness (investigating the chief\ncomplaint and what the patient has done for the problem) and history of the\npatient [126].\nUse the SAMPLE history (Signs/Symptoms, Allergies, Medications, Past\nMedical History, Last Oral Intake, Events Leading Up) for patients with a\nhistory of respiratory distress or if obtaining from bystanders/family [128].\nUse OPQRST (Onset, Provocation, Quality, Radiation, Severity, Time) to\ngather information about the breathing problem, similar to assessing pain [128]\n.\nPASTE (Progression, Associated chest pain, Sputum, Talking/Tiredness,\nExercise intolerance) is an alternative assessment for shortness of\nbreath/difficulty breathing [128].\nProceed with a secondary assessment only after addressing life threats and\nusing monitoring devices if available [128].\nAssessment Step Key Actions / Focus Areas\nScene Size-Up Ensure safety, use PPE, consider airborne hazards with\nmultiple patients [116]\nNature of Illness Determine why 9-1-1 was activated, question\npatient/family/bystanders [118]\nPrimary\nAssessment\nIdentify immediate life threats, general impression, level of\ndistress, age, position [120]\nResponsiveness Use AVPU scale [120]\nChief Complaint Ask the patient [120]\nAirway (A) Evaluate if open and adequate [121]\nBreathing (B) Assess adequacy, listen to lung sounds (early, both sides)\n[121]\nAbnormal Breath\nSounds\nWheezing, rales, rhonchi, stridor [122]\nCirculation (C) Assess pulse (rate, rhythm, quality), evaluate for\nshock/bleeding, check perfusion (skin color, temp,\ncondition) [123]\nTransport Decision\n(D)\nDetermine if life threat requires rapid transport (load and go)\n[125]\nHistory of Illness Investigate chief complaint, what patient has done for the\nproblem [126]\nHistory of Patient Use SAMPLE for history of respiratory distress,\nbystanders/family can provide info if patient can\u0027t talk [128]\nPresent Illness Use OPQRST or PASTE for information about the breathing\nproblem [128]\nSecondary\nAssessment\nConduct after addressing life threats, use monitoring\ndevices [128]\n12. Differentiating COPD and Congestive Heart Failure\nDifferentiating between COPD and Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) patients is\nimportant [129].\nCOPD patients are usually over 50 years old [130].\nThey often have a history of lung problems [131].\nMost are current or former long-term cigarette smokers [132].\nThey complain of chest tightness and constant fatigue [133].\nTheir chest may have a barrel-like appearance [134].\nThey often use accessory muscles to breathe [135].\nThey exhibit abnormal breath sounds [136].\nThey often exhale through pursed lips [136].\nThey may have digital clubbing, which are abnormally enlarged fingertips\n[136].\nCharacteristic COPD Patients Congestive Heart Failure\n(CHF) Patients\nAge Usually older than 50 [130] Not specified in this document\nsection\nHistory Often have lung problems [131]\n, long-term active or former\ncigarette smokers [132]\nNot specified in this document\nsection, but associated with\npulmonary edema [74]\nComplaints Tightness in chest, constant\nfatigue [133]\nDifficulty breathing, especially\nwhen lying flat [191]\nPhysical\nAppearance\nBarrel-like chest [134], digital\nclubbing (enlarged fingertips)\n[136]\nNot specified in this document\nsection\nBreathing\nPatterns\nOften use accessory muscles\n[135], often exhale through\npursed lips [136]\nRapid, shallow respirations\n(with pulmonary edema) [75]\nBreath Sounds Exhibit abnormal breath\nsounds [136]\nWet lung sounds (bronchi,\ncrackles, rales) often present\nwith pulmonary edema [83]\nOther Switch to hypoxic drive due to\nelevated CO2 levels [22]\nCan experience pulmonary\nedema [73]\n13. Management and Treatment of Respiratory Distress\nRepeat the primary assessment to check for changes in condition [138].\nConfirm that interventions are adequate [138].\nInterventions for respiratory problems include providing high flow oxygen (15\nliters via non-rebreather) [138].\nPositive pressure ventilations may be needed using a bag-valve mask, pocket\nmask, or flow-restricted, oxygen-powered device [138].\nAirway management techniques like oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal airway\ninsertion, suctioning, and positioning may be necessary [138].\nNon-invasive ventilatory support with CPAP might be provided [138].\nPosition the patient in a high Fowler\u0027s position or position of choice [139].\nAssist the patient with respiratory medications [139].\nCommunicate relevant information to the receiving facility staff [140].\nAdminister oxygen immediately for respiratory distress [141].\nProvide ventilatory support if the patient\u0027s mental status is declining, or if\ndistress is moderate/severe, or respiration depth is inadequate [141].\nMonitor the patient\u0027s respiratory status and provide emotional support [141].\nIf the patient has a metered-dose inhaler or small volume nebulizer, call\nmedical control to see if the medication is indicated [141].\nEnsure there are no contraindications for the medication [142].\nMost respiratory inhalation medicines relax muscles around air passages,\ncausing bronchial dilation (airway opening) [142].\nSide effects can include increased pulse, nervousness, and muscle tremors\n[142].\nMedication from an inhaler is delivered to the lungs via the respiratory tract\n[143].\nFollow skill drills for assisting patients with self-administration of inhalers and\nnebulizers [144].\n14. Treatment of Specific Respiratory Conditions\nFor upper or lower airway infections, administer humidified oxygen [145].\nDo not suction or place an OPA in a patient with suspected epiglottitis;\nposition comfortably and transport [146].\nFor pulmonary edema (fluid in lungs), provide 100% oxygen, suction if\nneeded, position comfortably (usually seated), provide CPAP if\nindicated/allowed, and transport promptly [148].\nFor COPD, assist with an inhaler, watching for overuse signs (side effects);\nposition comfortably and transport promptly [153].\nFor asthma, be ready to suction, assist with an inhaler, provide aggressive\nairway management, oxygen, and prompt transport [155].\nHay fever is usually not an emergency, manage the airway and give oxygen\nbased on distress level [157].\nAnaphylaxis is a true emergency; remove the offending agent, provide\naggressive airway management, oxygen, prompt transport, and administer Epi\nif allowed by protocol [158].\nFor spontaneous pneumothorax, provide oxygen, transport to the hospital,\nand monitor carefully [160].\nFor pleural effusions, fluid removal must be done at the hospital; provide\noxygen and transport promptly [161].\nFor airway obstruction: partial obstruction gets supplemental oxygen only;\ncomplete obstruction requires clearing the obstruction then administering\noxygen [162]. Transport rapidly to the emergency department [164].\nFor pulmonary emboli, supplemental oxygen is mandatory; position\ncomfortably; clear the airway immediately if coughing up blood; prompt\ntransport is needed [165].\nFor hyperventilation, complete primary assessment and gather history; never\nhave the patient breathe in a paper bag; reassure and provide oxygen if\nnecessary; prompt transport [167].\nFor environmental or industrial exposure, ensure patients are\ndecontaminated; treat with oxygen and adjuncts if needed; suction based on\npresentation [170].\nFor foreign body airway obstruction, perform age-specific clearing\ntechniques, provide oxygen, and transport [171].\nFor tracheostomy dysfunction, position comfortably, suction to clear\nobstruction, then oxygenate [172].\nFor asthma in children, give blow-by oxygen and use metered-dose inhalers\nas with older patients [173]. Asthma can be life-threatening in older adults [173].\nCystic fibrosis is a genetic disorder affecting lungs/digestive system,\npredisposing children to lung infections [174]. Symptoms vary; suction and\noxygenate these patients [174].\nCondition Treatment Approach\nUpper/Lower Airway\nInfection\nAdminister humidified oxygen [145]\nSuspected Epiglottitis Do not suction or place OPA, position comfortably,\ntransport [146]\nPulmonary Edema 100% oxygen, suction if needed, position\ncomfortably (seated), CPAP if indicated/allowed,\nprompt transport [148]\nCOPD Assist with inhaler (watch for overuse), position\ncomfortably, prompt transport [153]\nAsthma Prepare to suction, assist with inhaler, aggressive\nairway management, oxygen, prompt transport [155]\nHay Fever Manage airway, oxygen based on distress (usually\nnot emergency) [157]\nAnaphylaxis Remove agent, aggressive airway management,\noxygen, prompt transport, administer Epi (if protocol\nallows) [158]\nSpontaneous\nPneumothorax\nProvide oxygen, transport to hospital, monitor\ncarefully [160]\nPleural Effusions Provide oxygen, transport promptly (fluid removal at\nhospital) [161]\nPartial Airway Obstruction Provide supplemental oxygen [162]\nComplete Airway\nObstruction\nClear obstruction, administer oxygen, rapid\ntransport [162]\nPulmonary Emboli Mandatory supplemental oxygen, position\ncomfortably, clear airway if coughing blood, prompt\ntransport [165]\nHyperventilation Primary assessment, history, reassure, oxygen if\nnecessary, prompt transport (no paper bag) [167]\nEnvironmental/Industrial\nExposure\nDecontaminate, treat with oxygen/adjuncts, suction\nas needed [170]\nForeign Body Airway\nObstruction\nAge-specific clearing technique, oxygen, transport\n[171]\nTracheostomy Dysfunction Position comfortably, suction to clear obstruction,\noxygenate [172]\nAsthma in Children Blow-by oxygen, use MDI [173]\nCystic Fibrosis Suction, oxygenate [174]\n15. Review of Key Concepts\nThe process of oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange in the lungs is called\nrespiration [176]. Respiration is the exchange of gases between the body and\nits environment [176].\nAsthma is a respiratory disease causing obstruction of the lower airway\n(bronchioles) [177]. Croup and epiglottitis are upper airway infections [177].\nTuberculosis is a potentially drug-resistant bacterial infection transmitted by\ncoughing [178]. It is dangerous and resistant to antibiotics [179].\nCauses of acute dyspnea include asthma, pneumothorax, and pulmonary\nemboli [180]. Emphysema is a chronic respiratory disease, not an acute cause\nof dyspnea [182].\nBronchiospasm (narrowing/spasming of airways) is most often associated\nwith asthma [183]. Asthma is a reactive disease caused by bronchiole spasms\n[183].\nSudden onset of difficulty breathing with sharp chest pain and cyanosis\ndespite oxygen is indicative of a pulmonary embolus [184]. Pneumonia is\nslower, and MI can cause chest pain but this presentation is classic for emboli\n[184]. A pulmonary embolus is a blockage causing pleuritic chest pain [185].\nAlbuterol (a beta-2 antagonist/agonist) is the generic name for Ventolin or\nProventil [188].\nAn acute bacterial infection causing swelling of the flap covering the larynx\nduring swallowing (the epiglottis) is epiglottitis [189]. It is potentially lifethreatening\nand caused by bacterial infection of the epiglottis [190].\nDifficulty breathing, especially when lying flat, in a patient who recently had a\nheart attack suggests pulmonary edema from left-sided heart failure [191].\nLying flat allows fluid to cover more lung surface, while sitting up\nconcentrates it lower [192].\nA 29-year-old conscious and alert patient with 20 respirations is breathing\nadequately [194].",

Introduction to Cardiovascular Emergencies and the\nCardiovascular System\nCardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in America, accounting\nfor one in three deaths [5].\nEMS plays a crucial role in reducing these deaths [6].\nThis includes promoting healthy lifestyles and early medical care access [6].\nIncreased CPR training for the public is also important [6].\nUtilizing evolving technology in dispatch for cardiac arrest response helps [6].\nPublic access to defibrillation devices is a key factor [6].\nRecognizing the need for advanced life support care is vital [7].\nThe use of cardiac specialty centers is also beneficial [7].\nComponent Function\nHeart Pumps blood to supply oxygen and nutrients to body\ntissues [9]\nAtrium (Upper Chamber) Receives incoming blood [10]\nVentricles (Lower\nChambers)\nPump outgoing blood [10]\nValves Keep blood flowing in the proper direction [12]\nAorta Receives blood from the left ventricle and distributes\nit to arteries [13]\nCoronary Arteries Supply blood to the heart muscle [24]\nArteries Supply oxygenated blood to different body parts [27]\nArterioles/Capillaries Receive blood from arteries, exchange\nnutrients/oxygen for waste [30]\nVenules/Veins Receive blood from capillaries, return oxygen-poor\nblood to heart [31]\nVena Cava Returns oxygen-poor blood to the heart [33]\nRed Blood Cells Carry oxygen and remove carbon dioxide [37]\nWhite Blood Cells Fight infections [38]\nPlatelets Help blood to clot [39]\nPlasma Fluid that carries blood cells [39]\n2. Pathophysiology of Cardiac Conditions\nHeart-related chest pain often results from ischemia, meaning decreased\nblood flow to the heart [53].\nIschemia signifies an inefficient supply of oxygen and nutrients [53].\nIschemic heart disease involves reduced blood flow to heart muscle portions\n[54].\nIf blood flow is not restored, heart tissue will die [54].\nAtherosclerosis is a disorder where calcium and cholesterol form plaque\ninside blood vessels [55].\nThis plaque can completely block a coronary artery or other arteries [56].\nFatty material builds up with age, narrowing the blood vessel lumen [56].\nThe inner artery wall becomes rough and brittle [57].\nA crack in brittle plaque activates the blood clotting system [58].\nThis leads to a blood clot partially or completely blocking the artery [58].\nA thromboembolism is a blood clot floating through a blood vessel [59].\nIf it reaches a narrow area, it stops and blocks blood flow [60].\nTissues downstream of the clot will suffer from hypoxia [60].\nIf blood flow isn\u0027t resumed, the tissues will die [61].\nThis sequence is a myocardial infarct, or heart attack [62].\nDeath of heart muscle severely reduces the heart\u0027s pumping ability [63].\nCoronary artery disease is the leading cause of death for men and women in\nthe U.S. [64].\nPeak incidence of heart disease is between 45 and 64 years old, but it can\naffect people from teens to 90s [65].\nRisk factors for AMI can be controlled, such as smoking, high blood pressure,\nhigh cholesterol, diabetes, lack of exercise, and obesity [66].\nUncontrollable risk factors include age, family history, race, ethnicity, and\nmale sex [66].\nAcute coronary syndrome describes symptoms from myocardial ischemia\n[67].\nThis includes temporary ischemia causing angina pectoris or the more serious\nacute myocardial infarct [68].\nAngina pectoris occurs when the heart\u0027s oxygen need exceeds supply, often\nduring stress [69].\nIt can be a spasm but is usually from atherosclerotic coronary artery disease\n[69].\nAngina can be triggered by a large meal or sudden fear [70].\nPain typically goes away with rest when oxygen demand decreases [70].\nAngina pain is described as crushing, squeezing, or pressure [70].\nIt\u0027s often felt in the mid-chest or under the sternum [71].\nPain can radiate to the jaw, arms (often left), back, or epigastrum [72].\nIt usually lasts 3 to 8 minutes, rarely over 15 minutes [73].\nShortness of breath, nausea, or sweating may be associated [74].\nRest, oxygen, or nitro usually relieve it promptly [75].\nAngina is a serious warning sign, though it doesn\u0027t usually cause death or\ndamage [75].\nUnstable angina is pain without a specific increase in oxygen demand [76].\nStable angina is pain from exercise or activity increasing heart demand\nbeyond its blood flow capacity [77].\nPatients with chest pain should always be treated as if having an acute\nmyocardial infarct [78].\nAMI pain signals the death of heart cells due to blood flow obstruction [79].\nDead cells become scar tissue and burden the heart [80].\nHeart muscle begins to die about 30 minutes after blood flow is cut off [81].\nHalf the cells may be dead after about two hours [82].\nOver 90 percent of cells may be dead after four to six hours [83].\nOpening the coronary artery with drugs or angioplasty within the first few\nhours can prevent permanent damage [84].\nImmediate transport is essential [84].\nAMI is more likely in the left ventricle [85].\nSigns and symptoms of AMI include sudden weakness, nausea, and\nsweating [86].\nChest pain, discomfort, or pressure, often crushing or squeezing, is common\nand doesn\u0027t change with breathing [86].\nPain may be in the jaw, arms, back, abdomen, or neck [86].\nIrregular heartbeat, syncope, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, pink\nfrothy sputum, or sudden death can occur [86].\nAMI pain differs from angina: it may occur at any time (not just with exertion),\ncan last 30 minutes to several hours, and may not be relieved by rest or nitro\n[87].\nNot all AMI patients experience or recognize pain [88].\nA thorough assessment is needed for chest pain complaints [88].\nPhysical findings of AMI include a fearful or nauseated appearance [89].\nPulse can be fast, irregular, or slow (bradycardic) [90].\nBlood pressure can be decreased, normal, or elevated [91].\nRespirations can be normal or rapid and labored [92].\nMental status changes or feelings of impending doom may be present [93].\nDysrhythmias are abnormalities of heart rhythm [94].\nPremature ventricular contractions (PVCs) are extra beats in a damaged\nventricle [95].\nPVCs are usually harmless and common in healthy and sick people [96].\nTachycardia is a rapid heartbeat, 100 beats or more a minute [97].\nBradycardia is a slow heartbeat, 60 beats per minute or less [98].\nVentricular tachycardia is a very rapid heart rhythm, 150 to 200 beats per\nminute [100].\nIt can quickly deteriorate into ventricular fibrillation [101].\nVentricular fibrillation is disorganized, ineffective quivering of the ventricles\n[102].\nNo blood is pumped, and the patient becomes unconscious within seconds\n[102].\nDefibrillation may convert this rhythm [103].\nAsystole is the absence of all electrical activity [109].\nIt usually reflects a long period of ischemia [110].\nNearly all patients with asystole will die [110].\n3. Specific Cardiovascular Emergencies\nCardiogenic shock occurs when body tissues don\u0027t get enough oxygen due\nto heart malfunction [111].\nThis is often caused by a heart attack [113].\nThe heart lacks power to pump enough blood through the circulatory system\n[114].\nIt is more common in AMI affecting the inferior and posterior left ventricle [114].\nEarly recognition of shock is important [115].\nCongestive heart failure (CHF) often occurs after an AMI [116].\nCHF develops when the increased heart rate and enlarged left ventricle\ncannot compensate for decreased heart function [116].\nThe lungs become congested with fluid (pulmonary edema) when the heart\nfails to pump effectively [117].\nCHF can occur suddenly or slowly over months [117].\nAcute onset CHF with severe pulmonary edema is usually accompanied by\npink, frothy sputum and severe dyspnea [118].\nWith right-sided heart failure, blood backs up in the vena cava [119].\nThis causes fluid to collect in other body parts, resulting in dependent edema\nlike swollen ankles, feet, and legs [120].\nRight-sided failure can lead to inadequate blood supply to the left ventricle,\ncausing a drop in systemic blood pressure [121].\nPatients may show signs of both left and right-sided heart failure, as leftsided\nfailure often leads to right-sided failure [122].\nHypertensive emergencies involve a systolic blood pressure over 100 mmHg\nor a rapid increase in systolic pressure [123].\nA common sign is a sudden severe headache [124].\nOther symptoms include a strong, bounding pulse, ringing in the ears, nausea,\nvomiting, dizziness, warm skin, nosebleeds, altered mental status, or sudden\npulmonary edema [125].\nUntreated, a hypertensive emergency can lead to a stroke or a dissecting\naortic aneurysm [126].\nPatients should be transported quickly and safely [126].\nAdvanced life support assistance should be considered [127].\nAn aortic aneurysm is a weakness in the aorta wall [128].\nThe aorta dilates at the weakened area, risking rupture [129].\nRupture causes almost immediate death due to blood loss [129].\nUncontrolled hypertension is a primary cause of dissecting aortic aneurysm\n[130].\nA dissecting aneurysm occurs when the aorta\u0027s inner lining separates,\nallowing high-pressure blood flow between layers [131].\nSigns include very sudden chest pain in the anterior chest or back between\nthe shoulder blades [132].\nIt may be hard to distinguish from an AMI [133].\nImmediate, safe transport is crucial [133].\nCharacteristic Acute Myocardial Infarct\n(AMI) [134]\nDissecting Aortic Aneurysm\n[135]\nOnset of Pain Gradual, usually slow Abrupt without additional\nsymptoms\nDescription Tightness or pressure Sharp or tearing\nSeverity Increases with time Maximum on onset\n4. Patient Assessment and Emergency Medical Care\nPatient assessment starts with scene size-up to ensure safety and\ndetermine the nature of the illness [136].\nDispatch information, clues, and family/bystander comments help determine\nthe nature of illness [137].\nIn the primary assessment, form a general impression [138].\nIf the patient is unresponsive and not breathing, start CPR and call for an AED\nimmediately [138].\nAssess the patient\u0027s airway and breathing [139].\nIf dizziness or fainting occurred due to cardiac compromise, consider spinal\ninjury [139].\nAssess breathing to see if the heart gets adequate oxygen [140].\nIf shortness of breath with no respiratory distress and SpO2 below 95%, give\noxygen at 4 L/min [140].\nIf not improving quickly, use a non-rebreather mask [141].\nIf not breathing or breathing inadequately, use a bag-valve mask with 100%\noxygen [142].\nFor pulmonary edema, use positive pressure ventilations with a BVM or CPAP\n[142].\nAssess circulation: pulse rate and quality, skin color, nature, and temperature,\nand capillary refill [142].\nConsider treating for cardiogenic shock early to reduce the heart\u0027s workload\n[143].\nPosition the patient comfortably, usually sitting up and supported [144].\nMake a transport decision based on stabilizing life threats during the primary\nassessment [145].\nMost patients with chest pain need immediate transport [147].\nFollow local protocol for the most appropriate receiving facility [148].\nUse lights or sirens based on estimated transport time [149].\nTransport patients with cardiac problems gently to reduce stress [149].\nHistory taking involves investigating the chief complaint [150].\nConsider all complaints of chest pain, shortness of breath, and dizziness\nseriously [151].\nAsk about dyspnea: is it from exertion, position-related, continuous, or does it\nchange with breathing? [152].\nAsk about cough, sputum production, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, headache, or\npalpitations [152].\nAsk about recent post-trauma [152].\nObtain a SAMPLE history from responsive patients [153].\nAsk if they\u0027ve had a heart attack, if they have heart problems, or risk factors\nfor coronary artery disease [154].\nAsk about allergies and medications [154].\nUse the OPQRST mnemonic (Onset, Provocation, Palpation, Quality, Region,\nRadiation, Severity, Timing) for pain assessment as part of the SAMPLE\nhistory [154].\nThe secondary assessment focuses on cardiac and respiratory systems,\ncirculation, and respirations for chest pain situations [157].\nMeasure and record vital signs: pulse, respirations, systolic and diastolic\nblood pressure in both arms, and SpO2 with a pulse oximeter [158].\nUse continuous blood pressure monitoring if available [159].\nRepeat vital signs at appropriate intervals and note the time [159].\nA 12-lead ECG tracing is valuable as early as possible for chest pain patients\n[160].\nReassessment involves repeating the primary assessment to check for\nimprovement or deterioration [161].\nReassess vital signs at least every five minutes or with significant changes\n[161].\nSudden cardiac arrest is a risk in cardiovascular emergencies [162].\nHave an AED immediately available if cardiac arrest occurs [162].\nIf no AED, perform CPR until it is available [162].\nReassess interventions and provide transport if not already done [163].\nCommunication and documentation are essential [164].\nAlert the emergency department about the patient\u0027s condition and ETA [165].\nFollow medical control instructions and document assessment and treatment\n[165].\nEmergency medical care for chest pain includes ensuring a proper position\nof comfort [168].\nAllow patients to sit up if comfortable [168].\nLoosen tight clothing [168].\nGive oxygen if indicated and continually reassess oxygen saturation and\nrespiratory status [168].\nUse a nasal cannula for mild dyspnea, a non-rebreather for more serious\ndifficulty [170].\nCPAP may be indicated for pulmonary edema [170].\nAssist unconscious patients or those in obvious respiratory distress with\nbreathing [171].\nPrepare to administer low-dose aspirin and assist with prescribed nitro based\non protocol [171].\n5. Medications and Cardiac Monitoring\nAspirin prevents new clots or prevents existing clots from getting bigger [173].\nThe recommended dose is 162 to 324 mg [173].\nLow-dose aspirin is 81 mg [174].\nNitroglycerin (Nitro) is available as a tablet, spray, or skin patch [175].\nNitro relaxes blood vessel wall muscles and dilates coronary arteries [176].\nThis increases blood flow and supply to the heart [176].\nIt also decreases the workload of the heart [177].\nSide effects include decreased blood pressure and severe headache [178].\nContraindications for nitro include systolic blood pressure less than 100\nmmHg [179].\nHead injury is also a contraindication [179].\nUse of erectile dysfunction drugs within 24 to 48 hours is a contraindication\n[179].\nIf the maximum prescribed dose (three doses) has been taken, it is\ncontraindicated [180].\nFor cardiac monitoring to be reliable, electrodes must be placed consistently\n[181].\nBasic principles for best skin contact and minimizing artifact should be\nfollowed [182].\nShaving body hair from the electrode site may be needed [183].\nRub the electrode site with an alcohol swab to remove oils and dead tissue\n[183].\nAttach electrodes to EKG cables before placement [183].\nConfirm correct placement of electrodes on the chest or limbs [183].\nOnce electrodes are in place, switch on the monitor [185].\nPrint a sample rhythm strip to check for artifact [185].\nVerify that electrodes are firmly applied and the cable is plugged correctly\n[186].\n6. Cardiac Surgeries and Assist Devices\nOpen heart surgeries have been performed for decades to bypass damaged\ncoronary arteries [187].\nIn a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), a vessel from the chest or leg is\nsewn from the aorta to the coronary artery beyond the obstruction [188].\nPercutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) dilates the\naffected artery instead of bypassing it [189].\nPTCA involves introducing a long, thin tube with a tiny balloon into a large\nartery [190].\nThe tube is threaded into the narrowed coronary artery and the balloon is\ninflated [191].\nThe balloon is then deflated, and the tube and balloon are removed [192].\nSometimes a stent is placed inside the artery [193].\nPatients with bypass procedures may have a chest scar [194].\nTreat chest pain in patients with these procedures the same as those without\n[195].\nSome people have cardiac pacemakers to maintain regular rhythm and rate\n[196].\nPacemakers are used when the heart\u0027s electrical system is damaged [197].\nThese battery-powered devices deliver electrical impulses through wires\ncontacting the myocardium [198].\nThe generator is typically placed under muscle or skin in the upper chest [198].\nEMTs don\u0027t normally need to worry about pacemaker problems [199].\nMalfunctioning pacemakers can cause syncope, dizziness, or weakness due\nto a slow heart rate [199].\nThe pulse will usually be less than 60 beats per minute [200].\nPatients with a malfunctioning pacemaker need prompt transport [200].\nAED pads should not be placed directly over a pacemaker [201].\nAutomatic implantable cardiac defibrillators (AICDs) are used in patients\nwho survived cardiac arrest from ventricular fibrillation [202].\nAICDs continuously monitor heart rhythm and deliver shocks when needed\n[202].\nTreat patients with AICDs like any AMI patient, including CPR and AED use if\nthey go into cardiac arrest [203].\nThe AICD\u0027s electricity is low and won\u0027t affect rescuers [204].\nAn external defibrillator vest has built-in monitoring electrodes and\ndefibrillation pads [205].\nThe vest is worn under clothing and attached to a monitor [206].\nIt uses high-energy shocks similar to an AED [207].\nAvoid contact with the patient if the vest warns of a shock [207].\nThe vest should stay in place during CPR unless it interferes with\ncompressions [208].\nTo remove the device or vest, remove the battery from the monitor, then the\ndevice [209].\nLVADs (left ventricular assist devices) enhance the left ventricle\u0027s pumping\nin severe heart failure or after an MI [211].\nMost common LVADs have an internal pump and external battery pack [213].\nPumps are almost always continuous, so most patients won\u0027t have a palpable\npulse unless the device malfunctions [214].\nEMTs shouldn\u0027t typically deal with LVAD issues directly [215].\nContact medical control if unsure what to do [216].\nTransport all LVAD supplies and battery packs with the patient [216].\n7. Cardiac Arrest and Defibrillation\nCardiac arrest is the complete stop of heart activity, electrical, mechanical, or\nboth [218].\nIt is indicated by the presence or absence of a carotid pulse [219].\nCardiac arrest was nearly always fatal until CPR and external defibrillation in\nthe 1960s [219].\nWith good CPR, early defibrillation, and advanced care access, some patients\ncan survive without neurological damage [220].\nAn Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is a computer that analyzes heart\nelectrical signals [221].\nIt identifies ventricular fibrillation and is highly accurate [223].\nAn AED administers a shock when needed [224].\nAED models require some operator interaction, like applying pads or turning\nthe machine on [225].\nThe operator must push a button to deliver a shock [226].\nMany AEDs use a computer voice to guide the EMT through steps [226].\nMost AEDs are semi-automated and very accurate [226].\nAdvantages of AEDs include quick shock delivery [227].\nThey are easy to operate and don\u0027t require advanced life support on scene\n[227].\nRemote adhesive defibrillator pads are safe to use [227].\nLarge pad area with manual paddles makes electricity transmission more\nefficient [227].\nNot all cardiac arrest patients need a shock, but all should be analyzed with\nan AED [228].\nSome rhythms, like asystole (flat line), indicate no electrical activity and don\u0027t\nneed a shock [228].\nPulseless electrical activity (PEA) is cardiac arrest with an organized electrical\ncomplex but no pulse; it doesn\u0027t need a shock [229].\nEarly defibrillation is essential for cardiac arrest patients [229].\nFew out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients survive without a rapid sequence\nof events [230].\nThese events are the chain of survival links [230].\nAll links must be present for survivability [230].\nThe links are: recognition of early warning signs and calling EMS immediately\n[231].\nImmediate CPR with high-quality chest compressions is crucial [231].\nRapid defibrillation is necessary [232].\nBasic and advanced EMS care is the next link [232].\nAdvanced life support with post-arrest care is vital [232].\nFinally, recovery is the last step [232].\nCPR helps by prolonging the time defibrillation can be effective [234].\nRapid defibrillation has successfully resuscitated many patients [235].\nDefibrillation works best within two minutes of cardiac arrest onset [235].\nNon-traditional first responders are trained to use AEDs [235].\nThe fifth link is advanced life support and post-arrest care [236].\nThis includes continued ventilations at 10 to 12 breaths per minute [237].\nMaintaining oxygen saturation between 94-99% is important [237].\nEnsuring blood pressure is above 90 mmHg is necessary [237].\nTargeted temperature management is used upon hospital arrival [237].\nCardiopulmonary and neurologic support, plus advanced\nassessment/interventions, are included [237].\nThe final link is recovery, which can take a year or longer for survivors [238].\nIntegrating AED and CPR involves working them in sequence [240].\nApply the AED only to pulseless, unresponsive patients [240].\nDo not touch the patient while the AED is analyzing or delivering a shock [240].\nCPR must stop while the AED delivers a shock [240].\nAED maintenance is important [241].\nBecome familiar with the maintenance procedures for your AED brand [242].\nRead the operator\u0027s manual [242].\nCommon AED errors include machine failure to shock V-fib [243].\nApplying the AED to a moving or transported patient is an error [243].\nTurning the AED off before analysis or shock is complete is another error [243].\nOperator errors include failing to apply AED pads [244].\nNot pushing analyze or shock buttons when advised is an error [244].\nPushing the power button instead of the shock button is an error [244].\nEnsure the battery is maintained and check equipment daily [244].\nAsk the manufacturer for a checklist of items to check [245].\nReport AED failures to the manufacturer and the FDA [246].\nFollow EMS procedures for notifying these organizations [247].\nMedical direction must approve the written protocol for cardiac arrest care\n[248].\nThe EMT team and medical director should review each AED incident for\nquality improvement [248].\nReview should focus on the speed of defibrillation [250].\nShocks should be delivered within one minute of the call [251].\nMandatory continuing education with skill review is usually required for EMS\nproviders [251].\nEmergency medical care for cardiac arrest involves ensuring AED electricity\ninjures no one [253].\nDo not defibrillate patients in pooled water [254].\nYou can defibrillate a soaking patient, but dry the chest first [255].\nDo not defibrillate patients touching metal that others are touching [255].\nCarefully remove nitro patches from the chest and wipe the area before\ndefibrillation to prevent ignition [256].\nShaving a hairy chest can increase conductivity [257].\nDetermine the nature of illness or mechanism of injury [258].\nSpinal mobilization may be needed for trauma patients during primary\nassessment [258].\nCall for advanced life support assistance for cardiac arrest patients in a tiered\nsystem [258].\nUse a well-organized team approach [258].\nThe AED algorithm guides actions [259].\nIf you witness cardiac arrest, begin CPR with chest compressions [260].\nAttach the AED as soon as it\u0027s available [260].\nFollow the skill drill for AED steps and local protocols [260].\nAfter AED protocol, one of three things likely occurs [261].\nA pulse is regained (ROSC - return of spontaneous circulation) [262].\nNo pulse, and the AED advises no shock [263].\nNo pulse, and the AED advises a shock [263].\nIf ALS is responding, stay and continue the shock/CPR sequence [264].\nIf ALS is not responding and protocols allow, begin transport [265].\nTransport if the patient regains a pulse [265].\nTransport after 6-9 shocks or if the AED gives three consistent \"no shock\nadvised\" messages separated by two minutes of CPR [265].\nCardiac arrest during transport: If a pulseless, unconscious patient becomes\npulseless during transport, stop the vehicle immediately [266].\nBegin CPR if the AED isn\u0027t immediately ready [267].\nCall for ALS and other resources [268].\nAnalyze the rhythm, deliver a shock if indicated, and immediately resume CPR\n[269].\nContinue resuscitation per local protocol [269].\nIf a conscious chest pain patient becomes unconscious en route, check the\npulse and stop the vehicle [270].\nBegin CPR, analyze the rhythm, deliver a shock, begin chest compressions,\nand continue resuscitation [270].\nTransport to the hospital is included [270].\nCoordinate with ALS personnel per local protocol [271].\nDo not wait for paramedics to arrive if an AED is available [271].\nNotify ALS personnel as soon as possible after recognizing cardiac arrest [272]\n.\nDo not delay defibrillation [272].\nInform paramedics of your actions upon their arrival and interact according to\nlocal protocols [273].\n8. Return of Spontaneous Circulation (ROSC) and Conclusion\nReturn of Spontaneous Circulation (ROSC) is when a pulse is regained [262].\nWhen ROSC is achieved, monitor spontaneous respirations [275].\nProvide oxygen via bag valve mask at 10 breaths per minute [275].\nMaintain oxygen saturation between 95% and 99% [275].\nAssess the patient\u0027s blood pressure [275].\nSee if the patient can follow simple commands [276].\nIf advanced life support is not on scene or en route, immediately transport to\nthe closest appropriate hospital based on local protocols [276].",

Introduction to Neurologic Emergencies\nneurologic emergencies include strokes, seizures, headaches, and altered\nmental status [2].\nUnderstanding the nervous system is important [2].\nStroke is a major cause of death and disability [3].\nNew treatments are available for stroke [5].\nSeizures and altered mental status can indicate brain disorders [6].\n2. Anatomy and Physiology of the Nervous System\nThe brain controls body functions like breathing and speech [11].\nThere are three main brain parts: the brain stem, cerebellum, and cerebrum\n[13].\nThe cerebrum is the largest part [14].\nThe brain stem manages basic functions like breathing and blood pressure [15]\n.\nThe cerebellum coordinates muscle and body movements [15].\nMessages travel through nerves and the spinal cord [21].\nBrain Part Location Functions\nBrain Stem Located below the\ncerebrum\nBlood pressure, breathing, swallowing,\npupil size\nCerebellum Located below the\ncerebrum\nMuscle and body coordination\nCerebrum Largest part, above\ncerebellum\nEmotion, thought, sensation, movement,\nsight, speech\n3. Common Neurologic Conditions: Headaches\nHeadaches are a frequent complaint [30].\nThey can be a symptom or a condition itself [31].\nMost headaches are not caused by serious issues [32].\ntension headaches are caused by muscle contractions from stress [34].\nmigraine headaches involve changes in blood vessels [36].\nMigraines can cause pounding pain, nausea, and visual changes [37].\nsinus headaches result from fluid in sinus cavities [40].\nSerious conditions like hemorrhagic stroke or brain tumors can cause\nheadaches [42].\nHeadache Type Cause Pain\nDescription\nAssociated\nSymptoms\nEmergency\nCare\nNeeded\nTension Muscle\ncontractions\n(stress)\nSqueezing,\ndull, ache\nUsually none Usually no\nMigraine Blood vessel\nsize changes\nPounding,\nthrobbing,\npulsating\nNausea,\nvomiting, visual\nwarning signs\nYes\nSinus Fluid in sinus\ncavities\nPressure Nasal\ncongestion,\ncough, fever\n(cold-like)\nUsually no\nSerious (e.g.,\nHemorrhagic\nStroke, Brain\nTumor,\nMeningitis)\nVarious,\nserious\nconditions\nSevere Varies, can\ninclude fever,\nseizures,\naltered mental\nstatus\nYes\n4. Common Neurologic Conditions: Stroke (CVA)\nA stroke is when blood flow to the brain is interrupted [43].\nThis interruption causes loss of brain function [43].\nThere are two types of stroke: ischemic and hemorrhagic [44].\nischemic stroke is most common, accounting for 87% [45].\nischemic strokes are caused by a thrombus or emboli [47].\natherosclerosis often causes ischemic strokes [48].\nhemorrhagic stroke accounts for 13% of strokes [48].\nhemorrhagic strokes result from bleeding in the brain [49].\nHigh blood pressure increases the risk of hemorrhagic stroke [50].\nTIAs (transient ischemic attacks) are temporary stroke symptoms [52].\nTIAs are warning signs for a larger stroke [53].\nStroke Type Cause Percentage of\nStrokes\nDescription\nIschemic Thrombus or\nemboli\n87% Blood flow blocked by a clot\nHemorrhagic Bleeding inside\nthe brain\n13% Blood vessel ruptures and\nbleeds into brain tissue\n5. Signs and Symptoms of Stroke\nGeneral stroke signs include facial drooping [56].\nSudden weakness or numbness on one side is common [56].\nDecreased movement or sensation can occur [57].\nLack of coordination or balance may be present [57].\nVision problems like sudden loss or double vision can happen [57].\nDifficulty swallowing may occur [58].\nPatients may have a decreased level of responsiveness [58].\nSpeech disorders, including aphasia, are possible [58].\naphasia is difficulty speaking or understanding words [58].\nSlurred speech can be a symptom [58].\nSudden and severe headache can occur [58].\nConfusion or dizziness may be present [58].\nWeakness, combativeness, or restlessness can happen [58].\nTongue deviation is a possible sign [58].\nComa can occur [58].\nLeft hemisphere strokes may cause aphasia and right-side paralysis [59].\nRight hemisphere strokes may cause left-side paralysis [62].\nPatients with right hemisphere strokes may neglect problems or lack pain\nsensation [62].\n6. Conditions Mimicking Stroke and Intracranial Bleeding\nSome conditions can look like a stroke [64].\nHypoglycemia (low blood sugar) can mimic stroke [64].\nThe post-ictal state after a seizure can also look like stroke [64].\nSubdural or epidural bleeding can present similarly [64].\nTrauma to the head can cause intracranial bleeding [66].\nEpidural bleeding is outside the dura and under the skull [66].\nSubdural bleeding is beneath the dura but outside the brain [66].\nCondition Mimicking Stroke Description\nHypoglycemia Low blood sugar levels\nPostictal State The state immediately following a seizure\nSubdural Bleeding Bleeding beneath the dura, outside the brain\nEpidural Bleeding Bleeding outside the dura and under the skull\n7. Common Neurologic Conditions: Seizures\nA seizure is a neurologic event from abnormal electrical brain activity [67].\nEpilepsy affects 3.5 million people in the US [67].\nSeizures fall into two groups: generalized and partial [68].\nPartial seizures are also called focal seizures [69].\nGeneralized seizures, or tonic-clonic seizures, affect both brain hemispheres\n[70].\nThey involve unconsciousness and severe muscle twitching [70].\nGeneralized seizures typically last several minutes [70].\nAbsence seizures involve brief loss of consciousness without motor changes\n[71].\nFocal seizures can have impaired awareness [73].\nFocal seizures may cause numbness, weakness, or visual problems [74].\nThey can also cause twitching or brief paralysis [74].\nFocal seizures with impaired awareness affect the patient\u0027s interaction with\nthe environment [75].\nLip smacking, eye blinking, or jerking may occur [76].\nPatients may smell unusual odors or see hallucinations [77].\nAn aura is a warning sign before a seizure [78].\nAuras can include visual changes or hallucinations [78].\nNot all seizures are preceded by an aura [80].\nstatus epilepticus is a seizure lasting over five minutes or recurring without\nregaining consciousness [84].\nSeizure\nGroup\nType Description Consciousness\nAffected\nMotor\nActivity\nGeneralized Tonic-Clonic Abnormal\nelectrical\ndischarges in both\nhemispheres\nYes Severe\nmuscle\ntwitching\nGeneralized Absence Brief lapse of\nconsciousness,\nseems to stare\nYes No change\nPartial/Focal Focal\n(Aware)\nAbnormal\ndischarges from\ntemporal lobe\nNo Twitching,\nbrief\nparalysis\nPartial/Focal Focal\n(Impaired\nAwareness)\nAltered mental\nstatus, does not\ninteract normally\nwith environment\nYes Varies\n8. Causes and Management of Seizures\nCommon seizure causes include congenital, metabolic, or febrile conditions\n[86].\nEpileptic seizures are often controlled with medication [87].\nMedications include Keppra, Dilantin, and phenobarbital [88].\nRecognizing a seizure and the post-ictal state is important [89].\nThe post-ictal state occurs after the seizure stops [90].\nMuscles relax and breathing may be labored during the post-ictal state [90].\nWeakness on one side (hemiparesis) can resemble a stroke [90].\nLethargy and confusion are common in the post-ictal state [91].\nSeizures can be mistaken for syncope (fainting) [92].\nFainting typically happens when standing and lacks a post-ictal state [92].\nProlonged or recurring seizures are life-threatening [85].\n9. Common Neurologic Conditions: Altered Mental Status\nAltered mental status is a common neurologic emergency besides stroke and\nseizure [93].\nMany things can cause altered mental status [94].\nCauses include hypoglycemia (low sugar) and hypoxia [94].\nIntoxication and delirium are possible causes [94].\nDrug overdose can lead to altered mental status [94].\nAn unrecognized head injury can be a cause [94].\nBrain infection or tumors can cause it [94].\nBody temperature abnormalities may lead to altered mental status [94].\nPoisoning is also a possible cause [94].\nCauses of Altered Mental Status\nHypoglycemia (Low blood sugar)\nHypoxia\nIntoxication\nDelirium\nDrug overdose\nUnrecognized head injury\nBrain infection\nBody temperature abnormalities\nBrain tumor\nPoisoning\n10. Patient Assessment in Neurologic Emergencies\nPatient assessment starts with scene size-up [96].\nDetermine if it\u0027s a medical or trauma situation [96].\nPerform a rapid primary assessment for life threats [98].\nGather history from family or bystanders if the patient is unresponsive [99].\nLook for clues explaining altered mental status [99].\nObtain vital signs, including blood glucose levels [102].\nHigh blood pressure or erratic respirations can indicate intracranial pressure\n[102].\nUnequal pupil size suggests pressure in the brain [104].\nStroke assessment scales are used [107].\nBE FAST is a stroke mnemonic [108].\nThe Cincinnati and Los Angeles Pre-hospital Stroke Scales are common [109].\nThe glasgow coma scale (GCS) assesses neurologic status [111].\nThe GCS includes eye opening, verbal response, and motor response [117].\nGCS scores range from 3 to 15 [118].\nAssessment Scale Components\nBE FAST Mnemonic Balance, Eyes, Facial droop, Arm drift, Speech,\nTime\nCincinnati Pre-hospital Stroke\nScale\nFacial droop, Arm drift, Speech\nLos Angeles Pre-hospital Stroke\nScreen\nVarious criteria assessing stroke probability\nThree-Item Stroke Severity Scale LAG\nLos Angeles Motor Scale LAMS\nGlasgow Coma Scale (GCS) Eye opening, Best verbal response, Best motor\nresponse\n11. Reassessment and Treatment Principles\nReassessment includes checking ABCs and vital signs [119].\nCompare current findings to the initial assessment [120].\nWatch for changes in pulse, blood pressure, respirations, and GCS score [121].\nNotify the hospital of the patient\u0027s condition [121].\nFor suspected stroke, doctors need to check for bleeding [122].\nClot-dissolving medicine may be given if no bleeding is present [123].\nNotify the hospital about the last normal time for a stroke patient [124].\nSeizure patients need hospital evaluation [125].\nProtect seizing patients from harm [126].\nMaintain an open airway and provide oxygen for seizures [126].\nConsider spinal immobilization for head or neck trauma [126].\nFor status epilepticus, provide ventilations and transport quickly [127].\nSudden severe headaches, especially with fever or altered mental status, are\nconcerning [128].\nFor migraines, assess for serious conditions [129].\nProvide high-flow oxygen if tolerated for migraines [130].\nKeep the environment dark and quiet for migraine transport [131].\nAvoid using sirens or lights during migraine transport [131].\nFor stroke care, support ABCs and transport to a stroke center [132].\nMaintain oxygen saturation of at least 94% [133].\nFibrinolytic therapy can reverse stroke symptoms if given early [135].\nFor seizures, assess and treat ABCs [136].\nProtect seizing patients from harm [137].\nFor altered mental status, determine the cause [138].\nSpinal immobilization and airway support may be needed [138].\nTransport patients to the correct facility [139].\n12. Review Questions and Key Takeaways\nDysfunction causing slow pulse, irregular breathing, and dilated pupils likely\nindicates brain stem issues [142]. The brain stem controls these basic\nfunctions [145].\nAn acute ischemic stroke is caused by a blocked cerebral artery [146]. This\nblock is from a thrombus or emboli [147].\nSudden severe headache with high blood pressure and unresponsiveness\nsuggests a hemorrhagic stroke [148]. This is often due to a ruptured cerebral\nartery [151].\nTIA symptoms resolve within 24 hours, unlike some ischemic stroke\nsymptoms [151].\nSlurred speech difficult to understand is called dysarthria [152].\nSevere twitching of all muscles lasting minutes or longer is a generalized\nseizure [154].\nPrompt transport for stroke patients is crucial for potential clot-busting\nmedication [156].\nThe cincinnati pre-hospital stroke scale includes facial symmetry, arm drift,\nand speech assessment [157].\nA patient opening eyes to name, making incomprehensible sounds, and\nwithdrawing from pain has a GCS of 9 [158].\nPatients with severe migraines should be transported without lights and\nsirens [160]. Oxygen can be given if tolerated [162].",

Patient Assessment for Abdominal Emergencies A\n7. Emergency Care and Management A\n8. Review and Key Concepts A\n1. Introduction to Gastrointestinal and Urologic Emergencies\nThis chapter covers gastrointestinal and urologic emergencies for EMTs [1].\nIt is important to understand the anatomy and physiology of these systems [2]\n.\nEMTs will assess and manage patients with various abdominal complaints [3].\nThese complaints include abdominal pain, hypoglycemia, and\nhyperglycemia [3].\nThey also include shock related to acute or chronic gastrointestinal\ndisorders [3].\nHemorrhage, peritonitis, and renal system complications are also covered\n[3].\nYou do not need to determine the exact cause of abdominal pain [7].\nRecognize life-threatening problems and act quickly [8].\nRapid assessment and emotional support are needed for anxious patients in\npain [9].\n2. Anatomy and Physiology of the Abdominal Cavity\nThe abdominal cavity holds solid and hollow organs [9].\nThese organs belong to three systems: gastrointestinal, genital, and urinary\n[10].\nSolid organ injury can cause shock and bleeding [11].\nIf a hollow organ perforates, contents leak and contaminate the abdominal\ncavity [12].\nSystem Solid Organs Hollow Organs\nGastrointestinal Liver, Pancreas,\nSpleen [18]\nStomach, Gallbladder, Small Intestines, Colon\n[15]\nGenital Testicles,\nOvaries [28]\nEpididymis, Vas deferentia, Seminal vesicles,\nProstate gland, Penis, Fallopian tubes,\nUterus, Cervix, Vagina [28]\nUrinary Kidneys [31] Ureters, Bladder, Urethra [31]\nThe gastrointestinal system is for digestion [14].\nDigestion starts in the mouth [15].\nThe stomach breaks down food with gastric juices [15].\nThe liver helps digestion by secreting bile [17].\nIt filters toxic substances and produces blood clotting factors [18].\nThe gallbladder stores bile [19].\nFood goes to the small intestines with three sections [20].\nThe duodenum mixes digestive juices from the pancreas and liver [21].\nThe pancreas secretes enzymes for starches, fats, and proteins [22].\nThe jejunum absorbs digestive products [23].\nThe ileum absorbs later nutrients and bile acids [25].\nThe colon (large intestines) absorbs water and forms stool [26].\nThe spleen is in the abdomen but has no digestive function [27].\nThe abdominal space also contains reproductive organs [27].\nMale organs include testicles and penis [28].\nFemale organs include ovaries and uterus [29].\nThe urinary system controls waste discharge filtered by the kidneys [30].\nThere are two kidneys, one on each side [32].\nUreters connect kidneys to the bladder [33].\nThe urinary bladder is behind the pubic bone [34].\nThe bladder empties through the urethra [34].\nAdults normally form 1.5 to 2 liters of urine daily [35].\n3. Pathophysiology of Abdominal Conditions\nThe peritoneum is a membrane lining the abdominal cavity and covering\norgans [38].\nThe parietal peritoneum lines the cavity walls [40].\nThe visceral peritoneum covers the organs [40].\nForeign material like blood or pus irritates the peritoneum [41].\nThis irritation causes peritonitis [41].\nAcute abdomen is sudden abdominal pain [42].\nIt often needs medical attention [43].\nPeritonitis can cause ileus, paralysis of intestinal contractions [43].\nIleus leads to retained gas and feces, causing distension [43].\nThe stomach empties by vomiting [43].\nDiverticulitis is inflammation of small pockets in muscle walls [44].\nCholecystitis is gallbladder inflammation [44].\nAcute appendicitis is inflammation of the appendix [44].\nCause of Acute\nAbdomen\nSigns and Symptoms\nUlcers [49] Gnawing stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, belching,\nheartburn [50]\nGallstones [52] Severe pain in upper right or mid-abdomen, nausea,\nvomiting, indigestion [54]\nPancreatitis [55] Severe pain in upper quadrants radiating to back, nausea,\nvomiting, distension [56]\nAppendicitis [58] Initial dull pain near naval, later radiating to right lower\nquadrant, nausea [59]\nGI Hemorrhage [63] Vomiting blood (upper GI), bright red stools (lower GI) [65]\nThe parietal peritoneum has nerves like skin nerves [46].\nThis helps identify localized pain [46].\nThe visceral peritoneum is supplied by the autonomic nervous system [47].\nThese nerves are less able to localize pain [47].\nReferred pain results from nervous system connections [48].\nCommon causes of acute abdomen include ulcers [49].\nUlcers are erosion of the protective lining [49].\nMost are caused by infection or NSAID use [50].\nComplications include hematemesis, melena, or peritonitis [51].\nGallstones can block the gallbladder outlet [52].\nThis can cause gallbladder inflammation [53].\nPancreatitis can be caused by gallstones or alcohol abuse [55].\nComplications include sepsis and hemorrhage [57].\nAppendicitis is inflammation or infection of the appendix [58].\nSigns include dull umbilical pain radiating to the right lower quadrant [59].\nNausea, vomiting, fever, and chills may be present [60].\nRebound tenderness can occur [61].\nComplications include abscesses, peritonitis, or shock [62].\nGastrointestinal hemorrhage is a symptom of other diseases [63].\nIt can be acute or chronic [63].\nIt occurs in the upper or lower GI tract [63].\nUpper causes include esophageal varices or Mallory-Weiss tear [64].\nLower causes include inflammation, diverticulitis, cancer, or hemorrhoids\n[64].\nEsophagitis is inflammation of the esophagus lining [66].\nGERD is a common cause [67].\nSymptoms include pain swallowing and heartburn [67].\nEsophageal varices are increased pressure in blood vessels near the\nesophagus [68].\nThis is often due to liver failure [68].\nAlcohol or viral hepatitis are common causes [69].\nPatients may show signs of liver disease [70].\nRupture is sudden with vomiting bright red blood, hypotension, and shock\nsigns [71].\nComplication is significant blood loss [72].\nMallory-Weiss syndrome is a tear at the esophagus-stomach junction [73].\nViolent coughing or vomiting is a cause [73].\nSymptoms include shock, upper abdominal pain, hematemesis, and\nmelena [73].\nGastroenteritis is infection with diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting [73].\nNon-infectious conditions can also cause it [73].\nSymptoms include diarrhea, cramping, nausea, vomiting, and fever [73].\nComplications include dehydration and shock [73].\nDiverticulitis is due to a lack of fiber causing hard stools [74].\nThis increases pressure and causes bulges in the colon walls [75].\nFecal matter gets caught, leading to inflammation and infection [76].\nPain is often in the left lower quadrant [77].\nComplications include perforation and shock [78].\nHemorrhoids are swollen blood vessels around the rectum [79].\nIncreased pressure in the rectum is a common cause [80].\nSigns are painless, bright red bleeding during defecation [81].\n4. Urinary System Emergencies\nCystitis is bladder inflammation, often a UTI [83].\nBacterial infection is a common cause [84].\nSymptoms include midline lower abdominal pain and blood in the urine [85].\nUrgency, frequency, pressure, and pain around the bladder occur [85].\nComplications include kidney infections [85].\nThe kidneys maintain homeostasis [87].\nUremia results when kidneys fail [87].\nKidney stones can cause blockages [88].\nAcute kidney failure is a sudden decrease in function [89].\nCauses include hemorrhage, dehydration, trauma, and shock [89].\nSepsis, heart failure, medications, and drug abuse can cause it [90].\nKidney stones are also a cause [90].\nIt may be reversible with prompt treatment [90].\nChronic kidney failure is progressive and irreversible damage [91].\nCommon causes are diabetes and hypertension [92].\nSymptoms include lethargy, nausea, headaches, and cramps [93].\nAnemia, seizures, and coma occur later [93].\nDialysis is eventually required [93].\nThese patients have an increased risk of heart failure and cardiac arrest\n[94].\nFor end-stage renal disease, dialysis is the definitive treatment [131].\nDialysis filters blood and removes toxins [132].\nMissing treatment can lead to weakness and pulmonary edema [133].\nDialysis machines function like normal kidneys [135].\nPatients undergoing long-term hemodialysis have a shunt connecting a vein\nand artery [135].\nThis shunt allows blood to flow to the dialysis machine [136].\nPeritoneal dialysis infuses fluid into the abdominal cavity [137].\nThe fluid stays for one to two hours [138].\nIt carries a high risk of peritonitis [138].\nAdverse effects of dialysis include hypotension and dysrhythmias [139].\nChest pain, muscle cramps, nausea, and vomiting can occur [139].\nHemorrhage from the access site is possible [139].\nInfection can occur at the access site [140].\nManagement of dialysis patients includes ABCs [140].\nProvide high flow oxygen if needed [140].\nManage bleeding from the access site [140].\nPosition the patient sitting up for pulmonary edema or supine for shock\n[140].\nPrompt transport is important [140].\nDialysis patients may have urinary catheters [141].\nCatheters can be a site of infection [141].\n5. Other Abdominal Emergencies\nGynecologic problems are a common cause of acute abdominal pain [95].\nLower quadrant pain may be related to the ovaries, fallopian tubes, or uterus\n[97].\nThe aorta lies behind the peritoneum [99].\nWeak areas can form an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) [99].\nCondition Description Signs/Symptoms\n(General)\nSigns of\nStrangulation\nAbdominal\nAortic\nAneurysm\n(AAA) [99]\nWeak area in the\naorta behind the\nperitoneum [99]\nDifficulty detecting,\ntearing back pain [100]\nMassive\nhemorrhage if\ntears or ruptures\n[102]\nHernia [103] Protrusion of\norgan/tissue\nthrough a hole\n[103]\nMay not have a\nnoticeable mass [106]\nNo longer\nreducible, pain,\ndiscoloration [109]\nAAA is difficult to detect [100].\nSigns can include back pain with a tearing sensation [101].\nUse extreme caution when assessing for AAA [101].\nIf an aneurysm tears or ruptures, massive hemorrhage can occur [102].\nA hernia is a protrusion of an organ or tissue [103].\nIt goes through a hole or opening into another body cavity [104].\nCauses include congenital defects or weak areas like the groin [105].\nReducible hernias can be pushed back and pose little risk [107].\nStrangulation is a serious injury [108].\nBlood supply is compromised by compressed tissues [108].\nSigns include a mass that is no longer reducible [109].\nPain and tenderness at the hernia site occur [110].\nRed or blue skin discoloration over the hernia indicates strangulation [110].\n6. Patient Assessment for Abdominal Emergencies\nPatient assessment starts with scene size-up [112].\nUse standard precautions [112].\nDetermine the mechanism of injury or nature of illness [113].\nAcute abdomen can result from trauma [113].\nDevelop suspicion for life threats based on assessment [113].\nPrimary assessment\u0027s priority is to identify and treat life threats [114].\nForm a general impression [115].\nAssess ABCs and Ds [115].\nAirway and breathing may be shallow due to pain [115].\nAssess for major bleeding during circulation assessment [116].\nAsk about blood in vomit or stools [116].\nPulse rate and skin condition indicate shock [117].\nCheck pulses in both feet [117].\nDifferent pulse strengths may indicate aortic dissection [118].\nImmediate transport is needed for signs of significant illness [119].\nTake a SAMPLE history [120].\nAsk about nausea, vomiting, and bowel changes [120].\nAsk about urination, weight loss, or belching [120].\nAsk about pain, other symptoms, or chest pain [120].\nSecondary assessment includes patient positioning [121].\nPositioning may give clues about the illness [121].\nThe physical exam involves assessing the abdomen [121].\nA normal abdomen is soft and not tender [121].\nPain and tenderness are common symptoms [122].\nLocalized pain can indicate the problem [122].\nAbdominal muscles may be rigid (guarding) [123].\nTake vital signs [124].\nHigh respiratory rate with normal pulse/BP may mean improper ventilation\n[125].\nHigh respiratory rate and pulse with shock signs may indicate septic or\nhypovolemic shock [126].\nAvoid blood pressure in an arm with a dialysis shunt [126].\nFrequent reassessments are important [127].\nAssess interventions like shock treatment [127].\nProvide emotional support [127].\nTransport in a comfortable position [127].\nConsider advanced life support [128].\nCommunication and documentation are important [128].\n7. Emergency Care and Management\nYou cannot treat the causes of pain, but you can provide comfort [128].\nLessen the effects of shock [128].\nTreat for shock even without obvious signs [128].\nPosition vomiting patients to maintain their airway [129].\nContain vomit to prevent infectious disease spread [129].\nUse biohazard bags [129].\nWear gloves, eye protection, gown, and mask [129].\nClean the ambulance and equipment after patient release [130].\nWash your hands even after wearing gloves [130].\nProvide low flow oxygen [130].\nThis may decrease nausea and anxiety [130].\n8.

Introduction to Endocrine and Hematologic Emergencies\nThis report covers endocrine and hematologic emergencies from Chapter\n20 [1].\nUnderstanding these conditions is crucial for emergency care and\ntransportation of the sick and injured [1].\nThe report aims to explain the significance and characteristics of diabetes,\nsickle cell disease, and clotting disorders [2].\nIt will also detail the assessment and pre-hospital treatment for these\nemergencies [4].\nThe endocrine system profoundly influences nearly every cell, organ, and\nfunction of the body [6].\nendocrine disorders often present with a variety of signs and symptoms [6].\nhematologic emergencies can be challenging to assess and treat in the prehospital\nsetting [7].\n2. Anatomy and Physiology of the Endocrine System and Glucose\nMetabolism\nThe endocrine system serves as a communication system within the body [8]\n.\nendocrine glands secrete messenger hormones that travel through the blood\n[8].\nThese hormones affect specific target organs, tissues, or cells [8].\nendocrine disorders arise from internal communication problems [9].\nA gland may overproduce hormones (hypersecretion) or underproduce\nthem (hyposecretion) [10].\nSometimes the gland functions correctly, but the receiving organ does not\nrespond [11].\nGlucose metabolism is vital, as the brain needs glucose and oxygen to\nsurvive [11].\ninsulin is necessary for glucose to enter cells [12].\ninsulin acts like a key unlocking the door for glucose [13].\nWithout sufficient insulin, cells do not receive energy [14].\nThe pancreas produces and stores two key hormones: glucagon and insulin\n[15].\nThe islets of Langerhans in the pancreas contain alpha and beta cells [16].\nAlpha cells produce glucagon [18].\nBeta cells produce insulin [18].\nThe pancreas secretes insulin and glucagon based on blood glucose levels\n[19].\nEndocrine\nGland/Component\nKey Hormones\nProduced\nPrimary Function\nRelated to Glucose\nSource\nPancreas Glucagon, Insulin Regulates blood\nglucose levels\n[15]\nIslets of Langerhans Glucagon (Alpha\ncells), Insulin (Beta\ncells)\nProduction site for\nglucagon and\ninsulin\n[16]\n3. Diabetes Mellitus: Pathophysiology, Types, and Complications\nDiabetes mellitus is a disorder of glucose metabolism [19].\nThe body has an impaired ability to get glucose into cells for energy [19].\nUntreated diabetes leads to high blood glucose levels [20].\nSevere cases can cause life-threatening illness, coma, or death [21].\nPoorly managed diabetes can lead to severe complications [22].\nThese include blindness, cardiovascular disease, and kidney failure [22].\nThere are three main types of diabetes [23].\ndiabetes mellitus type 1 [23].\ndiabetes mellitus type 2 [23].\ngestational diabetes (pregnancy-induced) [23].\nDiabetes treatments involve medications and injectable hormones [24].\nThese treatments lower blood glucose levels [24].\nIncorrect administration can create a medical emergency [24].\nhypoglycemia (low blood glucose) is life-threatening if untreated [25].\nhyperglycemia (high blood glucose) can result in coma or death [26].\nExcessive treatment (e.g., too much insulin) can cause life-threatening\nhypoglycemia [26].\nBoth hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia can occur in Type 1 and Type 2\ndiabetes [27].\nPatients often display signs and symptoms of high and low blood glucose [28].\nhyperglycemia and hypoglycemia can have similar presentations [29].\nPatients may have altered mental status and mimic alcohol intoxication [30].\nCharacteristic Diabetes Mellitus\nType 1\nDiabetes Mellitus Type 2 Source\nCause Autoimmune\ndestruction of\npancreatic beta\ncells\nResistance to insulin\neffects at cellular level\n[34]\nInsulin\nProduction\nPancreas produces\nlittle to no insulin\nPancreas produces insulin,\nbut cells don\u0027t respond\neffectively\n[34]\nOnset Usually early\nchildhood through\nfourth decade\nOften diagnosed at yearly\nmedical exam or from\ncomplaints\n[35]\nTreatment Requires external\ninsulin source\n(injections, pump)\nDietary modification,\nexercise, oral medications,\ninjectable medications,\ninsulin\n[35]\nCommon\nComplication\nDiabetic\nKetoacidosis (DKA)\nHyperosmolar\nHyperglycemic Nonketotic\nSyndrome (HHNS)\n[48]\n4. Hypoglycemia: Causes, Signs, Symptoms, and Management\nhypoglycemia is low blood sugar [31].\nIt can develop if a person takes medication but doesn\u0027t eat enough food [32].\nTaking too much medication can also result in low blood glucose levels [32].\nCommon reasons for low blood sugar include:\nCorrect insulin dose with a change in routine or more insulin than normal\n[75].\nCorrect insulin dose without the patient eating [75].\nCorrect insulin dose and the patient developing an acute illness [75].\nAll hypoglycemic patients require prompt transport [32].\nSigns and symptoms of hypoglycemia include:\nNormal to shallow or rapid respirations [75].\nPale, moist skin; diaphoresis [75].\nDizziness, headache [75].\nRapid pulse or normal to low blood pressure [75].\nAltered mental status [75].\nAnxious or combative behavior [75].\nSeizures, fainting, or coma [75].\nWeakness on one side of the body (may mimic a stroke) [75].\nRapid changes in mental status [75].\nhypoglycemia is quickly reversed by giving the patient glucose [76].\nWithout glucose, the patient can sustain permanent brain damage [77].\n5. Diabetes Mellitus Type 1: Characteristics and Diabetic\nKetoacidosis (DKA)\ndiabetes mellitus type 1 is an autoimmune disorder [34].\nThe immune system attacks pancreatic beta cells that produce insulin [34].\nMissing insulin means glucose cannot enter cells [34].\nThe pancreas does not produce its own insulin in Type 1 diabetes [34].\nOnset usually occurs from early childhood through the fourth decade [35].\nPatients with Type 1 diabetes cannot survive without external insulin [35].\nMany patients use an implanted insulin pump [36].\nThese pumps continuously measure glucose and provide insulin [37].\nThey can malfunction, leading to diabetic emergencies [39].\nAlways ask about the presence of an insulin pump [39].\nType 1 diabetes is the most common metabolic disease of childhood [40].\nNew onset Type 1 diabetes symptoms relate to eating and drinking [41].\npolyuria (increased urination) [41].\npolydipsia (increased thirst) [41].\npolyphagia (increased hunger) [41].\nWeight loss and fatigue [41].\nNormal blood glucose is between 80 and 120 mg/dL [42].\nWhen blood glucose is high, the kidneys\u0027 filtration system is overwhelmed [43].\nGlucose then spills into the urine [43].\nIf glucose is unavailable, the body burns fat for energy [44].\nBurning fat produces acid waste called ketones [44].\nKetone levels rise in the blood and spill into the urine [45].\nKidneys cannot maintain acid-base balance with high glucose and ketones\n[46].\nPatients breathe faster and deeper to release carbon dioxide and reduce acid\n[47].\nThis breathing pattern is known as kussmaul respirations [47].\nContinued fat metabolism and ketone production can cause diabetic\nketoacidosis (dka) [48].\nDKA is a life-threatening illness [48].\nDKA may present as generalized illness [49].\nSymptoms include abdominal pain, body aches, nausea, and vomiting [50].\nAltered mental status or unconsciousness can occur in severe DKA [50].\nDKA can result in death if not rapidly recognized and treated [51].\nBlood glucose in DKA is generally higher than 400 mg/dL [52].\nSigns and\nSymptoms\nDiabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA) Source\nRespirations Rapid and deep (Kussmaul respirations)\n[47]\nBreath Odor Sweet, fruity (acetone-like)\n[89]\nGeneral Presentation Generalized illness, abdominal pain, body\naches\n[49]\nGastrointestinal Nausea, vomiting\n[50]\nMental Status Altered mental status, unconsciousness\n(severe)\n[50]\nBlood Glucose Generally higher than 400 mg/dL\n[52]\nUrination/Thirst Polyuria, Polydipsia (especially new onset)\n[41]\n6. Diabetes Mellitus Type 2: Characteristics and Hyperosmolar\nHyperglycemic Nonketotic Syndrome (HHNS)\ndiabetes mellitus type 2 is caused by cellular resistance to insulin [53].\nObesity predisposes patients to Type 2 diabetes [54].\nThe pancreas produces insulin, but cells and receptors are dysfunctional [55].\ninsulin resistance can improve with exercise and dietary modification [56].\nTreatment includes oral medications [57].\nSome increase insulin secretion, posing a hypoglycemia risk [57].\nOthers stimulate insulin receptors or decrease glucagon effects [57].\nInjectable medications and insulin are also used for Type 2 diabetes [58].\nType 2 diabetes is often diagnosed at a yearly medical exam [58].\nComplaints relate to high blood glucose levels [58].\nThese include recurrent infections, vision changes, or foot numbness [59].\nSymptomatic hyperglycemia occurs with very high blood glucose [60].\nPatients have altered mental status due to combined problems [60].\nContrast with Type 1 diabetes:\nType 1 leads to ketoacidosis and dehydration from urination [62].\nType 2 leads to a non-ketotic state of dehydration [63].\nFluid is discharged from body systems and kidneys, causing imbalance [63]\n.\nLong-term hyperglycemia can cause complications [64].\nWounds that don\u0027t heal, numbness in hands/feet, blindness, renal failure\n[64].\nGastric motility problems [64].\nUncontrolled Type 2 diabetes can lead to hyperosmolar hyperglycemic\nnonketotic syndrome (hhns) [65].\nHHNS key signs and symptoms include:\nhyperglycemia [65].\nAltered mental status, drowsiness, lethargy [65].\nSevere dehydration, thirst, dark urine [65].\nVisual and sensory defects, partial paralysis, muscle weakness [66].\nSeizures [66].\nHigh blood glucose causes glucose excretion into urine [66].\nPatients increase fluid intake, causing polyuria [66].\nIn HHNS, patients cannot drink enough to keep up with high glucose levels [67]\n.\nUrine becomes dark and concentrated [68].\nSevere dehydration can lead to unconsciousness or seizure activity [69].\n7. Patient Assessment for Diabetic Emergencies\nBegin with scene size-up [78].\nBe cautious of syringes used for insulin [78].\nLook for clues like syringes, insulin bottles, food, or orange juice [79].\nUse standard precautions [80].\nQuestion bystanders about events leading to your arrival [80].\nConsider that trauma may also have occurred [80].\nDetermine the mechanism of injury (MOI) or nature of illness (NOI) [81].\nPerform a primary assessment [82].\nGet a general impression of the patient [82].\nIdentify threats and provide life-saving interventions, especially airway\nmanagement [83].\nDetermine the level of consciousness using the AVPU scale (Alert, Verbal,\nPainful, Unresponsive) [84].\nIf unresponsive and you suspect diabetes, call for Advanced Life Support\n(ALS) [85].\nPatients may have undiagnosed diabetes [85].\nAssess blood glucose levels in patients with altered mental status [85].\nPerform cervical spine immobilization if necessary [86].\nProvide rapid transport [86].\nAssess the patient\u0027s breathing [87].\nPatients with inadequate breathing, a pulse ox less than 94, or altered mental\nstatus need high flow oxygen (12-15 L/min via non-rebreather) [88].\nHyperglycemic patients may have rapid, deep (Kussmaul) respirations and\nsweet, fruity breath [89].\nHypoglycemic patients may have normal, shallow, or rapid respirations [90].\nIf the patient isn\u0027t breathing well, open the airway, insert an adjunct,\nadminister oxygen, and assist ventilations [91].\nMonitor ventilations throughout care [91].\nAssess circulation (the \"C\") [92].\nHyperglycemic patients often have dry, warm skin [92].\nHypoglycemic patients often have moist, pale skin [92].\nA rapid, weak pulse can indicate symptomatic hypoglycemia [93].\nMake a transport decision (the \"D\") [94].\nTransport patients with altered mental status and impaired swallowing [95].\nConscious patients who can swallow may be evaluated on scene [96].\nPerform history taking [97].\nInvestigate the chief complaint and obtain the history of the present illness\nusing OPQRST [97].\nObtain the patient\u0027s history [97].\nIf the patient ate but didn\u0027t take insulin, hyperglycemia is more likely [97].\nObtain a SAMPLE history [98].\nFor known diabetics, ask about insulin/pills, insulin pump use, insulin/pill dose\ntaken, food intake, illness, unusual activity, or stress [99].\nLook for emergency medical identification tags (wallet card, necklace,\nbracelet) [99].\nConduct a secondary assessment [100].\nFor nature of illness, focus on a neurological assessment [100].\nAssess non-responsive patients head-to-toe for clues and secondary injuries\nlike trauma [100].\nWhen diabetes is suspected, focus on mental status, ability to swallow, and\nairway protection [100].\nObtain a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score [100].\nObtain vital signs, including blood glucose level if possible [100].\nhypoglycemia vital signs: normal to rapid respirations, weak and rapid pulse,\npale and clammy skin, low blood sugar [101].\nhyperglycemia vital signs: rapid (maybe deep and rapid) respirations, rapid,\nweak, thready pulse, warm and dry skin, normal blood pressure [102].\nUse a portable glucometer if available and protocol allows [103].\nKnow the glucometer\u0027s operating ranges [104].\nNormal non-fasting adult/child blood glucose: 80-120 mg/dL [104].\nNeonate glucose should be above 70 mg/dL [104].\nAssessment\nStep\nKey Actions and Findings Source\nScene Size-\nUp\nBe aware of syringes; Look for clues (insulin, food);\nUse standard precautions; Question bystanders;\nConsider trauma; Determine MOI/NOI\n[78]\nPrimary\nAssessment\nGeneral impression; Identify threats; Airway\nmanagement; Determine LOC (AVPU); Call ALS for\nunresponsive suspected diabetics; Assess blood\nglucose (if training allows); C-spine immobilization\n(if needed); Rapid transport for altered mental\nstatus/impaired swallowing\n[82]\nBreathing\nAssessment\nAssess respirations; High flow oxygen for\ninadequate breathing, SpO2\u003c94%, altered mental\nstatus; Kussmaul respirations/fruity breath\n(hyperglycemia); Normal/shallow/rapid respirations\n(hypoglycemia); Open airway, adjuncts, assist\nventilations if needed\n[87]\nCirculation\nAssessment\nAssess skin (warm/dry for hyperglycemia,\npale/moist for hypoglycemia); Assess pulse\n(rapid/weak for symptomatic hypoglycemia)\n[92]\nHistory\nTaking\nInvestigate chief complaint (OPQRST); Patient\nhistory (eating/insulin status); SAMPLE history; Ask\nspecific diabetes questions; Look for medical ID tag\n[97]\nSecondary\nAssessment\nPhysical exam (focus on neuro); Head-to-toe for\nunresponsive; Focus on mental status, swallowing,\nairway protection for suspected diabetes; GCS\nscore\n[100]\nVital Signs Blood glucose level (glucometer); Hypoglycemia\n(rapid/weak pulse, pale/clammy skin);\nHyperglycemia (rapid/weak/thready pulse,\nwarm/dry skin)\n[100]\n8. Emergency Medical Care for Diabetic Emergencies\nReassess diabetic patients frequently [105].\nAssess changes in mental status and ABCs [106].\nEvaluate response to interventions [106].\nAdjust interventions based on glucose administration, readings, or\ndeteriorating consciousness [106].\nFor conscious hypoglycemic patients who can swallow [107]:\nEncourage glucose tablets or juice containing sugar [107].\nUse glucose gel or sugar drink if local protocol allows [108].\nProvide rapid transport for unconscious hypoglycemic patients [109].\nAlso transport patients with risk of aspiration (cannot maintain airway) [109].\nThese patients may need IV glucose, IM shot, or intranasal glucagon [110].\nMost EMTs cannot give glucagon [111].\nIf unsure if the patient is hyperglycemic or hypoglycemic, err on the side of\ngiving sugar [112].\nDetermining blood glucose can be hard if signs are confusing and you can\u0027t\ntest [113].\nPerform a thorough assessment in these cases [114].\nContact the hospital to help sort out signs and symptoms [114].\nCoordinate communication and documentation [114].\nPatients refusing transport after symptoms improve with oral glucose need\nthorough documentation [114].\nOral glucose preparations are available [115].\nRapidly dissolving gel [115].\nLarge chewable tablets [115].\nLiquid formulation [115].\nContraindications for oral glucose: inability to swallow and patient being\nunconscious [116].\nWear gloves before putting anything in a patient\u0027s mouth [117].\nFollow local protocols for glucose administration [118].\nReassess frequently and transport [118].\nhypoglycemia is a possible cause of seizures [119].\nSeizures may indicate a life-threatening underlying condition [120].\nManagement of seizures:\nMaintain the airway [121].\nPlace the patient on their side if no cervical spine trauma [121].\nDo not place anything in the mouth [121].\nHave suction ready if the patient vomits [121].\nProvide oxygen or artificial ventilations if cyanotic or breathing\ninadequately [121].\nTransport promptly [121].\nAltered mental status may be caused by complications like hypoglycemia or\nketoacidosis [122].\nUse the mnemonic AEIOU TIPS for altered mental status [122].\nAlways suspect and check blood glucose in patients with altered mental\nstatus [122].\nManagement of altered mental status:\nEnsure the airway is clear [123].\nBe prepared to provide artificial ventilations [123].\nBe prepared to suction if they vomit [123].\nProvide transport promptly [123].\nDiabetic emergencies can be misdiagnosed as neurological dysfunction or\nintoxication [124].\nAn emergency medical identification (bracelet, necklace, card) can be lifesaving\n[125].\nA blood glucose test can identify the real problem [126].\nBe alert for diabetes and alcoholism coexisting [126].\nRegarding airway management:\nDiabetic patients may not have a gag reflex and vomit [127].\nThe tongue may obstruct the airway [127].\nCarefully monitor the airway [128].\nPlace the patient in the lateral recumbent position [128].\nEnsure suction is readily available [128].\n9. Introduction to Hematologic Emergencies\nNow transitioning from endocrine to hematologic emergencies [129].\nHematology is the study of blood-related diseases [130].\nThree disorders can create pre-hospital emergencies [131].\nsickle cell disease [131].\nhemophilia [131].\nthrombophilia [131].\nanemia is also discussed [131].\n10. Anatomy and Physiology of Blood\nBlood consists of four main components [133].\nerythrocytes (red blood cells) [133].\nleukocytes (white blood cells) [133].\nplatelets [133].\nPlasma [133].\nEach component contributes to maintaining the body\u0027s hemostatic balance\n[134].\nRed blood cells contain hemoglobin [134].\nThey carry oxygen to the tissues [134].\nWhite blood cells respond to infection [135].\nThey collect dead cells and manage their disposal [135].\nplatelets are essential for clotting [136].\nPlasma serves as the transport medium for blood components, proteins, and\nminerals [137].\nBlood Component Function Source\nErythrocytes (Red\nBlood Cells)\nContain hemoglobin, carry oxygen to\ntissues\n[133]\nLeukocytes (White\nBlood Cells)\nRespond to infection, collect dead cells\n[133]\nPlatelets Essential for clotting\n[133]\nPlasma Transport medium for blood components,\nproteins, minerals\n[133]\n11. Sickle Cell Disease: Pathophysiology, Complications, and\nAssessment\nsickle cell disease, or hemoglobin s disease, is an inherited blood disorder\n[138].\nIt primarily affects red blood cells [138].\nIt is predominantly found in people of African, Caribbean, or South American\nancestry [138].\nPatients have misshapen red blood cells (sickle-shaped) [138].\nSickled cells lead to dysfunction in oxygen binding [138].\nThey also cause unintentional clot formation [138].\nSickle cells have a short lifespan, resulting in more cellular waste [139].\nThis waste contributes to sludging or clumping of blood [139].\nMaintaining hydration is important [139].\nInsufficient hydration increases blood clumping [139].\nComplications of sickle cell disease include:\nanemia, gallstones, jaundice, and spleen dysfunction [140].\nVascular occlusion with ischemia [141].\nAcute chest syndrome, strokes, joint necrosis, pain crisis [141].\nAcute or chronic organ dysfunction or failure, retinal hemorrhages [141].\nIncreased risk of infections [141].\nMany complications are very painful and potentially life-threatening [142].\nPatients are more susceptible to infections [143].\nAssessment findings in sickle cell crisis:\nIncreased respirations or signs of pneumonia [167].\nIncreased heart rate [170].\nSwelling of fingers and toes, priapism, or jaundice [173].\nPain (isolated or throughout the body) [174].\nVisual disturbances [174].\nNausea, vomiting, abdominal cramping [174].\nChest pain or shortness of breath [174].\nVital signs may be normal to rapid respirations, weak rapid pulse, pale\nclammy skin, or low blood pressure [177].\n12. Clotting Disorders: Hemophilia and Thrombophilia\nClotting disorders affect the blood\u0027s ability to clot properly [144].\nhemophilia is a rare disorder [145].\nOnly about 20,000 Americans have this disorder [145].\nhemophilia A affects mostly males [146].\nPeople with hemophilia A have a decreased ability to create a clot after injury\n[147].\nThis decreased ability can be life-threatening [147].\nPatients can be prescribed medications to replace missing clotting factors\n[148].\nMedications can also prevent the breakdown of blood clots [148].\nCommon complications of hemophilia A include:\nLong-term joint problems (may need joint replacements) [149].\nBleeding in the brain [149].\nThrombosis due to treatment [149].\nthrombophilia is a disorder of the blood\u0027s ability to flow smoothly [150].\nIt affects the venous and arterial systems [150].\nConcentrations of blood elements create clogging or blockage issues [151].\nthrombophilia is a general term for conditions causing blood to clot more\neasily [152].\nIt can be an inherited or genetic disorder [152].\nOther causes include medications, other factors, or cancer [152].\nClots can develop spontaneously in the blood [153].\n13. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Causes, Risk Factors, and\nTreatment\ndeep vein thrombosis (dvt) is a common medical problem [154].\nIt occurs in sedentary patients and those with recent injury or surgery [154].\nMethods to prevent blood clot formation include:\nBlood thinning medications [154].\nCompression stockings [154].\nMechanical devices [154].\nRisk factors for DVT include:\nRecent history of some type of replacement [155].\nComplications of leg swelling [155].\nRemaining sedentary for long periods [155].\nTreatment for DVTs includes anticoagulation therapy [156].\nOral medications are typically given for at least three months [157].\nA clot from a DVT may travel from the leg to the lung [157].\nThis causes a pulmonary emboli [158].\n14. Anemia: Causes and Impact on Oxygen Delivery\nanemia is an abnormally low number of red blood cells [159].\nCauses include chronic or acute bleeding [160].\nDeficiency in certain vitamins or minerals can cause anemia [160].\nAn underlying disease process may also be responsible [160].\nanemia impairs the blood\u0027s ability to deliver adequate oxygen to tissues [160].\nPulse oximetry may show inadequate saturation [160].\nThis can happen even if underlying tissues are hypoxic [160].\n15. Patient Assessment for Hematologic Emergencies\nBegin with scene size-up [161].\nEnsure scene safety [161].\nMost sickle cell patients have experienced a crisis before [162].\nWear gloves and eye protection at a minimum [163].\nDetermine the number of patients involved [163].\nBe alert for possible trauma [164].\nConsider advanced life support (ALS) [164].\nPerform a primary assessment [165].\nPerform cervical immobilization if needed [165].\nForm the general impression [165].\nProceed to the ABCs [165].\nFor inadequate breathing or altered mental status, give high flow oxygen (12-\n15 L via non-rebreather) [166].\nSickle cell crisis patients may have increased respirations or pneumonia signs\n[167].\nFor difficulty breathing, open the airway, insert adjuncts, administer oxygen,\nand assist ventilations if needed [168].\nAssess the patient\u0027s circulatory status [169].\nSickle cell crisis patients will have increased heart rate [170].\nThis helps force sickled cells through smaller vessels [170].\nFor suspected hemophilia, be alert for signs of blood loss [170].\nNote bleeding of unknown origin [170].\nBe alert for signs of hypoxia due to blood loss [170].\nMake the transport decision (the \"D\") [171].\nRapid transport to the emergency room is recommended for any patient\nexperiencing a sickle cell crisis or hemophilia [171].\nPerform history taking [172].\nInvestigate the chief complaint [172].\nObtain history of the present illness from responsive patients, family, or\nbystanders [172].\nBe alert for signs of sickle cell crisis [173].\nSwelling of fingers/toes, priapism, jaundice [173].\nAsk specific questions:\nIs pain isolated or throughout the body? [174].\nAny visual disturbances? [174].\nExperiencing nausea, vomiting, or abdominal cramping? [174].\nExperiencing chest pain or shortness of breath? [174].\nObtain a SAMPLE history from responsive patients or family [175].\nAsk if they\u0027ve had a crisis before, when the last one was, and how it resolved\n[175].\nAsk about recent illnesses, unusual activity, or stress [175].\nConduct a secondary assessment [175].\nSystematically examine the patient, focusing on the joints [175].\nEvaluate and document the mental status [175].\nObtain a complete set of vital signs, including oxygen saturation [176].\nNormal sickle cell crisis vital signs: normal to rapid respirations, weak rapid\npulse, pale clammy skin, or low blood pressure [177].\nUse pulse ox to monitor oxygen saturation [178].\nReadings may be inaccurate in anemic patients [178].\nAssessment\nStep\nKey Actions and Findings Source\nScene Size-\nUp\nEnsure safety; Be aware of prior crises; Wear\ngloves/eye protection; Determine patient number;\nConsider trauma; Consider ALS\n[161]\nPrimary\nAssessment\nC-spine immobilization (if needed); General\nimpression; ABCs; High flow oxygen for inadequate\nbreathing/altered mental status; Assess respirations\n(increased in sickle cell crisis); Open airway,\nadjuncts, assist ventilations if needed; Assess\ncirculation (increased heart rate in sickle cell crisis);\nBe alert for blood loss/hypoxia in hemophilia; Rapid\ntransport for sickle cell crisis/hemophilia\n[165]\nHistory\nTaking\nInvestigate chief complaint; Obtain history of\npresent illness; Be alert for sickle cell crisis signs\n(swelling, priapism, jaundice); Ask about pain,\nvision, GI symptoms, chest pain/SOB; Obtain\n[172]\nSAMPLE history (crisis history, recent\nillness/activity/stress)\nSecondary\nAssessment\nSystemic exam (focus on joints);\nEvaluate/document mental status; Obtain vital signs\n(including SpO2)\n[175]\nVital Signs Respirations (normal to rapid); Pulse (weak rapid);\nSkin (pale clammy); Blood Pressure (low); Pulse ox\n(may be inaccurate in anemia)\n[177]\n16. Emergency Medical Care for Hematologic Emergencies\nReassess vital signs frequently to track changes in the patient\u0027s condition\n[179].\nEvaluate the effectiveness of interventions performed [180].\nCommunicate with hospital staff for continuity of care [180].\nDocument clearly all findings and care provided [180].\nEmergency care for hematologic emergencies is mainly supportive and\nsymptomatic [182].\nFor patients with inadequate breathing or altered mental status, provide high\nflow oxygen (12-15 L/min) [182].\nPlace the patient in a position of comfort [182].\nTransport rapidly to the hospital [182].\n17. Review Questions and Conclusion\nThis concludes Chapter 20 on endocrine and hematologic emergencies [183].\nReview questions help assess understanding of the material [183].\nType 1 diabetes impairs glucose utilization because cells lack insulin [184].\nIn a patient with Type 1 diabetes found unresponsive, asking if they took\ninsulin is most important [186].\nDehydration in a diabetic patient with high blood glucose is due to the kidneys\nexcreting glucose and water [187].\nSkipping a meal but still taking insulin would most likely cause a hypoglycemic\ncrisis [188].\nFor an unresponsive diabetic patient, the first action is to open the airway [191]\n.\nkussmaul respirations (rapid and deep) are typical in diabetic ketoacidosis\n(dka) [193].\nExcessive urination, thirst, hunger, altered mental status, and fast breathing in\na child suggest a hyperglycemic crisis (DKA) [195].\nIf cells don\u0027t receive glucose, they metabolize fat [198].\nFat metabolism results in keto acids [199].\nCompared to a hyperglycemic crisis, a hypoglycemic crisis usually responds\nimmediately to treatment with sugar [200].\nPatients with DKA experience polydipsia (thirst) because they are dehydrated\nfrom excessive urination [202].",

Introduction to Allergy and Anaphylaxis\nThis chapter covers allergy and anaphylaxis. [1]\nEMTs often respond to calls involving allergic reactions. [5]\nAllergy-related emergencies can involve acute airway obstruction and\ncardiovascular collapse. [6]\nYou must be able to treat these life-threatening complications. [7]\nIt is important to distinguish between a usual response and an allergic\nreaction. [7]\n2. Anatomy, Physiology, and Pathophysiology of Allergic\nReactions\nImmunology is the study of the body\u0027s immune system. [8]\nThe immune system protects the body from foreign substances. [10]\nWhen a foreign substance invades, the body tries to activate or inactivate it.\n[11]\nAn allergic reaction is an exaggerated immune response. [13]\nIt is caused by the body\u0027s immune system, not directly by an outside\nsubstance. [14]\nThe immune system releases chemicals to combat the stimulus. [15]\nThese chemicals include histamines and leukotrienes. [16]\nBoth contribute to an allergic reaction. [16]\nAspect Normal Immune\nResponse\nAllergic Reaction\nCause Foreign substance\ninvasion\nExaggerated response to a\nsubstance [13]\nMechanism Inactivate invader [11] Release of chemicals [15]\nKey\nChemicals\nN/A (combats stimulus) Histamines, Leukotrienes [16]\nBody\u0027s Role Protects the body [10] Exaggerated response [13]\nDirect Cause Foreign substance Body\u0027s immune system [15]\n3. Recognizing Allergic Reactions and Anaphylaxis\nSome patients may not know what is causing their reaction. [17]\nYou must be able to recognize the signs and symptoms. [17]\nMaintain a high index of suspicion. [17]\nAn allergic reaction can be mild and local. [18]\nMild reactions are characterized by itching, redness, and tenderness. [18]\nAn allergic reaction can be severe and systemic. [18]\nThis severe systemic condition is known as anaphylaxis. [18]\nAnaphylaxis is an extreme, life-threatening allergic reaction. [19]\nIt involves multiple organ systems. [20]\nSevere cases can rapidly result in shock and death. [20]\nSeverity Signs and Symptoms\nMild Itching [18], Redness [18], Tenderness [18]\nSevere Urticaria (hives) [21], Angioedema [21], Wheezing or stridor [21],\nHypotension [22], Increased capillary permeability [22], Nausea [23],\nVomiting [23], Abdominal cramps [23]\n4. Common Allergens and Their Characteristics\nCommon allergens fall into five categories. [25]\nThe first category is food. [25]\nCertain foods like shellfish and peanuts are common triggers of\nanaphylaxis. [26]\nSymptoms may take over 30 minutes to appear. [27]\nSkin signs like hives may not be present. [27]\nReactions can be severe and involve respiratory or cardiovascular\nsystems. [28]\nThe second category is medications. [29]\nMedications are the second most common source of anaphylactic\nreactions. [29]\nAntibiotics like penicillin are common. [30]\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are also common. [30]\nInjected medications can cause immediate and severe reactions. [31]\nReactions to oral medications may take over 30 minutes. [32]\nOral medication reactions can also be very severe. [32]\nThe third category is plants. [33]\nThis includes dust, pollens, and other plant material. [33]\nPlants can cause rapid and severe allergic reactions. [33]\nCommon plant allergens include ragweed, rye grass, maple, and oak. [34]\nThe fourth category is chemicals. [35]\nCertain chemicals like makeup and paradine can cause reactions. [35]\nLatex is of particular concern to healthcare providers. [36]\nUse latex alternatives such as nitrile gloves. [37]\nThe fifth category is insect bites and stings. [38]\nThis involves venomation, where the insect injects venom. [38]\nReactions can be localized or severe and systemic.

Insect Bites and Stings: Specific Considerations\nInsect bites and stings involve venomation. [38]\nVenomation is the injection of venom by the insect. [38]\nReactions can be localized or severe and systemic. [38]\nApproximately 2 million Americans are allergic to bee, wasp, and hornet\nvenom. [39]\nAllergic reactions to stings cause at least 62 deaths per year in the US. [39]\nAbout half of victims had no prior reaction. [40]\nMost insects have a small hollow spine stinger. [40]\nHoney bees cannot withdraw their stinger. [41]\nAn embedded stinger can inject venom for up to 20 minutes. [42]\nWasps and hornets can sting multiple times. [42]\nFire ants strike repeatedly. [43]\nInitial signs include sudden pain, swelling, and localized heat. [44]\nWidespread urticaria, redness, itching, and a wheal may appear. [44]\nSevere cases (anaphylaxis) include stridor and bronchospasm. [45]\nWheezing, chest tightness, coughing, and dyspnea can occur. [45]\nAnxiety, gastrointestinal complaints, and hypotension are possible. [45]\nRespiratory failure can occasionally occur. [45]\nUntreated anaphylaxis can rapidly lead to death. [45]\nMore than two-thirds of anaphylaxis deaths occur within the first 30 minutes.\n[46]\n6. Patient Assessment for Allergic Reactions\nStart with scene size-up. [47]\nScene safety is most important. [48]\nThe environment or recent activity may indicate the source. [48]\nA respiratory problem dispatch report may suggest allergy. [48]\nRule out other causes of respiratory distress. [49]\nTrauma may be present secondary to the medical issue. [50]\nFollow standard precautions (gloves, eye protection). [50]\nConsider the need for advanced life support. [51]\nPerform a primary assessment. [52]\nQuickly identify and treat immediate threats. [52]\nABCs should be reassessed repeatedly. [53]\nForm your general impression. [54]\nAllergic reactions may present as respiratory or cardiovascular distress\n(shock). [54]\nIf the patient is anxious and in distress, call for ALS backup. [55]\nLook for a medical identification tag if unresponsive. [56]\nAirway and breathing are major concerns. [57]\nAnaphylaxis can rapidly cause upper airway swelling. [57]\nQuickly assess for increased work of breathing. [59]\nLook for accessory muscle use, head bobbing, and tripod position. [59]\nCheck for nasal flaring and abnormal breath sounds. [60]\nAssist the patient into a comfortable position (high Fowler\u0027s). [60]\nPlace in the supine position if signs of shock emerge. [60]\nAssist ventilations with a BVM and high oxygen for severe distress. [61]\nAssess circulation (C). [62]\nSome anaphylaxis patients show signs of circulatory stress (hypotension).\n[63]\nAssess for signs of hypoperfusion. [64]\nTreat for shock. [64]\nDefinitive treatment for anaphylaxis is Epi. [65]\nMake your transport decision. [66]\nImmediate transport is needed if anaphylaxis is suspected. [66]\nTransport if a mild reaction appears to be worsening. [66]\nIf the patient is calm, consider continuing assessment. [67]\nErr on the side of emergency transport. [67]\nTake a history. [68]\nInvestigate the chief complaint and history of present illness. [68]\nIdentify signs and symptoms. [68]\nObtain a SAMPLE history. [69]\nIf responsive, ask specific allergy questions. [70]\nAsk if interventions have been completed. [70]\nAsk if the patient had a severe reaction before. [70]\nAsk about ingestion of common food allergens. [70]\nInquire about gastrointestinal complaints (nausea, vomiting). [71]\nConduct a secondary assessment. [72]\nPerform a rapid head-to-toe exam if indicated. [73]\nFocus the physical exam on the chief complaint area. [73]\nRemove clothing if unconscious to look for clues. [74]\nLook for bee stingers or signs of chemical contact. [74]\nLook for a medical alert tag. [75]\nAuscultate for abnormal breath sounds (wheezing, stridor). [75]\nInspect the skin for swelling, rashes, or urticaria. [75]\nCheck vital signs. [76]\nAssess baseline pulse, respiratory rate, blood pressure. [76]\nCheck pupillary response and oxygen saturation. [76]\nSkin signs may be unreliable indicators of hypoperfusion. [77]\nStep Key Actions\nScene Size-up [47] Scene safety, identify source, standard precautions,\nconsider ALS [48]\nPrimary Assessment\n[52]\nIdentify life threats, ABCs, general impression, look for\nmedical tag [52]\nAirway/Breathing\n[57]\nAssess for swelling/distress, check work of breathing,\nassist ventilations [57]\nCirculation [62] Assess for hypotension/hypoperfusion, treat for shock [63]\nTransport Decision\n[66]\nImmediate if suspected anaphylaxis or worsening mild\nreaction [66]\nHistory Taking [68] Investigate chief complaint, SAMPLE history, ask specific\nallergy questions [68]\nSecondary\nAssessment [72]\nPhysical exam (rapid or focused), look for\nstingers/chemicals/medical tag, auscultate breath sounds,\ninspect skin [73]\nVital Signs [76] Assess pulse, respiration, blood pressure, pupils, O2\nsaturation [76]\n7. Monitoring and Reassessment\nMonitoring devices are useful. [78]\nA pulse oximeter helps assess perfusion status. [78]\nThe decision to give oxygen is based on airway, work of breathing, and lung\nsounds. [79]\nIt should not be based solely on pulse oximetry readings. [79]\nReassessment is crucial en route to the hospital. [80]\nRepeat the primary assessment. [80]\nReassess vital signs. [80]\nRepeat a focused exam of the affected system. [80]\nReassess unstable patients every five minutes. [81]\nReassess stable patients every 15 minutes. [81]\nWatch for signs of shock and treat immediately. [81]\n8. Interventions and Treatment for Allergic Reactions\nTreatment depends on the severity of the reaction. [82]\nMild reactions may need only supportive care and monitoring. [83]\nAnaphylaxis requires more aggressive treatment. [84]\nThis includes Epi and ventilatory support. [84]\nRecheck your interventions. [84]\nTransport to the emergency department is warranted even if the patient feels\nrelief. [84]\nThe medication\u0027s effect will wear off. [84]\nSymptoms will return. [84]\nAdminister BLS and provide prompt transport for severe reactions. [86]\nIf a stinger is present, scrape the skin with a stiff object. [87]\nUse a credit card or similar object. [88]\nDo not use tweezers or forceps. [88]\nGently wash the area with soap or mild anesthetic. [89]\nRemove jewelry from the area before swelling starts. [90]\nPosition the injection site slightly below heart level. [91]\nApply ice or cold packs, but not directly to skin. [92]\nLimit cold application to 10 minutes at a time. [92]\nBe alert for swelling and airway issues. [93]\nWatch for other anaphylaxis signs like nausea and vomiting. [93]\nDo not give anything by mouth. [93]\nPlace the patient in the supine position if indicated. [94]\nGive oxygen if needed. [94]\nMonitor vital signs. [95]\nBe prepared to provide further support. [96]\nSeverity of\nReaction\nTreatment\nMild [83] Supportive care, monitoring [83]\nSevere\n(Anaphylaxis) [84]\nAggressive treatment, Epi, ventilatory support, prompt\ntransport [84]\nSpecific Actions\n(Stinger Present)\nScrape stinger, wash area, remove jewelry, position site,\napply ice, monitor for swelling/airway issues, no oral intake,\nposition supine, oxygen if needed, monitor vital signs [87]\n9. Epinephrine: Mechanism and Administration\nEpinephrine (Epi) is a sympathomimetic hormone. [98]\nIt mimics the sympathetic \"fight or flight\" response. [98]\nIt causes blood vessels to constrict. [99]\nThis reverses vasodilation and hypotension from anaphylaxis. [99]\nEpi also increases cardiac contractility. [100]\nIt relieves bronchospasms in the lungs. [100]\nEpi can rapidly reverse the effects of anaphylaxis. [101]\nEpi is prescribed by a physician. [102]\nIt comes pre-dosed in an automatic Epi injector. [102]\nSome EMS systems carry Epi. [103]\nOthers allow EMS providers to help patients self-administer. [103]\nRefer to local protocols or medical control. [104]\nThe adult EpiPen delivers 0.3 milligrams of Epi. [105]\nIt uses a spring-loaded needle system. [105]\nThe infant/child system delivers 0.15 milligrams. [106]\nEpinephrine can take effect within one minute. [108]\nIt is the primary way to save someone with severe allergic reaction. [108]\nThere are side effects. [108]\nSide effects include high blood pressure, increased pulse, anxiety. [109]\nCardiac arrhythmias, pallor, dizziness can occur. [109]\nChest pain, headache, nausea, and vomiting are possible. [109]\nPatients without respiratory compromise or hypotension should not get Epi.\n[110]\nDo not give Epi if they don\u0027t meet anaphylaxis criteria. [110]\n10. Communication and Documentation\nDocumentation is important following an allergic reaction call. [85]\nInclude signs and symptoms found during assessment. [85]\nDocument the reasons for the care provided. [85]\nRecord the patient\u0027s response to treatment. [85]\n11. Review of Key Concepts\nWhat causes the signs and symptoms of an allergic reaction?\nThe release of histamine and leukotrienes. [112]\nWhat are the negative effects associated with anaphylactic shock a result of?\nVasodilation and bronchial constriction. [113]\nA 23-year-old male ate peanuts, has difficulty breathing, widespread\nurticaria, tachycardia, and hypotension (90/60). He is wheezing. What is most\nsuspicious?\nAn anaphylactic reaction. [114]\nWhat is a wheal?\nA raised, swollen, or well-defined area on the skin. [119]\nHow should you remove embedded stingers from a patient stung by hornets?\nScrape them with a stiff object. [120]\nA young male has anaphylactic shock after a scorpion sting, diminished\nconsciousness, severely labored breathing, inspiratory stridor, and cyanosis.\nHe has a prescribed Epi auto-injector. What should you do first if he\u0027s not\nbreathing?\nAssist with the BVM. [124]\nWhat is the most reliable indicator of upper airway swelling during a severe\nallergic reaction?\nStridor. [126]\nWhat is the most common trigger of anaphylaxis?\nFoods. [127]\nHow much does the adult EpiPen deliver?\n0.3 milligrams. [127]\nHow much does the infant/child EpiPen deliver?\n0.15 milligrams. [127]\nWhen administering Epi by auto-injector, how long should the EMT hold the\ninjector in place?\nFor at least 10 seconds. [128]",

Patient Assessment in Poisoning Emergencies A\n4. General Treatment and Activated Charcoal A\n5. Specific Types of Poisons and Their Management A\n6. Case Studies and Review Questions A\n1. Introduction to Toxicology and Poisoning\ntoxicology is the study of toxic or poisonous substances [5].\nA poison is any substance that can damage body structures or impair body\nfunction through chemical action [6].\nA toxin is a poisonous substance produced by bacteria, animals, or plants [7].\ntoxins act by changing normal cell metabolism or destroying cells [8].\ntoxins can have either acute (fast) or chronic (slower) effects [8].\nsubstance abuse is misusing any substance to produce a desired effect [9].\noverdosing is a common complication, occurring when a patient takes a\ntoxic dose [9].\nacute poisonings affect over 2 million people annually [4].\nchronic poisonings are more common [4].\nDeaths from poisonings are fairly rare [5].\nChild deaths from poisoning have decreased since the 1960s due to childresistant\ncaps [5].\nAdult deaths from chronic poisoning are rising due to drug abuse [5].\nRecognizing that a poisoning has occurred is your primary responsibility [10].\nPay attention to your surroundings for your own safety to avoid exposure [10].\nEven small amounts of some poisons can cause considerable damage or\ndeath [11].\nIf you suspect toxic substance ingestion or exposure, notify medical control\nimmediately [12].\nBegin emergency treatment at once [12].\nPoisoning Type Onset Duration\nAcute Sudden onset [4] Fast effects [8]\nChronic Longer-term [4] Slower effects [8]\n2. Routes of Poison Exposure\nHow you treat poisoning depends on how the poison entered the body [17].\nThere are four main routes of poison entry [17].\ninhalation [18]\nabsorption (surface contact) [18]\ningestion [18]\ninjection [18]\nAll four routes can lead to life-threatening conditions [18].\nRoute Description Initial Emergency Actions\nInhalation Breathing in\npoisonous\nsubstances [18]\nMove patient to fresh air [18]. Provide supplemental\noxygen [19]. Call Hazmat for toxic gas [19].\nImmediate transport [20]. Suction available [21].\nAbsorption Contact with\nskin or mucous\nmembranes [18]\nAvoid self-contamination [25]. Remove substance\nand contaminated clothing [25]. Flush and wash\nskin (brush dry powder first) [26]. Irrigate eyes [28].\nHazmat assistance [29]. Decontaminate thoroughly\n[29]. Prompt transport [30]. Obtain material safety\ndata sheet [31].\nIngestion Swallowing\npoisonous\nsubstances [18]\nTreat signs and symptoms [36]. Notify poison\ncontrol and medical control [36]. Protect airway if\naltered mental status [37]. Consider preventing\nfurther absorption (e.g., activated charcoal) [37].\nInjection Entry via\nneedle or bite\n[18]\nMonitor airway, provide high flow oxygen [40]. Be\nalert for nausea and vomiting [40]. Remove\nrings/watches/bracelets from injection site [41].\nCannot be diluted or removed in the field [38].\nPrompt transport [38].\n3. Patient Assessment in Poisoning Emergencies\nPatient assessment for toxins begins with scene size-up [42].\nScene size-up involves standard precautions [43].\nLook for clues like odors, bottles, syringes, pills, or chemicals [43].\nCheck for missing medication or drug paraphernalia [44].\nBe aware of potential drug labs [44].\nKeep an open mind and avoid mistaken conclusions [44].\nPrimary assessment determines the patient\u0027s condition severity [45].\nObtain a general impression [45].\nAssess level of consciousness and life threats [45].\nDo not assume a conscious patient is stable [45].\nAssess the ABCs and D [46].\nAirway and Breathing: Ensure an open airway and adequate ventilation [46]\n.\nProvide oxygen therapy for difficulty breathing [47].\nConsider airway adjuncts for unresponsive patients [47].\nHave suction ready as patients are susceptible to vomiting [48].\nCirculation: Assess pulse and skin condition [49]. Variations depend on the\nsubstance [49].\nTransport decision: Prompt transport for patients with altered ABCs or a\npoor general impression [50].\nHazardous material exposures require thorough decontamination by\nHazmat before transport [51].\nHistory taking is next, if the patient is responsive [52].\nInvestigate the chief complaint [52].\nObtain a sample history [53].\nAsk specific questions about the substance: what, when, how much, over\nwhat period, interventions used, and patient weight [54].\nIf the patient is unresponsive, get history from other sources [53].\nSecondary assessment focuses on the exposure route or affected body area\n[56].\nReview all body systems to identify systemic problems [57].\nObtain a complete set of baseline vital signs [58].\nChanges in consciousness, pulse, respirations, blood pressure, and skin\nindicate serious issues [58].\nReassessment is continuous [59].\nContinually check ABCs adequacy [59].\nRepeat vital signs and compare to baseline [59].\nEvaluate intervention effectiveness [60].\nTake vital signs every 15 minutes for stable patients, every 5 minutes for\nunstable patients or those who ingested a harmful dose [60].\n4. General Treatment and Activated Charcoal\nGeneral treatment principles involve supporting the ABCs [61]. This is the most\nimportant task [61].\nContact medical control or a poison center to discuss treatment [62].\nManage airborne exposures with oxygen [62].\nRemove contact exposures with copious water, unless contraindicated [62].\nConsider activated charcoal for ingested poisons [62].\nactivated charcoal binds to specific toxins [64].\nIt prevents toxin absorption in the body [64].\ntoxins are carried out in the stool [65].\nactivated charcoal is not indicated for certain ingestions [66].\nThese include alkali poisons, cyanide, ethanol, iron, lithium, methanol,\nmineral acids, or organic solvents [67].\nPatients with a decreased level of consciousness should not receive activated\ncharcoal because they cannot protect their airway [68].\nactivated charcoal often comes as a pre-mixed suspension, typically 50\ngrams per bottle [69].\nThe usual dose is one gram per kilogram of body weight for adults or children\n[69].\nAlways call medical control for pre-approval before administering activated\ncharcoal [70].\nShake the bottle vigorously to mix [71].\nConvince the patient to drink it, but never force them [71].\nRecord the time of administration [72].\nIf the patient refuses, document the refusal and your attempts to counsel\nthem [72].\nTransport the patient for further evaluation [72].\nSide effects of activated charcoal include constipation and black stools [73].\nIf the patient vomits after taking charcoal, the dose may need to be repeated\n[74].\nIndication Contraindication\nIngestion of\ncertain toxins\nIngestion of alkali poison, cyanide, ethanol, iron, lithium,\nmethanol, mineral acids, or organic solvents [67]\nPrevent toxin\nabsorption\nDecreased level of consciousness (unable to protect airway)\n[68]\nToxins carried out\nin stool\n5. Specific Types of Poisons and Their Management\ntolerance is when a person needs increasing amounts of a substance to\nachieve the same result [76]. This builds up over time [212].\naddiction is an overwhelming desire to continue using a substance, often\nincreasing the dose [77].\nSafety awareness and standard precautions are crucial when caring for drug\nabusers [78].\nKnown drug abusers have a high incidence of serious infections like HIV\nand hepatitis [79].\nThe drug user, not the drug, can pose the greatest threat [80].\nAlcohol is a central nervous system depressant, sedative, and hypnotic [85].\nIt dulls senses, slows reflexes, and reduces reaction time [87].\nIt can cause aggressive behavior and lack of coordination [88].\nBinge drinking (occasional heavy use) can be very damaging [84].\nSevere acute ingestion can cause hypoglycemia [90]. Check blood sugar\nlevels [90].\nAlcohol increases the effects of other drugs [91].\nProvide respiratory support for severe CNS depression [92]. Emesis can\nresult from respiratory depression [93].\nAlcohol withdrawal can cause hallucinations or delirium tremens (DTs) [94].\nDTs include agitation, restlessness, fever, sweating, tremors, confusion,\ndelusions, or seizures [95].\nWithdrawal symptoms can occur after stopping or reducing alcohol\nintake [96].\nProvide transport, reassurance, care, and emotional support for\nwithdrawal [96]. Withdrawal is as dangerous as too much alcohol [96].\nopiates are narcotics that produce sleep and altered consciousness [98].\nThey are used for pain relief [99].\nPrescription opiates are commonly abused [100]. Physical dependence can\ndevelop from medical prescriptions [101].\nopiates are CNS depressants and cause severe respiratory depression [101]\n. This can lead to cardiac arrest [101].\ntolerance develops quickly; users may need massive doses [102].\nNausea and vomiting are common [104]. Hypotension can occur [104].\nSeizures are uncommon but possible [104].\nPatients are typically sedated, unconscious, cyanotic with pinpoint pupils\n[105].\nnaloxone (Narcan) reverses opiate/opioid overdose effects [105]. It can be\ngiven IV, IM, or IN [106].\nEMTs often administer naloxone intranasally (IN) [107]. Use it for agonal\nrespirations or apnea due to opioids [108].\nAsk bystanders if naloxone was given before your arrival [111].\nSedative-Hypnotic Drugs (barbiturates, benzodiazepines) are CNS\ndepressants that alter consciousness [112].\nThey are easily obtained and relatively cheap [112].\nEffects are similar to alcohol; patients may be drowsy, peaceful, or\nintoxicated [113].\nTaken orally, sometimes dissolved or injected [115].\ntolerance develops quickly, requiring larger doses [116].\nCan be used as \"knockout drugs\" [117].\nTreatment: Ensure patent airway, assist ventilations, and provide prompt\ntransport [118].\nabused inhalants are agents inhaled rather than ingested or injected [119].\nInclude acetone, glue, cleaning compounds, paint thinners, lacquers,\ngasoline, Freon [121].\nCommonly abused by teenagers [123].\nEffects range from drowsiness to coma and seizures [123].\nHydrocarbon solvents make the heart hypersensitive to adrenaline [123].\nKeep patients from struggling or exerting themselves [123].\nProvide oxygen and transport [123].\nhydrogen sulfide is a highly toxic, odorless, flammable gas with a rotten\negg smell [124]. It affects lungs and CNS [125]. Used in \"detergent suicides\"\n[125].\nBe alert for warning signs, containers, buckets in enclosed vehicles\n[125]. Wait for Hazmat to declare the scene safe [125].\nSigns include nausea, vomiting, confusion, dyspnea, loss of\nconsciousness, seizures, shock, coma, cardiopulmonary arrest [126].\nAfter decontamination, management is supportive: monitor respiratory\nand cardiovascular function, provide rapid transport [127].\nCentral Nervous System Stimulants (sympathomimetics) mimic the\nsympathetic nervous system [129].\nThey cause hypertension, tachycardia, and dilated pupils [130].\nProduce an excited state [131].\nExamples: amphetamines, methamphetamines, MDMA (ecstasy/Molly),\ncocaine [131].\nCocaine can be absorbed through mucous membranes or skin [132].\nEffects last less than an hour [132]. Smoking cocaine (crack) gives the\nfastest and most potent effect [133].\nAcute overdose is an emergency due to high risk of seizures, cardiac\ndysrhythmias, and stroke [133].\nPatients may have hallucinations or paranoia [134].\nLaw enforcement may need to restrain the patient [134]. Do not leave\nunattended during transport [135].\nProvide prompt transport, supplemental oxygen, and be ready to suction\n[135].\nbath salts are synthetic drugs similar to MDMA [136].\nSold as bath salts to evade legal restrictions [139].\nProduce euphoria, increased mental clarity, and sexual arousal [140]. Users\noften snort it [140]. Effects can last 48 hours [140].\nAdverse effects: teeth grinding, appetite loss, muscle twitching, lip\nsmacking, confusion, GI issues, paranoia, headache, elevated heart rate,\nhallucinations [141].\nKeep the patient calm and transport [141]. Consider advanced life support;\nchemical restraint may be needed for safe transport [142].\nmarijuana contains thc, which produces the high [143].\nInhaling smoke causes euphoria, relaxation, drowsiness [144].\nImpairs short-term memory and complex thinking [145].\nHigh doses can cause depression, confusion, hallucinations, anxiety,\nparanoia [146].\nOften used to introduce other drugs [148].\nEdibles (baked goods, candies with thc) can cause cannabinoid\nhyperemesis syndrome [149].\nThis is extreme nausea and vomiting in chronic users, relieved only by\nhot showers/baths [150].\nSynthetic marijuana (spice) mimics thc effects but can have powerful and\nunpredictable outcomes [151]. Effects range from euphoria to loss of\nconsciousness [151].\nHallucinogens alter sensory perceptions [152].\nLSD (acid) is a classic example [153].\nCause visual hallucinations, intensify vision/hearing, separate user from\nreality [153].\nA \"bad trip\" can include hypertension, tachycardia, anxiety, paranoia [154].\nCare is similar to sympathomimetic overdose: use a calm, professional\nmanner [155].\nProvide emotional support [156]. Avoid restraints unless the patient is in\ndanger [157].\nWatch the patient carefully; never leave unattended during transport [158].\nRequest advanced life support if appropriate [158].\nAnticholinergic Agents block parasympathetic nerves [159].\nClassic signs: \"hot as a hare, blind as a bat, dry as a bone, red as a beet,\nand mad as a hatter\" [160].\nCommon examples: atropine, Benadryl, gypsum weed, Elavil [160].\nDifficult to distinguish from sympathomimetic overdose; both can cause\nagitation, high heart rate, dilated pupils [160].\nTricyclic antidepressants have significant anticholinergic effects [161].\nDeath can be rapid (normal to seizure/death in 30 mins) [161].\nImmediate transport is crucial [161]. Consider calling advanced life support\n[161].\nCholinergic Agents overstimulate parasympathetic functions [162].\nInclude nerve gas (chemical warfare) and organophosphate insecticides\n[162].\nSigns are easy to remember using mnemonics \"DUMBELS\" or \"SLUDGE M\"\n[164].\nDUMBELS: Diarrhea, Urination, Miosis, Bradycardia, Emesis,\nLacrimation, Seizures [164].\nSLUDGE M: Salivation, Lacrimation, Urination, Defecation, Gastric\nupsets, Emesis, Muscle twitching [165].\nAnticholinergics have the exact opposite effects [166].\nAvoiding self-exposure is the most important consideration [167].\nDecontamination is a priority [167]. hazmat teams often provide\ndecontamination [168].\nAfter decontamination, priorities are decreasing mouth/trachea secretions\nand providing airway support [168].\nAntidote kits exist for cholinergic agents, e.g., DuoDote auto-injector [169].\nDuoDote contains atropine and pralidoxime [170]. Use for known nerve\nagent/organophosphate exposure with symptoms [170]. You may need to\nuse it on yourself [170].\nMiscellaneous Drugs include various classifications [171].\nCardiac medicines: Accidental or intentional overdose [171]. Children may\nthink they are candy; older adults may forget doses [171]. Symptoms vary\nby medication [172]. Contact poison control ASAP [172].\nAspirin: Ingesting too much can cause nausea, vomiting, hyperventilation,\nringing in ears [173]. Patients may have anxiety, confusion, tachypnea,\nhyperthermia, and be in danger of seizures [174].\nAcetaminophen: Overdose is common and serious, whether accidental or\nintentional [175].\nAlcohols (methyl or ethyl glycol) are more toxic than drinking alcohol [175].\nThey cause severe tachypnea, blindness, renal failure, and potentially\ndeath [175].\nFood Poisoning: Caused by bacteria or toxins [176].\nSalmonella bacterium causes severe GI symptoms (nausea, vomiting,\nabdominal pain, diarrhea) within 72 hours [176]. Proper cooking and\nkitchen cleanliness prevent it [178].\nStaphylococcus bacteria grow quickly in unrefrigerated leftovers and\nproduce toxins [179]. Symptoms start suddenly (nausea, vomiting,\ndiarrhea) within 2-12 hours [181].\nBotulism is the most severe form, resulting from improperly canned\nfood [182]. Bacterial spores grow and produce a toxin [184]. Symptoms\nare neurologic: blurred vision, weakness, difficulty speaking/breathing\n[185]. It can be fatal; symptoms develop within 24 hours to 4 days [186].\nDo not try to determine the specific food poisoning cause in acute\ncases [187]. Gather history and transport promptly [187]. Take suspected\nfood if multiple people are ill [188].\nPlant Poisonings: Tens of thousands of cases annually [189]. Many\nhousehold plants are poisonous [190].\nEffects vary: local skin irritation, effects on circulatory/GI/CNS systems\n[191].\nImpossible to memorize all poisonous plants and effects [192].\nAssess airway and vital signs [193]. Notify poison control for plant\nidentification assistance [193]. Take the plant with you to the hospital\n[193].\nType Key Characteristics/Effects Management Highlights\nAlcohol CNS depressant,\nsedative/hypnotic; dulled\nsenses, slowed reflexes, lack\nof coordination; withdrawal\n(DTs)\nRespiratory support if\nneeded; reassure patient\nduring withdrawal, provide\ncare and support [92]\nOpiates CNS depressant; severe\nrespiratory depression,\npinpoint pupils, sedation;\ntolerance develops quickly\nNaloxone (Narcan) to reverse\neffects, especially for\nrespiratory depression [105]\nSedative-\nHypnotics\nCNS depressant; alter\nconsciousness,\ndrowsy/intoxicated state;\ntolerance develops quickly\nEnsure patent airway, assist\nventilations, prompt\ntransport [118]\nAbused Inhalants Inhaled; drowsiness to coma,\nseizures; heart\nhypersensitive to adrenaline\n(hydrocarbons); rotten egg\nsmell (hydrogen sulfide)\nKeep patients calm, provide\noxygen, transport [123].

Case Studies and Review Questions\nUnderstanding key questions for poisoning assessment is important [198].\nAsking why a patient intentionally overdosed is the least pertinent EMT\nquestion [198].\nIf a patient vomits after ingesting a substance, collect the vomit to bring to the\nhospital and look for pill fragments [200].\nWhen caring for a surface contact poisoning, the first priority is to avoid\ncontaminating yourself [204].\nMost poisonings occur via ingestion, accounting for about 80% of cases [205].\nactivated charcoal dosage is calculated based on patient weight in kilograms\n[206]. The dose is one gram per kilogram [206]. To convert pounds to kilograms,\ndivide by 2.2 [206]. A 55-pound child needs about 25 grams [206].\nWhen a person needs increasing amounts of a substance to achieve the same\neffect over time, this is called developing tolerance [210].\nBinge drinking does not increase a sense of awareness; it typically causes a\ndull sense of awareness [213].\nAn unconscious patient with slow and shallow respirations, slow/weak pulse,\nand constricted (pinpoint) pupils is consistent with an opioid overdose [215].\nThis patient would likely need naloxone [217].\nThe mnemonic \"DUMBELS\" helps recall the signs and symptoms of a\ncholinergic drug overdose [218]. The \"E\" in DUMBELS stands for emesis\n(vomiting) [218].\nFood poisoning is almost always caused by eating foods containing bacteria,\nsuch as salmonella [218].",

Introduction to Behavioral Health Emergencies\nCommon Causes of Behavioral Crises\nAcute medical situation [6]\nMental illness [6]\nMind-altering substance [6]\nStress [6]\nOther causes [6]\nThis report covers behavioral health emergencies for EMTs [1].\nEMTs will learn to recognize behaviors that pose a risk [2].\nThis includes risks to the EMT, patient, and others [2].\nBasic principles of the mental health system are also discussed [2].\nEMTs often care for patients experiencing behavioral crisis emergencies [5].\nThese crises can result from acute medical situations, mental illness, mindaltering\nsubstances, or stress [6].\nBehavior is defined as a person\u0027s response to the environment over time [19].\nNormal coping mechanisms may not be enough during great stress [20].\nNegative coping mechanisms like withdrawing or using drugs and alcohol may\nbe used [20].\nReactions to stress can create a crisis [21].\nA change in behavior may be considered inappropriate [22].\nA behavioral crisis includes patients of all ages [23].\nPatients may exhibit agitated, violent, or uncooperative behavior [23].\nThey may also be a danger to themselves or others [23].\nEMS is called when behavior becomes unacceptable [24].\n2. Understanding Mental Health Disorders and Crises\nMost people experience an emotional crisis at some point [7].\nThis does not mean everyone develops a mental illness [7].\nOtherwise healthy people can have temporary mental health disorders [8].\nDo not assume a patient is mentally ill [9].\nFeeling bad or depressed doesn\u0027t mean you are sick [10].\nThere are justifiable reasons for depression [11].\nExamples include divorce, job loss, or death of a loved one [11].\nThis is a normal reaction to an acute crisis [12].\nIt is a misconception that all individuals with mental health disorders are\ndangerous [13].\nOnly a small percentage of people with mental health problems are violent [14].\nEMTs may see more violent patients [15].\nThis is because they are seeing patients in a behavioral crisis [15].\nMental health disorders are common in the United States [28].\nThey affect tens of millions of people each year [28].\nA psychiatric disorder has psychological or behavioral symptoms [29].\nThis may result in impaired functioning [29].\nAnxiety disorders are among the most common mental health disorders [30].\nThese include generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and phobias [31].\nPost-traumatic stress disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder are also\ncommon [32].\n3. Underlying Causes and Pathophysiology\nOrganic Disorders Functional Disorders\nPhysical condition [43] Psychological condition [43]\nTemporary or permanent brain dysfunction [45] Impair body function when\nstructurally normal [49]\nCaused by disturbance in brain tissue\nfunctioning [45]\nInclude schizophrenia, some\nanxiety conditions, and\ndepression [50]\nCauses: sudden illness, TBI, seizure disorder,\ndrug/alcohol abuse, overdose, withdrawal,\nAlzheimer\u0027s, meningitis [46]\nAltered mental status from: hypoglycemia,\nhypoxia, impaired cerebral blood flow,\nhyperthermia, hypothermia [47]\nBehavioral health disorders have many underlying causes [36].\nThese can include social or situational stress [37].\nExamples are divorce or death of a loved one [37].\nDiseases like schizophrenia can be a cause [38].\nPhysical illnesses such as a diabetic emergency can also contribute [38].\nChemical problems like alcohol or drug use are causes [38].\nBiological disturbances such as electrolyte imbalance can be involved [38].\nThese conditions can be compounded by not taking prescribed medications\n[39].\nEMTs are not responsible for diagnosing the underlying cause [41].\nThey should understand organic and functional diagnoses [42].\nAn organic disorder is a physical condition [43].\nA functional disorder is a psychological condition [43].\norganic brain syndrome is brain dysfunction [45].\nIt can be temporary or permanent [45].\nCauses include sudden illness, traumatic brain injury, or seizure disorder\n[46].\nDrug and alcohol abuse or withdrawal can cause it [46].\nDiseases like Alzheimer\u0027s and meningitis are causes [46].\nAltered mental status can come from hypoglycemia or hypoxia [47].\nImpaired cerebral blood flow can also cause it [47].\nhyperthermia or hypothermia can alter mental status [47].\nfunctional disorders impair body function [49].\nThe body seems structurally normal in functional disorders [49].\nExamples include schizophrenia and depression [50].\n4. Patient Assessment in Behavioral Health Emergencies\nA safe approach is crucial for behavioral crises [50].\nPatient assessment begins with the scene size-up [51].\nScene safety is the first consideration [51].\nAssess the patient\u0027s response to the environment [51].\nDetermine if the situation is dangerous for you and your partner [51].\nImmediate law enforcement backup may be needed [51].\nYou might need to stage until law enforcement secures the scene [51].\nNote any medications or substances the patient is taking [53].\nThis could contribute to the complaint or be a treatment [53].\nForm a general impression during the primary assessment [54].\nBegin assessment from a safe distance, like the doorway [54].\nPerform a rapid physical exam [54].\nObserve the patient closely [54].\nUse the AVPU scale to check for alertness [54].\nEstablish a rapport with the patient [55].\nAssess the airway to ensure it is open and adequate [55].\nEvaluate the patient\u0027s breathing rate and effort [56].\nUse pulse oximetry if available [57].\nProvide appropriate interventions based on findings [57].\nAssess the pulse rate, rhythm, and quality [58].\nEvaluate for shock and bleeding [59].\nAssess the patient\u0027s perfusion [59].\nEvaluate skin color, temperature, and capillary refill [60].\nSpend time with the patient if medically stable [61].\nTake a SAMPLE history for a medical patient [62].\nConsider factors like central nervous system function [62].\nHallucinogens, drugs, or alcohol might be factors [62].\nSignificant life changes or illness could be non-physical [62].\nAsk about a history of behavioral health illness [62].\nIn geriatric patients, consider Alzheimer\u0027s and dementia [63].\nIdentify the patient\u0027s baseline mental status [64].\nUse reflective listening to understand the patient\u0027s thinking [65].\nReflective listening involves repeating what the patient tells you [176].\n5. Management and Intervention Strategies\nDe-escalation Techniques\nEstablish a level of trust [17]\nBe a good listener [79]\nUse verbal de-escalation before physical restraint [115]\nCommunication is the key in behavioral health emergencies [16].\nIn some cases, patients will de-escalate [17].\nThis happens when a level of trust is established [17].\nYou cannot determine the cause of the crisis [17].\nHowever, you may predict potential for violence [17].\nThe best treatment may be to be a good listener [79].\nIntervene only as much as needed to accomplish tasks [79].\nIf pharmacological restraint might be necessary, request advanced life\nsupport early [79].\nDiffuse and control the situation [78].\n6. Specific Behavioral Health Conditions\nPsychosis is a state of delusion [83].\nThe person is out of touch with reality [83].\nAffected people live in their own reality [83].\nCauses of psychotic episodes include altered mind-altering substances [83].\nIntense stress or delusional disorders can cause psychosis [83].\nschizophrenia is also a cause of psychosis [83].\nschizophrenia is a complex disorder [84].\nIt is not easily defined or treated [84].\nOnset typically occurs during early adulthood [85].\nSymptoms become more prominent over time [85].\nContributing influences include brain damage and genetics [86].\nPhysiologic and social influences also contribute [86].\nSymptoms are delusions, hallucinations, and lack of pleasure [87].\nErratic speech is also a symptom [87].\nWhen dealing with schizophrenia, determine if the situation is safe [87].\nClearly identify yourself [88].\nBe calm, direct, and straightforward [88].\nMaintain an emotional distance [88].\nDo not argue with the patient [89].\nExplain what you are going to do [89].\nInvolve people the patient trusts, like family [89].\nThis helps gain the patient\u0027s cooperation [89].\nexcited delirium is also known as agitated delirium [90].\nIt can also be called exhaustive mania [90].\nDelirium is an impairment in cognitive function [91].\nIt can present with disorientation, hallucinations, or delusions [91].\nAgitation is characterized by restlessness [92].\nIrregular physical activity is a sign of agitation [92].\nSymptoms of excited delirium include hyperactive, irrational behavior [93].\nVivid hallucinations are a symptom [93].\nHypertension, tachycardia, and diaphoresis can occur [93].\nDilated pupils are also a symptom [93].\nIf safe to approach, be calm, supportive, and empathetic [94].\nApproach the patient slowly and purposefully [95].\nRespect the patient\u0027s personal space [95].\nLimit physical contact as much as possible [96].\nDo not leave the patient unattended [96].\nUse careful interviewing to assess cognitive functioning [97].\nDetermine the patient\u0027s ability to communicate [98].\nObserve the patient\u0027s appearance, dress, and hygiene [99].\nIf overdose is suspected, take medicine bottles with you [100].\nTransport to a hospital with a behavioral health facility [101].\nRefrain from using lights and sirens [101].\nIf agitation continues, request advanced life support [102].\nchemical restraints can be considered [102].\nexcited delirium can lead to sudden death from cardiac arrest [103].\nThis is thought to result from metabolic acidosis [103].\nPhysical control measures include tasers and stimulant drugs [104].\npositional asphyxia is also a risk [104].\n7. Patient Restraints: Considerations and Procedures\nRisks of Improper Restraint\nPositional asphyxia [111]\nAspiration [111]\nSevere acidosis [111]\nCardiac arrest [111]\nPre-hospital patient restraints reduce injury possibility [104].\nThis protects the patient and EMS providers [104].\nRestraints allow for safe treatment of uncooperative patients [105].\nA pre-hospital patient restraint protocol should be followed [106].\nThe protocol should address appropriateness and types of restraint [107].\nCare provided after restraint should be in the protocol [107].\nProtocols must consider state laws [108].\nOnly approved restraint devices should be used [109].\nThe least restrictive method ensuring safety should be chosen [110].\nThere are risks associated with restraints [111].\nImproper use can lead to life-threatening conditions [111].\nThese include positional asphyxia, aspiration, and severe acidosis [111].\nCardiac arrest is also a possibility [111].\nRestraining without authority can result in legal actions [112].\nExamples are assault, battery, or false imprisonment [112].\nViolation of civil rights is also a risk [112].\nRestraints are only to protect yourself and others from bodily harm [113].\nThey prevent the patient from injuring themselves [113].\nInvolve law enforcement for severe behavioral crises [114].\nUse verbal de-escalation before physical restraint [115].\nOnce the decision to restrain is made, do it quickly [116].\nIdeally, five people should be present for restraint [117].\nOne person for each extremity and one for the head is ideal [118].\nA team leader should direct the process [119].\nUse the minimum force necessary [119].\nForce level depends on factors like patient size and strength [121].\nThe type of abnormal behavior also affects force needed [122].\nTalk to the patient throughout the process [123].\nTreat the patient with dignity and respect [124].\nA provider of the same gender should tend the patient if possible [124].\nWear appropriate barrier protection [125].\nAvoid direct eye contact until necessary [125].\nRespect the patient\u0027s personal space [125].\nNever leave a restrained patient unattended [126].\nfour-point restraints are preferred for uncooperative patients [126].\nThis means both arms and legs are restrained [126].\nRespiratory and circulatory problems can occur in restrained patients [127].\nRestraints should not be removed until evaluated at the hospital [128].\nFollow skill drills for four-point restraint [129].\ntwo-point restraint is an option if allowed by protocol [130].\nReassess and document respiration, pulse, motor, and sensory functions [77].\nDo this every five minutes in restrained extremities [77].\n8. Assessing Potential for Violence and Suicide Risk\nViolent patients are a small percentage of behavioral crises [131].\nAssess the danger level based on risk factors [132].\nHistory is a risk factor for violence [132].\nHas the patient been hostile or violent before? [132].\nPosture can indicate danger [132].\nIs the patient tense, rigid, or sitting on edge? [132].\nThe scene provides clues [132].\nIs the patient near potentially lethal objects like a knife or gun? [132].\nVocal activity is a factor [132].\nIs speech loud, obscene, erratic, or bizarre? [132].\nErratic speech patterns usually indicate emotional distress [132].\nPhysical activity may be the most telling factor [132].\nA patient requiring watching has tense muscles or clenched fists [133].\nPacing or inability to sit still are signs [133].\nFiercely protecting personal space is a sign [133].\nPoor muscle impulse control is a risk factor [133].\nA history of fighting or uncontrollable temper is a risk [134].\nSubstance abuse history increases risk [134].\nDepression accounts for 20 percent of violent acts [134].\nA functional disorder can increase risk [134].\nIf a patient hears voices telling them to kill, believe them [135].\nDepression is the most significant factor contributing to suicide [136].\nIt\u0027s a misconception that those who threaten suicide won\u0027t commit it [137].\nThreatening suicide means someone is in crisis [138].\nThey cannot handle it alone [138].\nImmediate intervention is necessary for suicidal patients [138].\nWarning signs include sadness, despair, and hopelessness [139].\nAppearing detached is a sign [139].\nInability to talk about the future is a sign [139].\nSuggestions of suicide are warning signs [139].\nSpecific plans for suicide or death are major warnings [139].\nAdditional risk factors for suicide include unsafe objects nearby [141].\nAn unsafe environment is a risk [141].\nEvidence of self-destructive behavior is a risk [141].\nAn immediate threat to the patient or others is a risk [141].\nAn underlying medical problem can increase risk [141].\nCultural, religious, and social beliefs promoting suicide are risks [141].\nTrauma can increase suicide risk [141].\nA suicidal patient may also be homicidal [141].\n9. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) in Combat Veterans\nSigns and Symptoms of PTSD\nHelplessness [148]\nAnxiety, anger, or fear [148]\nAvoiding reminders of the trauma [148]\nConstant nervous system arousal [148]\nIncreased heart rate [149]\nDilated pupils [149]\nIncreased systolic blood pressure [149]\nSharpened senses [150]\nHeightened mental acuity [150]\nReliving trauma through thoughts, nightmares, or flashbacks [151]\nAlcohol and drug use [152]\nIncreased risk of suicide [153]\nPhysical conditions related to injuries [153]\nUnfocused pain [153]\nHigher incidence of TBI [154]\nPTSD can occur after trauma exposure or injury [143].\nExamples include sexual or physical assault [144].\nChild abuse or serious accidents are also causes [144].\nNatural disasters, war, or loss of a loved one can cause PTSD [144].\nA stressful life event can lead to PTSD [144].\nPTSD is not always from a single recent event [145].\nEstimated 7-8% of the general population experience PTSD [146].\nMilitary personnel in combat have a high incidence of PTSD [147].\nSigns include helplessness, anxiety, anger, or fear [148].\nThey frequently avoid trauma reminders [148].\nThey suffer constant nervous system arousal [148].\nHeart rate and systolic blood pressure increase [149].\nPupils dilate [149].\nSenses are sharpened and mental acuity heightened [150].\nThey often relive the trauma through flashbacks [151].\nPTSD occurs when trying to escape internal distress [152].\nAlcohol and drug use are common among veterans [152].\nVeterans have an increased risk of suicide [153].\nThey may develop physical conditions related to combat injuries [153].\nUnfocused pain not tied to a body part is possible [153].\nCombat veterans have a higher incidence of TBI [154].\nTBI is often from IED explosions [154].\nEliminate excess noise when caring for veterans [155].\nRefrain from touching or doing anything without explanation [155].\nKeep diesel equipment far away if possible [155].\nReturning vets require understanding and compassion [156].\nThey need specialized attention [156].\nBe careful how you phrase questions [157].\nUse a calm tone but be in charge [157].\nRespect a veteran\u0027s personal space [157].\nLimit the number of people involved [157].\nMove to a private and quiet space if possible [157].\nAsk about suicidal intentions [157].\nMilitary personnel are trained with weapons [158].\nThey are resourceful in improvising weapons [158].\nEnsure no accessible objects can be used as weapons [159].\nPhysical restraint is ineffective with this population [160].\nIt may simply escalate the problem [160].\n10. Medical-Legal Considerations\nMedical-legal aspects are complicated in behavioral emergencies [161].\nIf a patient has impaired mental capacity, decide if they need emergency care\n[162].\nA mentally unstable patient may resist care [163].\nDo not leave this patient alone [163].\nRequest law enforcement to handle the patient [164].\nYou need consent to provide care [165].\nimplied consent is assumed if the patient is not mentally competent [165].\nConsent matters are not always clear-cut [165].\nIf unsure, request law enforcement assistance [166].\nGuidance from medical control is also helpful [166].\nEMTs have limited legal authority to force care [167].\nThis is true when no life-threatening emergency exists [167].\nA competent adult can refuse treatment [168].\nThis is true even if life-saving care is involved [168].\nIn psychiatric cases, providing life-saving care is likely considered appropriate\n[169].\nAn impaired patient may not be competent to refuse treatment [170].\nAlways maintain a high index of suspicion [171].\nAssume the worst and hope for the best [171].\nError on the side of treatment and transport [171].\nCarefully document patient statements and behaviors [171].\nThis supports your actions [171].",

[1]\nAfter this chapter, you will understand the female reproductive system. [2]\nYou will also identify and describe assessment and treatment for gynecologic\nemergencies. [2]\nSpecial considerations for sexual assault cases are also discussed. [3]\n2. Anatomy and Physiology of the Female Reproductive System\nStructure Location/Description Function\nExternal\nGenitalia\nVaginal opening, labia, clitoris,\nperineum\n[5]\nOvaries Each side of the lower abdomen Produce an ovum (egg)\n[6]\nFallopian tubes Connect each ovary to the uterus Fertilization occurs\nhere [15]\nUterus Muscular organ Fetus grows here\nduring pregnancy [8]\nCervix Narrowest part of the uterus, opens\ninto the vagina\n[8]\nVagina Outermost cavity of the reproductive\nsystem\n[9]\nMenarche Onset of menstruation, typically ages\n11-16\nIndicates capability of\npregnancy [11]\nMenopause End of menstrual activity, usually\naround 50 years old\n[12]\nOvulation Release of one ovum into the fallopian\ntubes each month\n[13]\nFertilization Begins in the vagina, sperm travels to\nfallopian tubes\nEmbryo travels to\nuterus and grows [14]\nMenstruation Occurs if fertilization does not happen\nwithin 14 days of ovulation\nUterine lining\nseparates [16]\nFemale\nHormones\nProduced primarily in the ovaries Control ovulation and\nmenstruation [17]\n3. Common Gynecologic Emergencies: Pathophysiology and\nSymptoms\nCondition Pathophysiology Common Symptoms Risk Factors\nPelvic\nInflammatory\nDisease (PID)\nInfection of upper\nreproductive organs\n(fallopian tubes,\novaries) [20]\nGeneralized lower\nabdominal pain [23],\nabnormal or foulsmelling\nvaginal\ndischarge [24],\nincreased pain with\nintercourse [24], fever\n[24], general malaise\nMultiple sexual\npartners [25],\nuntreated STDs\n[26], history of\nPID [26],\nsexually active\nunder 26 [26],\n[24], nausea and\nvomiting [24]\ndouching [26],\nIUD use [26]\nSexually\nTransmitted\nDiseases\n(STDs)\nInfections spread\nthrough sexual\ncontact [27]\nCan be mild or absent\n[30], can lead to PID [28]\n, premature birth or low\nbirth weight (Bacterial\nVaginosis) [33],\nsusceptible to other\ninfections (Bacterial\nVaginosis) [33],\ncramping [35],\nabdominal pain [35],\nnausea [35], vomiting\n[35], bleeding between\nperiods (Gonorrhea)\n[35], spread to other\nbody parts (Gonorrhea\nuntreated) [36]\nMultiple sexual\npartners [25],\nuntreated STDs\n[26]\n- Chlamydia Most common STD\nin the US [29],\ninfection of cervix\ncan spread to rectum\nand progress to PID\n[31]\nUsually milder, absent\nsymptoms [30]\n- Bacterial\nVaginosis\nMost common\ninfection for women\naged 15-44 [32]\nUntreated can lead to\npremature birth or low\nbirth weight in\npregnancy [33], makes\npatient more\nsusceptible to other\ninfections [33], can\ncause PID [33]\n- Gonorrhea Caused by bacteria\nthat grow in warm,\nmoist areas of\nreproductive tract\n[34]\nSevere infections\npresent with cramping,\nabdominal pain,\nnausea, vomiting, and\nbleeding between\nperiods [35]\nVaginal\nBleeding\nCauses include\nabnormal\nmenstruation, vaginal\ntrauma, ectopic\npregnancy,\nspontaneous\nabortion, polyps, or\ncancer [38]\nVisible bleeding [57],\nquality and quantity\nimportant to note [60]\n4. Patient Assessment in Gynecologic Emergencies\nObtaining an accurate and detailed assessment is critical. [40]\nScene safety is the first step. [42]\nAsk about assistance needed and number of patients. [42]\nDetermine the nature of the illness. [42]\nTake standard precautions, as large amounts of blood and body fluids may be\npresent. [42]\nDocument accurately, especially if it\u0027s a crime scene. [44]\nInvolve the police if assault is suspected. [45]\nA female EMT should provide care in sexual assault cases if possible. [45]\nThe primary assessment includes forming a general impression. [47]\nUse the AVPU scale for level of consciousness. [47]\nEvaluate airway and breathing immediately. [48]\nPalpate pulse and evaluate skin color, temperature, and moisture to identify\nblood loss. [49]\nMost gynecologic emergencies are not life-threatening. [50]\nIf signs of shock are present, transport is warranted. [51]\nHistory taking involves investigating the chief complaint. [52]\nBe sensitive as questions may be personal. [52]\nProtect the patient\u0027s privacy and dignity. [52]\nFor abdominal pain, use OPQRST. [53]\nAsk about associated symptoms like syncope, nausea, vomiting, or fever. [54]\nFor vaginal bleeding, follow OPQRST with SAMPLE history. [54]\nAsk about birth control, medical conditions, and last menstrual period. [54]\nThe secondary assessment focuses on the chief complaint area. [56]\nCheck vital signs. [57]\nAssess the abdomen for distension or tenderness. [57]\nNote visible bleeding and mental status. [57]\nPhysical exams should be limited and professional. [58]\nOnly examine genitalia if necessary for treatment. [58]\nFor vaginal bleeding, visualize the bleeding. [60]\nAsk about the quality and quantity of bleeding. [60]\nObserve for vaginal discharge. [60]\nFever, nausea, and vomiting are significant in gynecologic emergencies. [61]\nSyncope is also significant and treat as if in shock. [61]\nVital signs include heart rate, respiratory rate, skin condition, cap refill, and\nblood pressure. [62]\nConsider orthostatic vital signs if bleeding is known or suspected. [62]\n5. Emergency Care and Special Considerations\nPrinciple Description\nMaintain Privacy Get the patient to a private location if possible.\n[63]\nFemale EMT Participation Have a female EMT participate in patient care if\npossible. [63]\nManaging Vaginal Bleeding Use sanitary pads on external genitalia to absorb\nblood. [64]\nDocument the number of saturated pads. [65]\nTreat external lacerations, abrasions, or tears\nwith sterile compresses. [66]\nNever pack or place dressings in the vagina.\n[67]\nAssessment and\nManagement of PID\nPatient will complain of abdominal pain. [68]\nPain usually starts during or after menstruation.\n[69]\nPain may be worse with walking, causing a\nshuffling gait. [70]\nPrehospital treatment is limited. [71]\nNon-emergency transport is usually\nrecommended. [71]\nConsiderations for Sexual\nAssault Victims\nSexual assault and rape are common in the US.\n[72]\nEMTs face medical, psychological, and legal\nissues. [73]\nProfessionalism, tact, kindness, and sensitivity\nare important. [74]\nBe aware of drugs used to incapacitate a person.\n[75]\nOffer the patient the option of being treated by a\nfemale EMT. [76]\nFocus on medical treatment, psychological care,\nand evidence preservation. [77]\nPersuade the patient not to clean themselves if\npossible. [78]\nOffer to call the local Rape Crisis Center.

Transport Decisions and Trauma Center Levels A\n1. Introduction to Trauma and Energy Concepts\nTraumatic injuries are the leading cause of death for people younger than 44 years\nold in the United States [6]. Trauma emergencies happen because of physical forces\non the body [7]. Understanding the mechanism of injury (MOI) helps predict serious\nunseen injuries [7]. This awareness is called index of suspicion [7].\nTraumatic injury happens when body tissues are exposed to energy beyond their\ntolerance [9]. MOI describes the forces causing the injury [10]. Three key energy\nconcepts related to injury are potential energy, kinetic energy, and work [11]. Energy\ncannot be created or destroyed, only changed [13].\nWork is force over distance [13]. Forces that bend or compress tissues cause\ninjury [14].\nkinetic energy is the energy of a moving object [14]. It relates to the object\u0027s\nmass (weight) and velocity (speed) [15].\npotential energy is related to the mass and gravity [15]. It\u0027s mostly linked to\nfalling objects [15].\nEnergy Type Description Relation to Injury\nPotential\nEnergy\nEnergy of falling\nobjects\nProduct of mass, gravity, and weight [15]\nKinetic Energy Energy of a moving\nobject\nRelationship between mass and\nvelocity [15]\nWork Force acting over\ndistance\nBending or compressing tissues causes\ninjury [13]\n2. Mechanisms of Injury: Blunt and Penetrating Trauma\nTraumatic injuries are categorized as blunt trauma or penetrating trauma [18].\nblunt trauma is caused by force without penetrating tissues or organs [18].\nCommon examples include motor vehicle crashes and falls [22]. Skin\ndiscoloration and pain might be the only signs [23]. It\u0027s important to have a\nhigh index of suspicion for hidden injuries [7].\npenetrating trauma occurs when objects pierce the body\u0027s surface [19]. This\ndamages soft tissues, internal organs, and body cavities [19].\nBoth types can happen from various MOIs [20].\nTrauma\nType\nCharacteristics Common\nMechanisms\nAssessment Clues\nBlunt Trauma Force without\npenetrating tissues or\norgans [18]\nMotor vehicle\ncrashes, falls [22]\nSkin discoloration,\npain, unseen injuries\n[23]\nPenetrating\nTrauma\nObjects pierce or\npenetrate body\nsurface [19]\nKnives, bullets\n[67]\nEntrance/Exit\nwounds, trajectory,\ncavitation [70]\n3. Motor Vehicle Crash Mechanisms and Associated Injuries\nA motor vehicle crash typically involves three collisions [23]. The vehicle\u0027s condition\ncan indicate the MOI [24].\nFirst collision: Vehicle against an object (e.g., a tree) [23].\nSecond collision: Passenger against the car\u0027s interior [24]. kinetic energy is\nconverted to work of stopping the body [24]. Common injuries include lower\nextremity fractures, rib fractures, and head trauma [25].\nThird collision: Passenger\u0027s internal organs against body structures [26].\nInternal injuries may be life-threatening but not obvious externally [26].\nSignificant MOIs in crashes include:\nDeath of an occupant [27].\nSevere vehicle deformity or intrusion [27].\nModerate lateral intrusion or severe rear damage [27].\nCrashes with rotation involved [27].\nEjection from the vehicle [27].\nDifferent crash types cause specific injury patterns:\nFrontal crashes: Evaluate restraint systems and airbag deployment [28]. Seat\nbelts and airbags prevent the second collision\u0027s severity [29]. Airbags\ndecrease deceleration injuries to chest, face, and head [30]. Suspect extremity\nand internal organ injuries despite airbags [31]. Improper restraints can cause\ninjuries; seat belts too low cause hip dislocations, too high cause internal\ninjuries, and lumbar spine fractures are possible [33].\nRear-end crashes: Known for whiplash injuries, especially without a proper\nheadrest [36]. Acceleration injury to the brain is possible [38]. Rear passengers\nwith only a lap belt may injure the thoracic and lumbar spine [38].\nLateral crashes: Common cause of death [40]. Vehicle rocks away from the\nimpact side [41]. Passenger sustains a whiplash-type injury [41]. Substantial\nintrusion suggests lateral chest and abdominal injuries, lower extremity and\npelvis fractures, or rib fractures and organ damage [42].\nRollover crashes: Large trucks and SUVs are prone due to high center of\ngravity [43]. Injuries depend on restraint use [44]. Ejection is the most common\nlife-threatening event [45]. Severe injuries can occur even when restrained [46].\nRotational crashes (spins): Similar to rollovers [47]. Vehicle spinning can\nstrike objects like utility poles [48].\nCrash\nType\nMechanism Common Injuries\nFrontal Vehicle strikes\nobject head-on\nLower extremity fractures, ribs, head trauma\n(passenger vs interior) [25], extremity/internal\norgan injuries (despite airbags) [31]\nRear-end Vehicle struck\nfrom behind\nWhiplash, acceleration brain injury [36],\nthoracic/lumbar spine injury (lap belt only) [38]\nLateral Vehicle struck\nfrom the side\nWhiplash, lateral chest/abdominal injuries, lower\nextremity/pelvis fractures, rib/organ damage [41]\nRollover Vehicle rolls over Ejection (most common life-threat) [45], severe\ninjuries even when restrained [46]\nRotational Vehicle spins Injuries from striking objects during spin [48]\n4. Other Blunt Trauma Mechanisms: Pedestrian, Bicycle,\nMotorcycle, and Falls\nOther blunt trauma mechanisms also cause significant injuries.\nCar versus Pedestrian: Injuries are often graphic and obvious [49]. Serious\nunseen injuries are also possible [49]. Key factors include vehicle speed, if the\npatient was thrown and how far, where they landed, and if they were pulled\nunder the vehicle [50]. Evaluate the striking vehicle for damage [51]. ALS should\nbe called for significant MOI [52].\nCar versus Bicycle: Evaluate similarly to car versus pedestrian crashes [53].\nAssess bicycle damage and position [53]. Inspect the helmet for damage [53].\nPresume spinal cord injury until ruled out at the hospital [53]. Spinal\nimmobilization is crucial [53].\nCar versus Motorcycle: Helmets offer protection but not against severe\ncervical injury [54]. Leather or abrasion-resistant clothing protects against\nroad abrasion but not blunt trauma [55]. Boots protect feet [55]. When\nassessing, look for motorcycle deformity, side of most damage, skid distance,\ndamage to other objects, and helmet deformity [56]. There are four types of\nmotorcycle impacts:\nHead-on: Motorcycle stops, rider continues forward [57].\nAngular: Motorcycle strikes object at an angle; rider\u0027s lower extremity is\ncrushed [58].\nEjection: Rider travels at high speed until stopped by an object or road\ndrag [59].\nControlled crash: Rider separates from the motorcycle before impact\n(laying the bike down) [60].\nFalls: Injury potential relates to the fall height [62]. Greater height means\ngreater potential energy [62]. A fall over 20 feet is significant [63]. Internal\ninjuries are the greatest threat [63]. Landing on feet may lessen internal\ninjuries but cause serious lower extremity and pelvis injuries [64]. Spinal\ninjuries are possible [64]. Consider fall height, surface struck, body part that\nhit first, and energy displacement path [64].\n5. Penetrating Trauma: Low, Medium, and High Velocity\npenetrating trauma is the second leading cause of death after blunt trauma [66]. It\ncan be caused by low, medium, or high energy impacts.\nLow energy penetrating trauma: Caused by objects like knives or ice picks\n[67]. Injuries are from sharp edges moving through tissue, close to the object\u0027s\npath [68]. Knives moved internally can cause more damage than external\nwounds suggest [69].\nMedium and high velocity penetrating trauma: Usually caused by bullets [70]\n. The bullet\u0027s path can be unpredictable; it may flatten, tumble, or ricochet [71].\nThe path is called the trajectory [72]. Fragmentation increases damage [72].\ncavitation results from rapid tissue/fluid pressure changes [72].\nTemporary cavitation: Tissue stretching from pressure changes [73].\nPermanent cavitation: Injury closer to the bullet path that remains after\npassage [73].\nThe distance and injury severity depend on the weapon type [74]. Air resistance\n(drag) slows the projectile, reducing penetration depth and energy [75]. The damaged\narea from medium/high velocity projectiles is much larger than the projectile\u0027s\ndiameter [76]. Exit wounds are often larger than entrance wounds for this reason [77].\nEnergy\u0027s ability to cause damage is more about speed than mass [78]. The type of\ntissue the projectile passes through significantly impacts injury seriousness [79].\nVelocity Characteristics Damage Mechanism\nLow Velocity Objects like knives or\nice picks [67]\nSharp edges moving through tissue\n[68]\nMedium/High\nVelocity\nUsually bullets [70] Trajectory, fragmentation, cavitation\n(temporary and permanent) [72]\n6. Blast Injuries: Mechanisms and Affected Tissues\nBlast injuries are seen in civilian settings from explosions in mines, shipyards,\nchemical plants, and terrorist activities [81]. There are four mechanisms of blast\ninjuries [82].\nPrimary blast injuries: Caused entirely by the blast\u0027s pressure wave [83].\nSecondary blast injuries: Damage from flying debris hitting the body [84].\ntertiary blast injuries: Victim is thrown by the explosion force against a\nstationary object [85].\nQuaternary blast injuries: Burns from hot gases, respiratory injury from toxic\ngas, crush injury from building collapse, suffocation, poisoning, or other\nmedical emergencies/contamination [86].\nMost survivors have a combination of these four injury types [88]. Tissues containing\nair are most susceptible to pressure changes, like the middle ear, lungs, and GI tract\n[89].\nThe ear is the most sensitive [90].\npulmonary blasts are lung trauma from close exposure to detonations [91].\npneumothorax is common and may need field decompression [92]. arterial\nair emboli are concerning pulmonary blast injuries, occurring when air enters\nlung blood vessels, potentially causing vision issues, behavioral changes,\nconsciousness changes, or neurological signs [93].\nSolid organs are somewhat protected but can be injured by secondary\nmissiles or being thrown [94].\nNeurologic injuries and head trauma are the most common causes of death\nfrom blast injuries [94]. Extremity injuries, including traumatic amputations,\nare also frequent [95].\nBlast\nMechanism\nDescription Example Injuries\nPrimary Pressure wave from\nexplosion [83]\nEar damage, pulmonary blast\ninjuries [90]\nSecondary Struck by flying debris [84] Penetrating wounds, fractures\n[84]\nTertiary Victim is thrown against\nobject [85]\nFractures, head trauma, internal\ninjuries [85]\nQuaternary Burns, toxic inhalation, crush\ninjury, etc. [86]\nBurns, respiratory issues,\nsuffocation, poisoning [86]\n7. Multi-System Trauma and Pre-hospital Care Principles\nmulti-system trauma involves injury to more than one body system [96]. Examples\ninclude head/spine trauma, chest/abdomen injuries, or chest/multiple extremity\ninjuries [97]. Patients with multi-system trauma have high morbidity and mortality [98].\nRapid transport and medical control contact are important [97].\nThe golden principles of pre-hospital trauma care guide management [98]:\nEnsure safety: Your safety first, then crew safety, then patient safety [98].\nDetermine the need for additional personnel and equipment [100].\nEvaluate the mechanism of injury [100].\nIdentify and manage life threats [101].\nFocus on patient care [101].\nHemorrhage control is the highest priority [101].\nAccess and manage the airway, including ventilatory support and highflow\noxygen [102]. Maintain spinal restriction [102]. This is the second priority\n[102].\nEnsure other shock therapy is completed [102].\nProtect the spine and proceed with spinal immobilization if indicated [102].\nTransport the patient immediately to the appropriate facility [103]. Definitive\ncare for multi-system trauma often requires surgery [104]. Scene time should\nbe 10 minutes or less [104].\nDuring transport, obtain a SAMPLE history and complete the secondary\nassessment [105].\nConsider advanced life support (ALS) intercept or air medical transport\n[105].\n8. Patient Assessment and Injury Patterns by Body Region\nFor patients with a significant MOI and serious/critical condition, perform a rapid\nphysical exam [107]. Focus on the chief complaint while assessing the whole patient\n[108]. Common injury patterns are seen in different body regions.\nHead injuries: Disability and unseen brain injury can occur [110]. Bleeding or\nswelling inside the skull is often life-threatening [111]. Include frequent\nneurologic examinations [111]. Signs and symptoms may appear minutes or\nhours later [111].\nNeck and Throat injuries: Airway problems can quickly become lifethreatening\n[112]. Frequent physical exams, including DCAP-BTLS\n(Deformities, Contusions, Abrasions, Punctures/Penetrations, Burns,\nTenderness, Lacerations, Swelling), are essential [113]. Assess for jugular vein\ndistension and tracheal deviation [114]. Swelling can impede blood flow to\nthe brain [114]. Crushing injuries to the upper neck can fracture airway\ncartilage [115].\nChest injuries: The chest contains the heart, lungs, and large vessels [116].\nMany life-threatening injuries are possible [116].\nBroken ribs can hinder breathing [117].\nBruising to the heart can cause irregular rhythms [117].\nTorn large vessels can cause massive unseen bleeding [117].\nAir collection between the lung and chest wall is a pneumothorax [118].\nBlood collection in the chest is a hemothorax [118].\nA penetrating chest wound is an open chest wound [119].\nIf untreated, shock may occur [120]. Assess the chest every five minutes [120].\nAssessment includes DCAP-BTLS, lung sounds, and chest rise/fall [121].\nAbdomen injuries: The abdomen holds vital organs with high blood flow [122].\nSolid organs (liver, spleen, pancreas, kidneys) can tear, lacerate, or\nfracture, causing serious bleeding [123].\nHollow organs (stomach, intestines, bladder) can rupture, leaking toxic\ndigestive chemicals and causing life-threatening infection [125].\nRuptured blood vessels can cause serious unseen bleeding [126].\nBody\nRegion\nKey Assessment Points Common Injury Patterns\nHead Neurologic exams, check\nfor bleeding/swelling [110]\nUnseen brain injury, bleeding/swelling\ninside skull [110]\nNeck and\nThroat\nDCAP-BTLS, jugular vein\ndistension, tracheal\ndeviation [113]\nAirway problems, impeded blood flow\nto brain, fractured cartilage [112]\nChest DCAP-BTLS, lung sounds,\nchest rise/fall, assess\nevery 5 minutes [120]\nBroken ribs, heart bruising, torn\nvessels, pneumothorax, hemothorax,\nopen chest wound [117]\nAbdomen Assess for signs of\nsolid/hollow organ injury,\nbleeding [122]\nSolid organ tears/lacerations/fractures\n(bleeding), hollow organ rupture\n(infection) [123]\n9. Transport Decisions and Trauma Center Levels\nScene time survival is critical for trauma patients [127]. On-scene time for critically\ninjured patients should be less than 10 minutes [127].\nCriteria for identifying a critically injured patient include:\nDangerous mechanism of injury [128].\nDecreased level of consciousness [129].\nThreats to the airway, breathing, or circulation [129].\nVery young or very old patients, or those with chronic illness [129].\nTrauma centers are classified into levels one through four [130].\nLevel one: Provides every aspect of trauma care, most resources [131].\nLevel two: Provides initial definitive care [132].\nLevel three: Provides assessment, resuscitation, emergency care, and\nstabilization [133].\nLevel four: Provides advanced trauma life support [133].\nCriteria for using emergency air medical services for trauma patients:\nExtended time to access or extricate a remote/trapped patient [135].\nDistance to a trauma center is more than 20-25 miles [135].\nPatient needs advanced care, and no ALS ground ambulance is available [135].\nTraffic or hospital availability makes ground transport to a trauma center\nunlikely [136].\nMultiple trauma patients overwhelm nearby hospitals [137].\nEMS system requires transport to the nearest hospital instead of bypassing to\na trauma center, delaying definitive surgical care [138].\nMass casualty event [139].\nTrauma centers are categorized as adult or pediatric, not necessarily both [140].\nModes of transport are ground or air [141]. Ground units are staffed by EMTs and\nparamedics [142]. Air or critical care units are staffed by critical care nurses and\nparamedics [142]. Special considerations during transport include staying calm,\ncompleting a thorough assessment, correcting life-threatening injuries, doing no\nharm, and contacting ALS backup or medical control if needed [142].",

Introduction to Bleeding and the Circulatory System\nComponent Function\nHeart Pumps blood [7]\nBlood Vessels Serve as the container for blood [7]\nBlood and Body Fluids The fluid circulated [7]\nBleeding can be external and visible or internal and hidden [4].\nBoth types of bleeding are potentially dangerous and can lead to weakness, shock,\nand death [4].\nUncontrolled bleeding is a common cause of hypoperfusion following traumatic\ninjury [5].\nThe circulatory system circulates blood to all body cells and tissues [5].\nIt delivers oxygen and nutrients and carries away metabolic waste products [6].\nThe system is responsible for supplying and maintaining adequate blood flow [6].\nThe contents of the circulatory system are the heart (pump), blood vessels\n(container), and blood and body fluids (fluid) [7].\nThe heart requires a rich and well-distributed blood supply [9].\nIt works as two paired pumps: the upper chamber (atrium) and the lower chamber\n(ventricles) [10].\nBlood leaves each chamber through a one-way valve [11].\nTypes of blood vessels include arteries, arterioles, capillaries, venules, and veins [13]\n.\nOxygen and nutrients pass from capillaries into cells, while waste and carbon dioxide\ndiffuse from cells back into capillaries [14].\nBlood contains red blood cells (oxygen/carbon dioxide transport), white blood cells\n(fighting infection), platelets (forming blood clots), and plasma (liquid part) [15].\nBlood clot formation depends on blood stasis, changes in blood vessel walls (like a\nwound), or the blood\u0027s ability to clot [18].\nThe autonomic nervous system monitors the body\u0027s needs and adjusts blood flow by\nconstricting or dilating blood vessels [20].\nIt automatically redirects blood away from other organs to the heart, brain, lungs, and\nkidneys in an emergency [22].\nThis system adapts to changing conditions and maintains homeostasis and perfusion\n[22].\n2. Pathophysiology and Perfusion\nperfusion is the circulation of blood within an organ or tissue [24].\nIt must be in adequate amounts to meet cell needs for oxygen, nutrients, and waste\nremoval [24].\nBlood flow speed must be fast enough to maintain adequate circulation and avoid\nclotting [24].\nIt must also be slow enough to allow cells time to exchange oxygen and nutrients for\nwaste products [24].\nSome tissues need a constant blood supply [25].\nOthers can survive with very little blood [25].\nAll tissues, organs, and organ systems rely on adequate perfusion to function\nproperly [26].\nSome organs cannot tolerate a blood supply interruption for more than a few minutes\nwithout damage [27].\nDeath of an organ system can quickly lead to the death of a patient [28].\nThe heart requires a constant flow of blood [29].\nIf the circulatory system fails to provide significant circulation, shock results [23].\n3. External Bleeding: Characteristics and Assessment\nType of\nBleeding\nCharacteristics Manageability Appearance Spurting Clotting\nArterial Pressure\ncauses spurting\n[38]\nDifficult to\ncontrol [38]\nBrighter red\n[39]\nSpurts with\npulse [39]\nLess likely to\nclot\nspontaneously\n[41]\nVenous Does not spurt\n[40]\nEasy to\nmanage [40]\nDark red [39] Does not\nspurt [40]\nMore likely to\nclot\nspontaneously\n[40]\nCapillary Oozes from\nwound [41]\nSteady but\nslowly [41]\nDark red [41] Oozes [41] More likely to\nclot\nspontaneously\nthan arterial\n[41]\nhemorrhage means bleeding, and external bleeding is a visible hemorrhage [29].\nWith serious external bleeding, estimating the amount of blood loss can be difficult [30]\n.\nBlood looks different on different surfaces, making estimation important [31].\nThe body cannot tolerate an acute blood loss greater than 20 percent of blood\nvolume (about two pints) [32].\nAdverse changes in vital signs occur with significant blood loss [33].\nThese include an increase in heart rate, an increase in respiratory rate, and a\ndecrease in blood pressure [33].\nHow well people compensate for blood loss depends on how rapidly they bleed [34].\nRapid blood loss, even if less than 20%, can cause signs of hypovolemic shock [35].\nThe patient\u0027s age and pre-existing health should also be considered [36].\nBleeding is considered serious if certain conditions are present [37].\nThese conditions include poor general appearance, no response to external stimuli,\nsigns of shock, significant blood loss, rapid blood loss, uncontrolled bleeding, or a\nsignificant mechanism of injury [37].\nTypes of external bleeding are arterial, venous, and capillary [38].\nArterial bleeding spurts with the pulse and is typically brighter red [39].\nVenous bleeding is dark red and does not spurt [40].\nCapillary bleeding is dark red and oozes slowly [41].\nVenous and capillary bleeding are more likely to clot spontaneously than arterial\nbleeding [40].\n4. The Clotting Process and Hemophilia\nBleeding tends to stop within about 10 minutes in response to internal mechanisms\nand exposure to air [42].\nWhen skin is broken, blood flows rapidly from the open vessel [42].\nThe cut ends of the vessel begin to narrow, a process called vasoconstriction [43].\nvasoconstriction reduces the amount of bleeding [44].\nThen a clot forms [44].\nBleeding will not stop if a clot does not form, unless the injured vessel is cut off by\ndirect pressure or a tourniquet [45].\nWith hemophilia, the patient lacks one or more blood clotting factors [46].\nBleeding may occur spontaneously in hemophiliacs [46].\nAll injuries, even trivial ones, are potentially serious for patients with hemophilia [46].\nhemophiliac patients should be transported immediately [46].\n5. Internal Bleeding: Recognition and Assessment\nPossible Causes Signs and Symptoms\nStomach ulcer [51] Pain (most common) [57]\nLacerated liver [51] Swelling in the area [57]\nRuptured spleen [51] Distension (chest cavity, lung) [57]\nBroken bones [51] Hematoma or bruising [57]\nContusions or\necchymosis [52]\nBleeding from any body opening (mouth, rectum, hematuria,\nvaginal, hematemesis, melena) [57]\nUlcers [55] Pain, tenderness, bruising, guarding, or swelling (possible\nfractures) [58]\nBleeding in the colon [55] Rigid, distended abdomen [58]\nRuptured ectopic\npregnancy [55]\nChange in mental status (anxiety, restlessness,\ncombativeness) [59]\nAneurysms [55] Weakness, faintness, or dizziness on standing [59]\nClosed unstable pelvic\nfracture [111]\nChange in skin [60]\nTachycardia [60]\nThirst [60]\nNausea and vomiting [60]\nCool, moist, clammy skin [60]\nShallow, rapid breathing [60]\nDull eyes, slightly dilated pupils slow to respond to light [60]\nCap refill over two seconds (infants, children) [61]\nWeak rapid pulse [61]\nDecreasing blood pressure [61]\nAltered mental status [61]\nInternal bleeding can be very serious because it is not easy to detect immediately [48]\n.\nInjury or damage to internal organs commonly causes extensive internal bleeding [49].\nInternal bleeding can lead to hypovolemic shock [50].\nPossible causes include stomach ulcers, lacerated liver, ruptured spleen, and broken\nbones [51].\nSigns of internal bleeding may include contusions or ecchymosis [52].\nA high-speed mechanism of injury increases suspicion for serious unseen injury [52].\nBlunt trauma and penetrating trauma are mechanisms for internal bleeding [53].\nThe mnemonic DCAP-BTLS is used to assess for signs of injuries [53].\nThis stands for deformities, contusions, abrasions, punctures, penetrations, burns,\nlateral tenderness, laceration, swelling, and other signs of injury [53].\nInternal bleeding is not always caused by trauma [54].\nNon-traumatic causes can be ulcers, bleeding in the colon, ruptured ectopic\npregnancy, or aneurysms [55].\nRecognizing a patient in shock and responding appropriately is important [56].\nSigns and symptoms of internal bleeding include pain, swelling, distension, and\nbruising (hematoma) [57].\nBleeding from any body opening can indicate internal bleeding [57].\nThis includes bright red bleeding from the mouth or rectum, hematuria, non-menstrual\nvaginal bleeding, hematemesis (vomiting blood), and melena (black, tarry stool) [57].\nPain, tenderness, bruising, guarding, or swelling can indicate possible closed fractures\nor broken ribs [58].\nA rigid, distended abdomen might be seen [58].\nhypoperfusion (hypovolemic shock) can cause changes in mental status like anxiety,\nrestlessness, or combativeness [59].\nWeakness, faintness, or dizziness on standing are signs [59].\nChanges in skin can also occur [60].\nLater signs of hypoperfusion include tachycardia, weakness, fainting, thirst, nausea,\nvomiting, and cool, clammy skin [60].\nShallow, rapid breathing, dull eyes, slightly dilated pupils, and a weak rapid pulse may\nbe present [60].\nCapillary refill over two seconds in infants and children is a sign [61].\nDecreasing blood pressure and altered mental status are also indicators [61].\nPatients with these signs and symptoms require prompt transport [61].\n6. Patient Assessment in Bleeding Emergencies\nThe scene size-up involves being alert for potential hazards, especially in violent\nincidents [62].\nEnsure police are on scene if necessary and follow standard precautions [62].\nConsider the mechanism of injury and the need for spinal immobilization and\nadditional resources [62].\nThe primary assessment focuses on identifying life threats without distraction [63].\nForm a general impression to identify serious conditions [64].\nPerform a rapid exam [65].\nAddress obvious life-threatening external bleeding first [65].\nAssess skin color [65].\nDetermine the level of consciousness using the AVPU scale [66].\nAssess the ABCs (Airway, Breathing, Circulation) and the D (Transport Decision)\n[67].\nEnsure a patent airway and provide high-flow oxygen [67].\nAssist ventilations if needed using a bag-valve mask or non-rebreather mask [68].\nInsert an oral pharyngeal airway if the patient is unconscious [68].\nAssess pulse rate and quality, skin condition, color, temperature, and cap refill time for\ncirculation [69].\nControl external bleeding and treat for shock [69].\nMake the transport decision based on ABCs and life threats [70].\nPatients with significant bleeding can become unstable quickly [72].\nSigns needing rapid transport include tachycardia, tachypnea, low blood pressure,\nweak pulse, or clammy skin [73].\nHistory taking involves investigating the chief complaint [74].\nLook for signs and symptoms of other injuries based on the mechanism of injury or\nnature of illness [75].\nGather the SAMPLE history (Signs, Allergies, Medications, Past medical history, Last\noral intake, Events leading up to injury) [76].\nAsk about blood-thinning medications [76].\nFor unresponsive patients, get history from medical alert tags or bystanders [77].\nLook for signs of shock and estimate the amount of blood loss [77].\nThe secondary assessment involves assessing all areas using DCAP-BTLS [78].\nCheck the head for uncontrolled bleeding from scalp lacerations [79].\nFeel all four abdominal quadrants for tenderness or rigidity [80].\nRecord pulse, motor, and sensory functions in the extremities [81].\nRecord vital signs [81].\nWith critically injured patients or short transport times, a full secondary assessment\nmay not be possible [82].\nReassessment is done frequently, especially in areas with abnormal findings [83].\nReassess unstable patients every 5 minutes and stable patients every 15 minutes [83].\nInterventions include high-flow oxygen, controlling external bleeding, treating for\nshock, and rapid transport [84].\nIf internal bleeding is suspected, provide high-flow oxygen and rapid transport [85].\nDo not delay transport to complete assessments [86].\n7. Emergency Care for External Bleeding\nMethod Application Notes\nDirect Pressure Apply glove fingertip\nor hand over sterile\ndressing [94]\nMost common and effective method [92].\nApply pressure for at least 5 minutes [95].\nPressure Dressing Wrap sterile, selfadhering\nroller\nbandage around\nwound [96]\nStretch tight enough to control bleeding [96].\nShould still feel distal pulse [97]. Do not\nremove until physician evaluates [98]. Add\nmore dressings if bleeds through [99].\nTourniquets Apply above the\nlevel of bleeding\n[100]\nUseful for substantial extremity bleeding not\ncontrolled by direct pressure [99]. If not\npossible, consider additional tourniquet or\nwound packing [100]. Follow skill drill 26-3 [108].\nHemostatic\nDressing/Wound\nPacking\nPack gauze or\ndressing into larger\nwounds [103]\nUsed when direct pressure is inadequate or\ntourniquet is not possible [103]. Hemostatic\ndressing has chemical to promote clot\nformation [104]. Can be used with wound\npacking and direct pressure [105]. Follow skill\ndrill 26-2 [106].\nJunctional\nTourniquets\nApply for proximal\ncompression in\nareas like groin or\naxilla [108]\nFor severe hemorrhage at the junction of\ntorso with arms/legs [109]. Pelvic binder is a\ntype [109].\nAir Splints Apply to entire\nextremity [109]\nControls internal and external bleeding with\nsevere extremity injuries [109]. Immobilizes\nfractures [109]. Acts like a pressure dressing\n[109].\nPelvic Binder Apply for suspected\nclosed unstable\npelvic fracture [110]\nHelps control internal bleeding, especially\nwith life-threatening open-book pelvic\nfracture [111].\nFollow standard precautions when providing emergency care for external bleeding\n[88].\nWear a mask, gloves, eye protection, and sometimes a gown [88].\nEnsure the patient has an open airway and is breathing adequately [89].\nProvide high-flow oxygen [90].\nIf obvious life-threatening bleeding is present, control it quickly [90].\nSeveral methods exist to control external bleeding [91].\nThese include direct pressure, pressure dressings, tourniquets, hemostatic\ndressing, and wound packing [91].\nDirect pressure is the most common and effective method [92].\nPressure stops blood flow and allows normal coagulation [93].\nApply pressure with a gloved fingertip or hand over a sterile dressing [94].\nFor a protruding object, stabilize it with bulky dressing and apply pressure [95].\nHold uninterrupted pressure for at least five minutes [95].\nA pressure dressing involves wrapping a sterile, self-adhering bandage firmly around\nthe wound [96].\nStretch the bandage tightly enough to control bleeding [96].\nYou should still feel a distal pulse after applying the dressing [97].\nDo not remove the dressing until a physician has evaluated the patient [98].\nAdd more dressings if the first one bleeds through [99].\nA tourniquet is useful for substantial extremity bleeding not controlled by direct\npressure [99].\nApply the tourniquet above the level of bleeding [100].\nIf a single tourniquet is not possible, consider an additional one or wound packing [100].\nFollow the skill drill for applying a commercial tourniquet [108].\nWound packing uses gauze packed into larger wounds [103].\nThis is done when direct pressure is inadequate or a tourniquet is not possible [103].\nA hemostatic dressing is impregnated with a chemical that promotes clot formation\n[104].\nIt can be used with wound packing and direct pressure [105].\nFollow the skill drill for wound packing [106].\njunctional tourniquets provide proximal compression for bleeding in areas like the\ngroin or axilla [108].\nThey are indicated for severe hemorrhage at the junction of the torso with limbs [109].\nA pelvic binder is a type of junctional tourniquet [109].\nair splints can control internal and external bleeding associated with severe extremity\ninjuries [109].\nThey also immobilize fractures and act as a pressure dressing for an entire extremity\n[109].\nA pelvic binder is indicated for suspected closed unstable pelvic fractures [110].\nIt helps control internal bleeding from open-book pelvic fractures [111].\n8. Emergency Care for Internal Bleeding and Special Cases\nControlling internal bleeding or bleeding from a major organ usually requires surgery\nor other hospital procedures [120].\nTry to keep the patient calm, reassured, and quiet [120].\nProvide high-flow oxygen [121].\nMaintain the patient\u0027s body temperature [121].\nSplint the injured extremity, usually with an air splint [121].\nNever use a tourniquet to control bleeding from a closed internal or soft tissue injury\n[121].\nFollow the skill drill for caring for patients with internal bleeding [121].\nBleeding from the nose, ears, or mouth can result from several conditions [112].\nThese include skull fracture, facial injury, sinusitis, infection, nose drop abuse, dried\nnasal mucosa, high blood pressure, coagulation disorders, digital trauma, or cancer\n[112].\nEpistaxis (nosebleed) is a common emergency [114].\nIt can occasionally cause enough blood loss to lead to shock [114].\nMuch of the blood may pass down the throat into the stomach [115].\nSwallowing a large amount of blood can cause nausea and vomiting [115].\nMost non-traumatic nosebleeds occur from sites in the septum [115].\nPinching the nostrils together is usually effective for this type of bleeding [115].\nBleeding from the nose or ears after a head injury may indicate a skull fracture [116].\nThis type of bleeding may be difficult to control [116].\nDo not attempt to stop this blood flow by applying excessive pressure [116].\nExcessive pressure may force blood to collect in the head [116].\nLoosely cover the bleeding site with a sterile gauze pad to collect blood [117].\nThis also keeps contaminants away [117].\nApply light compression by wrapping a bulky dressing around the head [118].\nA target or halo shaped stain on the dressing may indicate the presence of\ncerebrospinal fluid [119].\n9. Communication and Documentation\nDo not delay transport of any patient to complete assessments [86].\nIt is essential to communicate and document in bleeding emergencies [86].\nRecognize, estimate, and report the amount of blood loss [86].\nReport how rapidly the bleeding occurred [87].\nCommunicate all relevant information to the staff at the receiving hospital [87].\nThis includes all injuries, the care provided, and the patient\u0027s response [87].\n10. Conclusion and Review\nWhat is not a component of the cardiovascular system? The lungs are part of the\nrespiratory system [123].\nHow is perfusion most accurately defined? It is the circulation of enough oxygen and\nnutrients in significant amounts [124].\nWhich injury is the highest treatment priority for a man in a motorcycle crash with\nmultiple abrasions and lacerations? A one-inch laceration on the thigh squirting blood\n(arterial bleeding) is the highest priority [126].\nWhich set of vital signs is least indicative of internal bleeding? Vital signs that do not\nshow significant changes are least indicative [128].\nWhen caring for a patient with internal bleeding, what must the EMT do first? The EMT\nmust first take appropriate standard precautions [129].\nWhat is the quickest and most effective way to control external bleeding from an\nextremity? Direct pressure is the quickest and most effective way [130].\nWhen applying a tourniquet to an amputated arm, what should the EMT do? The EMT\nshould avoid applying it over a joint [131].\nWhat is the most likely contributing factor to a nosebleed in a 70-year-old man with a\nhistory of cardiac issues and high blood pressure? High blood pressure is the most\nlikely contributing factor [132].\nWhen caring for epistaxis, what is the most effective way to prevent aspiration of\nblood? Leaning the patient forward and tilting them forward is most effective [135].\nWhat does controlling internal bleeding typically require? Controlling internal bleeding\nusually requires surgical intervention [136].\nThis concludes the chapter on bleeding [137].",

Introduction to Soft-Tissue Injuries\nSoft tissue injuries are common [4]. They can be as serious as life-threatening internal injuries\n[4]. You should not become distracted by dramatic open wounds [5]. Soft tissues can be\ninjured by blunt force, penetrating injury, barotrauma, or burns [5]. Wound care is frequently\nperformed in emergency departments [8]. Most injuries require basic interventions [9]. Death is\noften related to hemorrhage or infection [10]. Infection can be life or limb threatening [11]. This\nis especially true in children, older adults, and people with weakened immune systems [11].\nSimple protective actions can often prevent injuries and complications [12].\n2. Anatomy and Physiology of the Skin\nLayer Description Contents Function Source\nEpidermis Tough external\nlayer, watertight\ncovering [21]\nComposed of\nseveral layers [22]\nForms a watertight\ncovering for the\nbody [21]\n[21]\nDermis Inner layer of\nskin [22]\nHair follicles, sweat\nglands,\nsubcutaneous\nglands [23]\nProvides skin with\nnutrients and\noxygen via blood\nvessels [24]\n[22]\nMucous\nMembranes\nLine body\nopenings [26]\nN/A Provide a\nprotective barrier\nagainst bacterial\ninvasion [26]\n[26]\nThe skin is the body\u0027s first line of defense [14]. It protects against external forces and infection\n[14]. It is the largest organ in the body [15]. Skin varies in thickness with age and location [18].\nInjuries can expose blood vessels, nerves, and bones [16]. The EMT must control bleeding and\nprevent contamination [17]. Protecting wounds and applying dressings is important [17]. The\nskin is a barrier against infection [27]. It is also a sensory organ [27]. It assists with body\ntemperature regulation [27]. Skin helps maintain fluid balance [27]. A break in the skin allows\nbacteria to enter [28]. This increases the possibility of infection, fluid loss, and loss of\ntemperature control [28].\n3. Pathophysiology of Wound Healing\nHealing of wounds is a natural process [31]. It involves several overlapping stages [31]. All\nstages aim to maintain homeostasis [31]. Cessation of bleeding is the primary concern [32]. The\nnext stage is inflammation [32]. Additional cells move to the damaged area to begin repair [32].\nWhite blood cells migrate to combat pathogens [33]. Lymphocytes destroy bacteria and\npathogens [34]. Mast cells release histamine [34]. Inflammation removes foreign material and\ndamaged cells [35]. A new layer of cells moves into the region [36]. New blood vessels form to\nbring oxygen and nutrients [37]. Collagen provides stability to damaged tissue [38]. It joins\nwound borders, closing the open tissue [38].\n4. Closed Soft-Tissue Injuries\nType of Injury Cause Characteristics Potential\nComplications\nSource\nContusion Blunt force\ntrauma [39]\nEpidermis intact,\ndamaged dermis\ncells, torn blood\nvessels [40]\nBlue/black\ndiscoloration\n(echomosis) [42]\n[39]\nHematoma Damage to a\nlarge blood\nvessel [44]\nCollection of blood\nin damaged tissues\nor body cavity [43]\nRapid bleeding,\nextensive tissue\ndamage [44]\n[43]\nCrush Injuries Compression of\nsoft tissue [46]\nDamage depends\non force and\nduration [46]\nCirculation cut\noff, tissue\ndestruction [47]\n[46]\nCrush\nSyndrome\nArea trapped for\nlonger than 4\nhours,\ncompromised\narterial flow [48]\nMuscle cells die,\nrelease harmful\nsubstances into\ncirculation [49]\nCardiac arrest,\nrenal failure [50]\n[48]\nCompartment\nSyndrome\nEdema and\nswelling cause\nincreased\npressure [51]\nPressure interferes\nwith circulation,\nnutrient/oxygen\ndelivery impaired\n[52]\nPain (especially\non passive\nmovement),\ntissue death [53]\n[51]\ncontusions result from blunt force trauma [39]. The epidermis remains intact [40]. Cells within\nthe dermis are damaged [40]. Small blood vessels are usually torn [41]. Blood buildup produces\necchymosis [42]. A hematoma is blood collection within damaged tissues [43]. It occurs when a\nlarge blood vessel is damaged [44]. Crush injuries depend on force and duration [46].\nContinued compression cuts off circulation [47]. crush syndrome can develop after prolonged\nentrapment [48]. Damaged muscle cells release harmful substances [49]. compartment\nsyndrome develops from increased pressure within a compartment [51]. This interferes with\ncirculation and oxygen delivery [52]. Severe closed injuries can damage internal organs [56].\nReassess skin color, temperature, and pulses distal to the injury [55].\n5. Open Soft-Tissue Injuries\nType of\nInjury\nCause Characteristics Management/Considerations Source\nAbrasion Friction\nwhen body\npart rubs\nor scrapes\na rough\nsurface [60]\nWound of the\nsuperficial skin\nlayer [60]\nCaused by friction [60]\n[60]\nLaceration Jagged cut\nby sharp\nobject or\nblunt force\n[61]\nTissue is torn\n[61]\nCaused by sharp object or\nblunt force [61]\n[61]\nAvulsion Separates\nlayers of\ntissue [61]\nTissues\nbecome\ncompletely\ndetached or\nhang as a flap\n[61]\nOften significant bleeding,\nreplace flap if possible, never\nremove [62]\n[61]\nAmputation Body part\nis\ncompletely\nsevered\n[64]\nBody part\ncompletely\nsevered [64]\nComplete severance of a body\npart [64]\n[64]\nPenetrating\nWounds\nUsually\nfrom sharp\nobjects or\nprojectiles\n[65]\nSmall entrance\nwounds, little\nexternal\nbleeding,\nforeign material\nmay be present\ndeep inside [65]\nMay damage deep structures,\nrisk of infection, assess\ncarefully [65]\n[65]\nImpaled\nObject\nObject\nremains\nembedded\nin tissue\n[65]\nMay damage\nstructures deep\ninside, foreign\nmaterial present\n[65]\nRemove only if in cheek/mouth\nobstructing airway or in chest\ninterfering with CPR [125]\n[65]\nBlast\nInjuries\nExplosion\n[70]\nOften result in\nmultiple\npenetrating\ninjuries [70]\nMechanism due to blast wave,\nflying debris, or victim being\nthrown [71]\n[70]\nFour types of open wounds are abrasions, lacerations, avulsions, and penetrating wounds [58].\nAn abrasion is a superficial wound from friction [60]. A laceration is a jagged cut from a sharp\nobject or blunt force [61]. An avulsion separates tissue layers [61]. Tissues may be detached or\nhang as a flap [61]. avulsions often have significant bleeding [62]. Replace the flap if possible;\nnever remove it [63]. An amputation is complete severance of a body part [64]. penetrating\nwounds usually have small entrance wounds [65]. They produce little external bleeding [65].\nImpaled objects may damage deep structures [65]. Foreign materials inside tissue can cause\ninfection [66]. Stabbings and shootings often cause multiple penetrating injuries [67]. Assess\npatients carefully to find all wounds [68]. Count penetrating injuries, especially gunshot\nwounds [68]. Blast injuries often result in multiple penetrating injuries [70]. blast injury\nmechanisms include the blast wave, flying debris, and the victim being thrown [71].\n6. Patient Assessment for Soft-Tissue Injuries\nAssessing a closed injury is more difficult than an open injury [75]. Begin with scene size-up\n[75]. Look for indicators of the mechanism of injury [76]. This helps suspect underlying injuries\n[76]. The mechanism of injury provides safety threat information [77]. Use all information to\nevaluate scene safety [78]. Consider if additional resources are needed [78]. Perform a primary\nassessment [79]. Focus on identifying life threats and transport priority [79]. Form your general\nimpression [80]. Look for indicators of the patient\u0027s condition seriousness [81]. Assess\nresponsiveness using AVPU [81]. Administer high flow oxygen to patients less than alert [81].\nTreat for potential shock and provide immediate transport [81]. Significant bleeding is an\nimmediate life threat [82]. It must be controlled before opening the airway [82]. If lifethreatening\nexternal bleeding is obvious, control it first [82]. This helps treat for shock [83].\nEnsure the airway is clear and patent [85]. Auscultate for clear breath sounds [85]. Assess for\nequal chest rise [85]. Provide high flow oxygen or assist ventilations if needed [85]. Evaluate\nopen chest wounds for air movement [86]. Consider appropriate transport destination [88].\nPatients needing immediate transport include those with a poor general impression or altered\nlevel of consciousness [89]. Dyspnea, abnormal vital signs, shock, and severe pain also\nindicate immediate transport [89].\nNext, take history [90]. Investigate the chief complaint [90]. Use SAMPLE and OPQRST for\ntrauma patients [90]. Look for DCAP-BTLS during assessments [90]. If the patient is\nunresponsive, get history from another source [91]. Chronic medical conditions can complicate\nopen injuries [92]. Assess interventions and repeat vital signs en route [93]. Assess all\nautonomic regions [94]. Look for jugular vein distension and tracheal deviation in the neck [95].\nCheck the pelvis for stability [96]. Check the abdomen for tenderness, rigidity, and bruising [97]\n. Check extremities and record pulse, motor, and sensory function [98]. Signs of poor perfusion\nindicate rapid transport [99]. These include tachycardia, tachypnea, low blood pressure, and\ncool, pale skin [100]. Conduct reassessment regularly during transport [101]. Repeat the primary\nassessment [101]. Pay attention to areas of concern [101]. Assess the effectiveness of prior\ntreatments [101]. Reassess vital signs and chief complaint [101]. Identify and treat changes in\ncondition [102]. Communicate and document findings for the hospital [102]. Include mechanism\nof injury and patient position [102]. Report estimated blood loss [102]. Include location and\ndescription of wounds treated [102]. Describe the size and depth of the injury [102]. Provide an\naccurate account of treatment [102].\n7. Emergency Care for Closed Soft-Tissue Injuries\nSmall contusions generally require no special emergency care [103]. Note their presence to\ndetermine injury extent [104]. More extensive closed injuries can have significant swelling and\nbleeding [105]. This could lead to hypovolemic shock [105]. Injuries might not show swelling or\nbruising initially [106]. Watch any injury closely while caring for the patient [107]. Treat closed\nsoft tissue injuries using the rice mnemonic [108]. rice stands for Rest, Ice, Compression,\nElevation, and Splinting [108]. Be alert for signs of developing shock [108]. Signs include anxiety,\nchanges in mental status, increased heart rate and respiratory rate [108]. Diaphoresis, cool\nskin, and decreased blood pressure are also signs [108]. If the patient shows signs of shock,\ntreat accordingly and aggressively [109].\n8. Emergency Care for Open Soft-Tissue Injuries\nInjury Type Emergency Care Procedures Source\nGeneral Open\nWounds\nFollow standard precautions, control bleeding with direct\npressure, pressure dressings, splints, or tourniquets; apply\nsterile dressing, do not remove material, flush small wounds\nwith sterile water if no significant bleeding [110]\n[110]\nAbdominal\nWounds\nCover with sterile moistened gauze, secure with occlusive\ndressing, keep organs moist and warm, immediate transport\nto trauma center [120]\n[120]\nImpaled\nObjects\nTreat following skill drill 27-1, remove only if obstructing\nairway in cheek/mouth or interfering with CPR in chest,\nsecure and shorten long objects, provide rapid transport [124]\n[124]\nOpen Neck\nInjuries\nCover with occlusive dressing, apply manual pressure, do not\ncompress both carotid arteries simultaneously, use caution\ndepending on mechanism [130]\n[130]\nAnimal Bites\n(Small)\nConsider contaminated and potentially infected, evaluated\nby physician, major concern for rabies, ensure animal is\nsecured before entering scene [134]\n[134]\nHuman Bites Contains wide range of bacteria/viruses, considered very\nserious if skin penetrated, lacerations by human tooth can\ncause serious infection spread [138]\n[138]\nBites\n(General\nCare)\nApply dry sterile dressing, immobilize area with\nsplint/bandage, transport for surgical cleansing and\nantibiotics [142]\n[142]\nBefore caring for an open wound, follow standard precautions [110]. If life-threatening bleeding\nis seen, apply direct pressure [110]. Control bleeding using direct pressure and elevation [111].\nPressure dressings or splints, and possibly tourniquets can be used [111]. All open wounds are\nassumed contaminated and a risk of infection [112]. Applying a sterile dressing reduces\ncontamination risk [113]. Do not remove material from the open wound [114]. Small wounds\nwithout significant bleeding can be flushed with sterile water [114]. Chemical burns should be\nflushed to remove chemicals [115]. Hospital personnel usually clean open wounds [116].\nSplinting can help control bleeding even without a fracture [117].\nFor abdominal wounds, organs may expose from the wound [118]. This is an evisceration [119].\nCover the wound with sterile, moistened gauze [120]. Secure the gauze with an occlusive\ndressing [121]. Keep the organs moist and warm [122]. Most abdominal wounds require\nimmediate transport to a trauma center [123]. Treat impaled objects following skill drill 27-1 [124]\n. Remove impaled objects only if obstructing the airway in the cheek/mouth or interfering with\nCPR in the chest [125]. Secure and shorten very long objects [126]. Provide rapid transport [126].\nOpen neck injuries can be life-threatening [127]. Open neck veins may suck air in [128]. Air\nentering a blood vessel can block blood flow in the lungs [129]. This can cause cardiac arrest\nfrom an air embolism [129]. Cover the wound with an occlusive dressing [130]. Manually apply\npressure [130]. Do not compress both carotid arteries simultaneously [130]. This could impair\nbrain circulation and cause a stroke [130]. Use caution with neck injury patients depending on\nthe mechanism [131].\nSmall animal bites are heavily contaminated with bacteria [134]. Consider all small animal bites\ncontaminated [134]. All small animal bites should be evaluated by a physician [134]. Rabies is a\nmajor concern [135]. Rabies is a fatal viral infection of the central nervous system [135]. It\naffects all warm-blooded animals [135]. Children may be seriously injured or killed by dogs [136].\nThe animal may attack you [137]. Do not enter the scene until the animal is secured [137].\nHuman mouths contain a wide range of bacteria and viruses [138]. Consider animal bites that\npenetrate the skin very serious [139]. lacerations by a human tooth can cause serious infection\nspread [140]. For bites, apply a dry sterile dressing [142]. Immobilize the area with a splint or\nbandage [142]. Transport to the emergency department for wound cleansing and antibiotics\n[142].\n9. Burns: Types and Pathophysiology\nBurns are among the most serious and painful injuries [143]. A burn occurs when the body\nreceives too much radiant heat [143]. This results in injury [143]. Sources include heat, toxic\nchemicals, or electricity [144]. Always perform a complete assessment [145]. Determine if other\nserious injuries are present [145]. Children, older patients, and those with chronic illness are\nmore likely to experience shock from burns [146]. Burns are soft tissue injuries over a large area\n[147]. They are created by transfer of energy [147]. Energy can be radiation, thermal, or\nelectrical [147]. Thermal burns occur when skin is exposed to temperatures over 111Â°F [148].\nBurn severity correlates with temperature, concentration of heat energy, and duration of\nexposure [149]. Burn injuries are progressive [150]. Greater heat energy means a deeper wound\n[150]. Exposure time is important [151]. Thermal injury can occur in unresponsive or paralyzed\npatients [151]. The skin barrier is destroyed when a person is burned [153]. Burns create a high\nrisk for infection [153]. Hypothermia, hypovolemia, and shock are also risks [153]. Burns to the\nairway are significant [154]. Loose mucosa in the hypopharynx swells [154]. This leads to\ncomplete airway obstruction [154]. Circumferential chest burns can compromise breathing [155].\nCircumferential extremity burns can lead to compartment syndrome [156]. This results in\nneurovascular compromise and irreversible damage [156]. Call for advanced life support if you\nsuspect complications [156].\n10. Burn Severity and Assessment\nFactor Determining\nSeverity\nDescription Source\nDepth How deep the burn is (superficial, partial thickness,\nfull thickness)\n[157]\nExtent Percentage of total body surface area burned (rule\nof palm, rule of nines)\n[157]\nCritical Areas Involved Face, upper airway, hands, feet, genitalia, over\njoints [157]\n[157]\nPatient Factors Pre-existing medical conditions/injuries, age (under\n5, older than 55) [157]\n[157]\nFive factors determine burn severity [157]. These are depth and extent of the burn [157]. Critical\nareas involved are also important [157]. These include the face, upper airway, hands, feet, or\ngenitalia [157]. Pre-existing medical conditions or injuries matter [157]. Patient age is a factor\n(under five or older than 55) [157]. Burns to the face are important due to potential airway\ninvolvement [158]. Hand, foot, or joint burns are serious due to potential function loss from\nscarring [158].\nThere are three types of burn depth: first, second, and third degree [158]. First degree is\nsuperficial [160]. It involves only the epidermis [161]. The burn site is often painful [162]. A\nsunburn is a first degree burn example [163]. Partial thickness is a second degree burn [164]. It\ninvolves the epidermis and some dermis [165]. These burns do not destroy the skin\u0027s entire\nthickness [166]. Subcutaneous tissue is not injured [166]. Skin is typically moist and mottled [167].\nWhite or red blisters are present [167]. Second degree burns can cause intense pain [167]. Full\nthickness or third degree burns extend through all skin layers [168]. They may involve\nsubcutaneous layers, muscle, bone, or internal organs [168]. The burned area is dry and\nleathery [169]. It may appear white, dark brown, or charred [169]. If nerve endings are\ndestroyed, the burned area may have no feeling [170]. Surrounding, less severe areas may be\nvery painful [171]. Significant airway burns are serious [171]. Signs may include singed hair, soot,\nhoarseness, or hypoxia [171]. These patients need rapid transport for advanced airway\nmanagement [171].\nThe extent of burns is important [172]. We calculate extent using the rule of palm or rule of\nnines [173]. The rule of palm estimates surface area using the patient\u0027s palm size [174]. A\npatient\u0027s palm is roughly one percent of their total body surface [174]. The rule of nines divides\nbody parts into sections [175]. Each section represents approximately nine percent of the total\nbody surface area [175]. Proportions differ in infants, children, and adults [176]. When\ncalculating extent, include only partial and full thickness burns [176]. Document superficial\nburns but do not include them in the estimation [176].\n11. Assessment and Emergency Care for Burns\nWhen assessing a burn, classify it [179]. Classify based on source, depth, and severity [179].\nEnsure the scene is safe [180]. Make sure factors causing the burn are not a hazard [180].\nDetermine the type of burn sustained [181]. The patient\u0027s report provides important information\n[181]. Assess the scene for environmental hazards [182]. Determine the number of patients [182].\nCall for additional resources [182]. Consider potential for spinal immobilization or injuries [182].\nBegin the primary assessment with a rapid assessment [183]. Form a general impression [183].\nLook for clues to determine severity [183]. Be suspicious of clues indicating abuse [183].\nConsider the need for manual stabilization [183]. Check responsiveness using AVPU [184].\nAdminister high flow O2 to patients less than alert [184]. Provide immediate transport [184]. For\nairway and breathing, look for singed facial hair or soot [185]. Heavy secretions or coughing\nmay indicate respiratory burn [186]. For circulation, control major bleeding [187]. If obvious lifethreatening\nexternal bleeding exists, control it first [187]. Treat the patient for shock [187]. Treat\nshock in burn patients by preventing heat loss [188]. Cover them with a blanket [188]. Consider\nrapid transport for airway issues or significant burns [189]. Signs of external bleeding also\nrequire rapid transport [189]. Consider rendezvousing with advanced life support [189].\nNext, take history [190]. Investigate the chief complaint [190]. Be alert for signs of other injuries\n[191]. If burned in a confined space, suspect inhalation injuries [191]. Obtain medical history [191].\nBe alert for injury-specific signs and symptoms [191]. Obtain a SAMPLE history [191]. Ask about\ndifficulty breathing or swallowing [191]. Check for an emergency medical identification device\n[191]. The secondary assessment is a physical exam [192]. Assess the patient head to toe using\nDCAP-BTLS [193]. Estimate burn extent using the rule of nines [194]. Determine burn\nclassification and severity [194]. Package the patient for transport based on findings [195].\nObtain vital signs [195]. Use monitoring devices like oxygen saturation and carbon monoxide\nmonitors [195]. Reassess the patient and interventions en route [196]. Communicate and\ndocument findings for the hospital [196]. Describe how the burn occurred [196]. Describe the\nextent, body surface area, depth, and location [196]. Specifically mention and document if\nspecial areas are involved [197].\nYour first responsibility is to stop the burning process [199]. Prevent additional injury [199].\nWhen caring for a burn patient, follow skill drill 27-2 steps [200]. Stop the burning source [206].\nCool the burned area [206]. Remove all jewelry [206]. Maintain a high suspicion for inhalation\ninjuries [207]. Increased exposure time increases damage [207]. Larger burns make the patient\nsusceptible to hypothermia or hypovolemia [207]. Apply a dry sterile dressing to patients with\nlarge surface burns [208].\n12. Specific Types of Burns and Their Management\nType of\nBurn\nCause Characteristics Management Source\nThermal\nBurns\nHeat (scolds,\nopen flames, hot\nobjects, steam,\nflash) [201]\nDepth varies by cause\n(flame often deep,\nscalds common in\nchildren/handicapped,\ncontact rarely deep\nunless trapped) [202]\nStop burning\nsource, cool\nburned area,\nremove jewelry,\nhigh suspicion for\ninhalation injuries,\napply dry sterile\ndressing to large\nburns [206]\n[200]\nInhalation\nBurns\nBurning in\nenclosed spaces\nwithout\nventilation [209]\nUpper airway damage\nfrom superheated\ngases, lower airway\ndamage from\nchemicals/particulate\nmatter [210]\nImmediate\nintervention for\nsevere upper\nairway swelling,\nconsider ALS,\napply cool mist\naerosol/humidified\noxygen, suspect\nCO/cyanide\npoisoning [211]\n[209]\nChemical\nBurns\nToxic substance\ncontact (strong\nacids/alkalis) [220]\nSeverity related to\ntype, concentration,\nduration, eyes\nvulnerable [223]\nEnsure scene\nsafety (wait for\nHazmat), wear\nchemicalresistant\ngloves/eye\nprotection,\nremove dry\nchemicals by\nbrushing, flush\nliquid chemicals\nwith large\namounts of water\n(15-20 min), flush\nburned eyes,\nproperly dispose\nof decon fluid [223]\n[220]\nElectrical\nBurns\nContact with high\nor low voltage\nelectricity [229]\nInjury appears where\nelectricity enters and\nexits the body, large\ndeep tissue injury,\ncardiac/respiratory\narrest risk [234]\nEnsure scene\nsafety, begin\nCPR/AED if\nindicated, provide\nsupplemental\noxygen, monitor\nclosely, apply dry\nsterile dressings,\nsplint suspected\nfractures, prompt\ntransport [233]\n[229]\nTaser\nInjuries\nTaser darts\npuncture skin\n[240]\nBarbs are impaled\nobjects [241]\nTreated as\nimpaled objects,\nremoved by\nphysician\n(sometimes EMT\nper protocol),\npotential\ncomplications\nwith underlying\ndisorders (excited\ndelirium), have\nAED access [241]\n[240]\nRadiation\nBurns\nExposure to\nradioactive\nisotopes/radiation\n(terrorist attacks)\n[245]\nPotential threat from\nalpha (little\npenetration), beta\n(greater penetration),\ngamma (very\npenetrating) radiation\n[246]\nDetermine\nexposure and if\nongoing, wait for\nHazmat for decon,\nremove clothes\nfor most\ncontaminants,\ntreat ABCs once\nno threat, notify\nED, identify\nsource/duration of\nexposure, limit\nduration, increase\ndistance, use\nshielding [252]\n[245]\nThermal burns are caused by heat [201]. Common causes are scolds or open flames [201].\nFlame burns are often deep [202]. Scalds are commonly seen in children and handicapped\nadults [202]. Contact with hot objects causes contact burns [203]. Contact burns are rarely\ndeep unless the patient is trapped [203]. Steam burns can produce topical or scald burns [204].\nFlash burns are produced by an explosion [205]. Lightning strikes can cause a flash burn [205].\nInhalation burns occur when burning is in enclosed spaces [209]. Upper airway damage is from\nsuperheated gases [210]. Lower airway damage is from chemicals or particulate matter [210].\nSevere upper airway swelling may occur [211]. This requires immediate intervention [211].\nConsider requesting advanced life support [212]. Signs of edema include stridor or singed\nnasal hairs [212]. Burns to the face may also be present [212]. Cool mist aerosol or humidified\noxygen can reduce minor edema [213]. Consider carbon monoxide intoxication [215]. Hydrogen\ncyanide is also a concern [217]. Signs involve the central nervous system, respiratory, and\ncardiovascular systems [218]. Pre-hospital treatment includes decon and supportive care [219].\nChemical burns occur when a toxic substance contacts the body [220]. Most are caused by\nstrong acids or alkalis [221]. The eyes are particularly vulnerable [222]. Severity relates to the\nchemical type, concentration, and duration [223]. Ensure you can safely approach the patient\n[223]. You may need to wait for the Hazmat team to decon [224]. Wear appropriate chemicalresistant\ngloves and eye protection [224]. Remove the chemical from the patient first [225]. If\ndry, brush it off before flushing [225]. Remove all clothing and jewelry [225]. Take care not to\ncontact the chemical [226]. The patient should be properly deconned [227]. For liquid chemicals,\nimmediately flush the area with large amounts of water [227]. Continue flushing for 15 to 20\nminutes after burning stops [228]. If eyes are burned, hold the eye open and flood with a gentle\nwater stream [229]. Properly dispose of decon fluid [229].\nElectrical burns result from contact with electricity [229]. High voltage burns can occur from\npower lines [229]. Ordinary household current can cause severe burns and dysrhythmias [229].\nElectricity needs a complete circuit to flow [230]. An insulator prevents a circuit from\ncompleting [231]. A conductor allows current to flow [231]. The human body is a good conductor\n[232]. Electrical burns happen when the body completes a circuit [232]. Type of current,\nmagnitude, and voltage affect seriousness [232]. Your safety is important at electrical scenes\n[233]. A burn appears where electricity enters and exits [234]. Dangers include deep tissue\ninjury and cardiac/respiratory arrest [235]. Management includes starting CPR if indicated [238].\nUse an AED and be prepared to defibrillate [238]. Give supplemental oxygen and monitor\nclosely [238]. Apply dry sterile dressings to burn wounds [239]. Splint suspected fractures [239].\nProvide prompt transport [239].\nTaser injuries involve darts puncturing the skin [240]. Barbs are generally treated as impaled\nobjects [241]. They are removed by a physician [241]. EMTs may remove barbs in some\njurisdictions per protocol [241]. Potential complications exist with underlying disorders [242].\nExcited delirium is commonly associated with illegal drug ingestion [243]. Excited delirium is a\ntrue emergency and warrants advanced life support [243]. Taser use with excited delirium has\nbeen associated with dysrhythmias and cardiac arrest [245]. Have access to an AED when\nresponding to taser patients [245].\nRadiation burns are a potential threat [245]. Incidents relate to radioactive isotopes or terrorist\nattacks [245]. Determine if radiation exposure occurred and if it\u0027s ongoing [245]. There are three\ntypes of radiation: alpha, beta, and gamma [246]. Alpha has little penetrating injury [246]. Beta\nhas greater penetrating power [247]. Gamma is very penetrating [249]. It passes through the\nbody and solid materials [249]. Most accidents involve gamma rays or X-rays [250]. People\nexposed to radiation generally don\u0027t risk others [251]. In explosions, patients may be\ncontaminated [252]. Maintain a safe distance and wait for Hazmat for decon [252]. Most\ncontaminants are removed by removing clothes [253]. Once no threat exists, treat ABCs [253].\nNotify the emergency department [254]. Identify the source and duration of exposure [254].\nLimit your exposure duration [255]. Increase distance from the source [255]. Attempt to place\nshielding between you and the source [255].\n13. Dressings and Bandages\nDressings and bandages have three functions [256]. They control bleeding [256]. They prevent\nfurther wound damage [256]. They prevent further contamination and infection [256]. Sterile\ndressings are used for most wounds [257]. These include conventional sizes and small\nadhesive dressings [257]. Non-adherent roller dressings are also used [257]. The universal\ndressing is ideal for large open wounds [258]. Gauze pads are appropriate for smaller ones [258]\n. Adhesive dressings are useful for minor wounds [259]. Occlusive dressings prevent air and\nliquids from entering or exiting [259]. They are made from Vaseline gauze, aluminum foil, or\nplastic [260]. They cover sucking chest wounds or abdominal eviscerations [260]. They are also\nused for penetrating back wounds and neck injuries [260].\nTo keep dressings in place, use roller gauze, triangular bandages, tape, or self-adherence [261].\nSelf-adhering soft roller bandages are easiest to use [262]. Adhesive tape holds small\ndressings in place [263]. It helps secure larger dressings [263]. Some people are allergic to\nadhesive tape [264]. Use paper or plastic tape for these individuals [264]. Do not use elastic\nbandages to secure dressings [265]. If the injury swells, the bandage may become a tourniquet\n[265]. This can cause further damage [265]. Always check a limb distal to the bandage [266].\nCheck for signs of impaired circulation and loss of sensation [266]. Air splints and vacuum\nsplints stabilize broken extremities [267]. They can be used with dressings to control bleeding\n[267]. If a wound continues to bleed despite direct pressure, quickly use a tourniquet [268].\n14. Conclusion and Review\nIf a young man is struck in the forearm by a baseball [271]. He complains of pain and has slight\nswelling and ecchymosis [272]. There is no external bleeding [272]. This describes a contusion\n[273]. It is a contusion from blunt force trauma [274]. A severe compression injury cutting off\nblood flow below the injury is compartment syndrome [275].\nA 45-year-old clerk was shot in the right chest [276]. Blood is bubbling from the wound with\nevery breath [277]. The most immediate action is to put an occlusive dressing [278]. This\nprevents air from entering the wound [278]. This is a sucking chest wound [278]. Applying ice to\na hematoma will cause vasoconstriction [279]. This decreases bleeding [279].\nThe primary reason for applying a sterile dressing to an open injury is to control external\nbleeding [281]. While reducing infection risk is important, controlling bleeding is primary [280].\nThe most appropriate way to manage an open abdominal wound with protruding organs is\nusing a moist sterile dressing [282]. Secure it with an occlusive dressing [282]. Do not apply\npressure [283].\nA 22-year-old male is attacked with a knife in his chest [284]. He is not breathing and pulseless\n[284]. If a knife is present and interfering with CPR, carefully remove it [285]. Control the\nbleeding and begin CPR [285].\nSevere burns include full thickness burns involving hands, feet, or genitalia [287]. Burns of more\nthan 10% body surface area are also severe [287]. 5% or more can also be considered severe\n[288].\nA five-year-old boy pulled a barbecue grill on himself [289]. He has partial and full thickness\nburns to his anterior chest and both arms circumferentially [290]. Using the pediatric rule of\nnines, the anterior chest is 9% [292]. Each arm is 9% [292]. This totals 27% [292].\nRegarding chemical burns, it is false to remove a dry chemical after flushing with water [293].\nYou should brush off the dry chemical first, then flush [294].",

Review of Key Concepts A\n1. Introduction to Face and Neck Injuries\nThe face and neck are very vulnerable to injury [9].\nTheir position on the body is relatively unprotected [9].\nSoft tissue injuries and fractures are common [10].\nThese injuries can vary in severity [10].\nSome injuries are life-threatening [11].\nAn example is penetrating trauma to the neck [11].\nThis type of injury may cause severe bleeding [11].\nAn open injury may allow an air embolism to enter the circulatory system [11].\nUnderstanding the anatomy and physiology of these areas is important [12].\nThis report covers managing trauma related issues with the face and neck [2]\n.\nIt also helps in recognizing life threats associated with these emergencies [3].\nThe correlation with head and spinal trauma is also discussed [3].\n2.

Patient Assessment for Face and Neck Injuries\nScene safety is the highest priority in patient assessment [80].\nAssess for potential violence or environmental hazards [80].\nStandard precautions include eye protection and a face mask [81].\nThis is due to the potential for projectile blood [81].\nDetermine the number of patients and consider additional resources [82].\nThe mechanism of injury (MOI) is very important [83].\nAssess the scene for indicators of the MOI [84].\nCommon MOIs include motor vehicle collisions, sports falls, penetrating\ntrauma, and blunt trauma [85].\nThe primary assessment focuses on identifying life-threatening concerns\n[86].\nThreats to X, A, B, C\u0027s must be treated immediately [86].\nLife-threatening external hemorrhage should be addressed before airway\nand breathing [86].\nForm a general impression to gauge the patient\u0027s condition seriousness [87].\nInjuries may be obvious or hidden [88].\nControl blood loss with direct pressure [89].\nConsider the need for spinal immobilization [89].\nCheck responsiveness using the AVPU scale [89].\nEnsure a clear and patent airway [90].\nConsider an oral pharyngeal airway if the patient is unresponsive [91].\nQuickly assess the adequacy of breathing [92].\nSplinting or restricting chest wall motion is contraindicated [93].\nAssess the pulse and quality (Circulation) [95].\nSignificant bleeding is an immediate life threat [95].\nMake a transport decision (D) [96].\nQuickly transport patients with airway/breathing problems or significant\nbleeding [96].\nStabilization may be difficult [97].\nConsider advanced life support backup if transport is long [98].\nPatients with internal bleeding need rapid transport [99].\nSigns of hypoperfusion imply the need for rapid transport [100].\nPatients with a significant MOI appearing stable should also be transported\npromptly [101].\nA significant blow to the face or throat increases suspicion of spinal or brain\ninjury [102].\nEven without signs of hypoperfusion or other life-threatening injuries,\nsuspicion should be high [102].\nThere is a possibility of eye injuries [103].\nIn history taking, investigate the chief complaint and obtain medical history\n[103].\nBe alert for injury specific signs and symptoms [103].\nBe aware of pertinent negatives [103].\nGet a SAMPLE history [104].\nAttempt to gather history from friends or family if the patient is unresponsive\n[104].\nIn unresponsive patients, only signs of injuries are noticeable [105].\nFor the secondary assessment, if multiple systems are affected, start with an\nentire body assessment [105].\nLook for decap btls [105].\nDo not delay transport to complete a thorough physical exam in certain\npatients [105].\nConsider focusing the physical exam in responsive patients with isolated\ninjuries [106].\nEnsure control of bleeding is maintained [106].\nNote the location of the injury [106].\nInspect the wound for foreign matter and stabilize objects [107].\nUse both eyes and hands [108].\nExplain the examination process to a responsive patient [109].\nAssess all underlying systems [109].\nWhen evaluating the eyes, start with outer aspects and work towards the\npupils [110].\nvisual acuity is considered the vital sign of the eye [111].\nAssess and maintain baseline vital signs [112].\nObserve for any changes during treatment [112].\nBe concerned with visible and unseen bleeding [113].\nBaseline information about respirations and pulse is important [114].\nUse monitoring devices and perform reassessment [114].\nRepeat the primary assessment, reassess vital signs and chief complaint [115].\nContinually reassess the adequacy of airway, breathing, and circulation [115].\nRecheck patient interventions [116].\nReassessment is particularly important in facial/neck injuries [116].\nPatient condition should be reassessed at least every 5 minutes [116].\n5. Emergency Medical Care for Face and Neck Injuries\nInjury Type Key Emergency Care Interventions Source\nGeneral Care Complete spinal immobilization if suspected\nspinal injuries; Maintain open airway; Prepare to\nsuction; Consider oral/nasal airway; Provide\nhigh-flow oxygen; Control significant visual\nbleeding; Treat for shock if hypoperfusion\nsigns; Rapid transport if seriously injured.\n[117]\nSoft Tissue\nInjuries\nAssess X ABC\u0027s and life threats first; Follow\nstandard precautions; Open and clear airway\n(avoid neck movement if cervical injury\nsuspected); Control bleeding with direct\npressure and sterile dressing; Do not apply\nexcessive pressure if skull fracture suspected;\nCover exposed structures with moist sterile\ndressing; Apply ice to injuries that do not break\nskin; Check for bleeding inside the mouth; Save\navulsed skin wrapped in sterile dressing and\nkeep cool; Place loose skin flaps close to\nnormal position.\n[123]\nEye - Foreign\nObjects\nIrrigate with sterile saline solution; For objects\non the eyelid, remove with a moist, cottontipped\napplicator; For impaled objects, stabilize\nand transport, bandage both eyes.\n[137]\nEye - Burns Stop the burn and prevent further damage; For\nchemical burns, flush with water or sterile\nsolution continuously (20+ mins for strong\nacids/alkaloids); Apply clean dry dressing and\ncover eye; For thermal burns, cover both eyes\nwith sterile dressing moistened with saline; For\nlight burns, cover each eye with sterile moist\npad and eye shield.\n[143]\nEye - Lacerations If globe laceration, apply no pressure; Gently\napply moist sterile dressing; Cover with a\nprotective metal shield, cup, or sterile dressing;\nApply soft dressing to both eyes; If eyeball\ndislodged, do not reposition, cover and\nstabilize with moist sterile dressing, cover both\neyes, keep patient supine.\n[156]\nEye - Blunt\nTrauma\nProtect injured eye with metal shield; Cover the\nother eye to minimize movement.\n[164]\nEye - Blast\nInjuries\nManagement depends on severity.\n[169]\nEye - Contact\nLenses/Artificial\nEyes\nGenerally do not remove (except chemical\nburns); Remove hard lenses with suction cup;\nRemove soft lenses by pinching gently after\nadding saline; Place lenses in saline and advise\nhospital; Care for artificial eye like a normal one.\n[171]\nNosebleeds\n(Epistaxis)\nFor non-trauma patient bleeding heavily, place\nin sitting position leaning forward and pinch\nnostrils; For trauma-related bleeding, apply\nsterile dressing.\n[183]\nEar Injuries Apply local pressure to control bleeding; If\nsevere ear avulsion, wrap avulsed part in moist\nsterile dressing, place in labeled plastic bag; Do\nnot remove foreign objects from the ear canal;\nDo not try to manipulate foreign bodies.\n[187]\nFacial Fractures Remove and save loose teeth or bone\nfragments from the mouth; Remove loose\ndentures and dental bridges to protect airway;\nSwelling can be a source of obstruction.\n[196]\nDental Injuries Apply direct pressure to stop bleeding from\ndisplaced teeth; Perform suctioning if needed;\nSave and transport avulsed tooth by the crown;\nPlace tooth in storage solution, milk, or sterile\nsaline.\n[200]\nCheek Injuries If unable to control bleeding compromising\nairway, consider removing the object; Provide\ndirect pressure on both sides (inside and out);\nBandaging should not occlude the mouth.\n[202]\nNeck Injuries\n(Blunt Trauma)\nMaintain airway; Immediately transport;\nConsider advanced life support early; Consider\nspinal motion restriction.\n[207]\nNeck Injuries\n(Penetrating\nTrauma)\nDirect pressure over the bleeding site; Assess\nfor signs of shock; Immediate spinal motion\nrestriction if indicated; Apply high-flow oxygen;\nDo not remove penetrating or impaled objects\nunless interfering with CPR; Stabilize all\nimpaled objects if not obstructing airway.\n[213]\nLaryngeal\nInjuries\nMaintain airway; Immediately transport;\nConsider advanced life support early; Consider\nspinal motion restriction; Do not remove\npenetrating or impaled objects unless\ninterfering with CPR; Stabilize impaled objects\nif not obstructing airway; Provide oxygen and\n[207]\nventilate; Keep patient supine; Avoid use of a\nrigid collar.\n6. Complications and Considerations\nInjuries to the face and neck can frequently cause airway obstruction [65].\nSeveral factors can contribute to this obstruction [65].\nThese include blood clots from heavy facial bleeding [66].\nDirect injuries to the nose, mouth, larynx, and trachea can cause bleeding\nand respiratory compromise [66].\nDislodged teeth or dentures can become an airway obstruction [67].\nSwelling from soft tissue injury can also cause obstruction [68].\nAirway can be affected by turning the patient\u0027s head [69].\nBrain and cervical spine injuries may interfere with normal respirations [69].\nFacial fractures also carry the danger of blood clots obstructing the airway\n[195].\nSwelling can be extreme within 24 hours after injury [198].\nA life-threatening complication is an air embolism [11].\nThis may result from an open injury allowing air into the circulatory system\n[12].\nIt can occur if a vein has been punctured in the neck [211].\nRapid transport is crucial for certain patients [96].\nThis includes patients with airway or breathing problems or significant\nbleeding [96].\nPatients with internal bleeding must be transported quickly [99].\nSigns of hypoperfusion imply the need for rapid transport [100].\nEven patients appearing stable but with a significant MOI should be\ntransported promptly [101].\nAdvanced life support (ALS) should be considered [98].\nThis is important if transport is too long [98].\nConsider ALS early for neck injuries [208].\n7.

Introduction to Head and Spine Injuries\nThis chapter focuses on head and spine injuries [1].\nUnderstanding this material helps manage trauma-related issues [2].\nIt is crucial to recognize life threats from these injuries [3].\nImmediate spinal stabilization is essential [3].\nAirway and breathing support may also be needed [3].\n2. Anatomy and Physiology of the Nervous System\nSystem Components Protection Functions\nCentral\nNervous\nBrain, Spinal cord [16] Skull, Bony\nspinal canal\n[11], Meninges\nControls body, Center of\nconsciousness, Carries\nmessages between\nbrain and body [17]\nPeripheral 31 pairs of spinal\nnerves, 12 pairs of\ncranial nerves, Sensory\nnerves, Motor nerves,\nConnecting nerves [36]\nNone\nspecified\nConducts impulses,\nTransports information\ndirectly to/from brain,\nPerforms special\nfunctions [37]\nThe nervous system is a complex network of nerve cells [9].\nIt includes the brain, spinal cord, nerve fibers, and nerves [10].\nThe nervous system is well protected by bony structures [11].\nSerious injuries can damage the nervous system despite this protection [12].\nThe central nervous system includes the brain and spinal cord [16].\nThe brain controls the body [17].\nIt is the center of consciousness [17].\nThe brain is divided into three major areas: cerebrum, cerebellum, and\nbrainstem [18].\nThe cerebrum controls voluntary motor function and conscious\nthought [20].\nThe cerebellum coordinates balance and body movements [22].\nThe brain stem controls most functions necessary for life [23].\nThis includes cardiac and respiratory systems [23].\nIt is the best protected part of the central nervous system [24].\nThe spinal cord carries messages between the brain and body [25].\nThe central nervous system is protected by the meninges [27].\nThese are three layers of tissues [27].\nThe outer layer, dura mater, is a tough, fibrous sac [28].\nThe inner two layers, arachnoid mater and pia mater, contain blood\nvessels [29].\nCerebral spinal fluid (CSF) is produced inside the brain [31].\nIt is produced in the third ventricle [32].\nCSF acts primarily as a shock absorber [33].\nClear, watery CSF may leak from the nose, ears, or an open skull fracture if\nprotective layers are penetrated [34].\nThe peripheral nervous system has spinal nerves and cranial nerves [36].\nSpinal nerves conduct impulses to and from the spinal cord [37].\nCranial nerves transport information directly to or from the brain [40].\nCranial nerves perform special functions in the head and face [41].\nThere are two types of peripheral nerves: sensory and motor [42].\nSensory nerves carry information from the body to the brain [44].\nMotor nerves carry information from the central nervous system to the\nmuscles [45].\nConnecting nerves are found in the brain and spinal cord [46].\nThey connect sensory and motor nerves [46].\nThe nervous system controls reflex activities, voluntary activities, and\ninvoluntary activities [48].\nA reflex arc in the spinal cord allows simple messages to bypass the brain\n[49].\nThe somatic nervous system handles voluntary activities [52].\nThe autonomic nervous system handles involuntary functions [53].\nThe autonomic system is divided into sympathetic and parasympathetic\ndivisions [54].\nThe sympathetic system reacts to stress with the fight or flight response\n[56].\nThe parasympathetic system has opposite effects, such as slowing heart\nrate [57].\nThese divisions balance each other for homeostasis [58].\n3. Skeletal Structures Protecting the Nervous System\nThe skeletal system includes the skull and the spinal cord [61].\nThe skull is composed of cranial and facial bones [61].\nThe brain connects to the spinal cord through the foramen magnum [62].\nFour major bones make up the cranium: occipital, temporal, parietal, and\nfrontal [63].\nThe face is composed of 14 bones, including the maxilla, zygoma,\nmandible, nasal, and frontal [64].\nThe spinal cord is the body\u0027s central supporting structure [66].\nIt has 33 vertebrae [67].\nThese are divided into five sections: cervical, thoracic, lumbar, sacral, and\ncoccygeal [68].\nThe front part of each vertebrae is the vertebral body [70].\nThe back forms a bony arch [70].\nThe series of arches forms the spinal canal [71].\nThe spinal canal protects the spinal cord [71].\nVertebrae are connected by ligaments and separated by intervertebral\ndiscs [72].\n4. Head Injuries: Types, Mechanisms, and Signs\nAspect Description\nDefinition Traumatic insult to the head [74]\nImpact May injure soft tissue, bony structures, or the brain [74] accounts\nfor over half of traumatic deaths [75]\nTypes Closed head injury, Open head injury [78]\nMechanisms Falls, Motor vehicle crashes, Assaults, Sports related incidents [81]\nGeneral\nSigns\nVarious signs listed in a table [83]\nA head injury is a traumatic insult to the head [74].\nIt can injure soft tissue, bony structures, or the brain [74].\nHead injuries account for over half of all traumatic deaths [75].\nFatal injuries always involve the brain [76].\nBe aware of additional trauma the patient may have [77].\nThere are generally two types of head injuries: closed and open [78].\nIn closed head injuries, the brain is injured, but there is no opening [79].\nAn open head injury has an opening to the outside world [80].\nThis is often caused by penetrating trauma [80].\nBrain tissue may be exposed [80].\nCommon mechanisms of injury include falls and motor vehicle crashes [81].\nOther mechanisms include assaults and sports incidents [82].\nGeneral signs and symptoms are shown in a table [83].\n5.

rapidly increase\nintracranial pressure (ICP) [109].\nIncreased ICP squeezes the brain against the skull [110].\nSigns of increased ICP include:\nAbnormal respiratory patterns (ataxic, Cheyne-Stokes) [111]\nDecreased pulse rate [111]\nHeadache, nausea, vomiting [111]\nDecreased alertness [111]\nBradycardia [112]\nSluggish or non-reactive pupils [112]\nCerebral posturing [112]\nIncreased or widened blood pressures [112]\nCushing\u0027s reflex is a triad of symptoms indicating increased ICP [112].\nIt consists of increased systolic blood pressure, decreased pulse rate,\nand irregular respirations [113].\nIntracranial hemorrhage is bleeding inside the skull [113].\nThis usually increases ICP [113].\nBleeding can occur in different locations: between the skull and dura\nmater, beneath the dura mater but outside the brain, or within the brain\ntissue itself [114].\nAn epidural hematoma is blood accumulation between the skull and dura\nmater [115].\nIt usually results from a blow to the head causing a linear fracture of the\ntemporal bone [115].\nIt is nearly always due to arterial bleeding [115].\nSymptoms progress rapidly [115].\nThe patient often loses consciousness immediately, followed by a brief\nlucid interval, then lapses back into unconsciousness [116].\nThe pupil on the side of the hematoma becomes fixed and dilated [118].\nDeath occurs rapidly without surgery [118].\nA subdural hematoma is blood accumulation beneath the dura mater, outside\nthe brain [119].\nIt usually happens after falls or injuries with strong deceleration forces [120]\n.\nIt is more common than epidural hematomas [120].\nIt may or may not be associated with a skull fracture [120].\nIt is linked to a venous bleed [121].\nSigns typically develop more gradually than with epidural hematomas [121].\nThe patient often has a fluctuating level of consciousness or slurred\nspeech [122].\nAn intracerebral hematoma involves bleeding within the brain itself [124].\nIt can occur after a penetrating head injury or rapid deceleration forces\n[124].\nMany small, deep hemorrhages are associated with other brain injuries\n[125].\nThe progression of increased ICP depends on other injuries, the brain\nregion, and the size of the hemorrhage [126].\nIntracerebral hematomas have a high mortality rate [127].\nThis is true even if the hematoma is surgically removed [127].\nA subarachnoid hemorrhage is bleeding in the subarachnoid space [127].\nThis is where CSF circulates [127].\nIt results in bloody CSF and signs of meningeal irritation [127].\nNeck rigidity or headache are signs of meningeal irritation [127].\nCommon causes include trauma or a ruptured aneurysm [128].\nPatients report a sudden severe headache [129].\nAs bleeding increases, signs of increased ICP appear [130].\nA sudden severe subarachnoid hemorrhage usually results in death [131].\nSurvivors often have permanent neurologic impairment [132].\n7. Concussions and Contusions\nA concussion is a blow to the head or face [133].\nIt is classified as a mild traumatic brain injury [133].\nIt is a closed injury [134].\nThere is temporary loss or alteration of brain function [134].\nThere is no demonstrable physical damage to the brain [134].\nAbout 90% of patients with a concussion do not lose consciousness [135].\nA patient may be confused or have amnesia [136].\nRetrograde amnesia is the inability to remember events leading up to the\ninjury [137].\nAnterograde amnesia is the inability to remember the events of the injury\n[137].\nUsually, a concussion lasts only a short time [138].\nAsk about symptoms like dizziness, weakness, visual changes, or mood\nchanges [138].\nAdditional signs include nausea, vomiting, ringing in the ear, slurred\nspeech, and inability to focus [139].\nAssume a patient with concussion signs has a more serious injury until\nproven otherwise [140].\nA contusion is bruising of the brain tissue [140].\nIt results from blunt trauma [140].\nA contusion is far more serious than a concussion [141].\nIt involves physical injury to the brain tissue [142].\nIt may cause long-lasting or permanent damage [142].\nPatients with a brain contusion may show all signs of a brain injury [143].\n8. Non-Traumatic Brain Injuries\nBrain injuries can also come from medical conditions [144].\nThese include blood clots or hemorrhages [144].\nProblems with blood vessels or high blood pressure can cause spontaneous\nbleeding [144].\nSigns and symptoms of a non-traumatic injury are often the same as\ntraumatic brain injury [145].\n9. Spinal Injuries: Mechanisms and Findings\nThe cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine can be injured in many ways [146].\nCompression injuries can result from a fall [147].\nThis is true regardless of how the patient landed [147].\nForces can compress the vertebrae bodies [148].\nThis can cause disc herniation and compression on the spinal cord [148].\nFragmentation into the spinal canal is possible [148].\nMotor vehicle crashes can overextend or hyperflex the cervical spine [149].\nThis can damage ligaments and joints [149].\nRotation flexion injuries result from rapid acceleration forces [150].\nAny unnatural motion can result in a fracture or neurological deficit [151].\nHyperextension occurs when the spine is pulled along its length [152].\nThis can cause fractures, ligament, and muscle injuries [152].\nWhen spine bones are altered by trauma, they can fracture or move [153].\nPermanent damage may occur [154].\nCommon findings include pain and tenderness on palpation [155].\nTake extra precautions when stabilizing the spine if these injuries are\nsuspected [155].\n10. Patient Assessment for Head and Spine Injuries\nStep Focus Key Actions\nRecognizing\nMOI\nIdentify\nmechanisms\nsuggestive of\nhead or spinal\ninjury [156]\nSuspect injury in motor vehicle collisions\n(especially motorcycles, snowmobiles, ATVs),\npedestrian/vehicle collisions, falls (\u003e20 ft\nadult, \u003e10 ft pediatric), blunt trauma,\npenetrating trauma to head/back/torso, rapid\ndeceleration, hangings, axial loading, diving\naccidents [156]\nScene Sizeup\nEnsure scene\nsafety and\nidentify hazards\n[157]\nEvaluate for hazards [157] Be prepared with\nstandard precautions [157] Call for ALS early in\nMVC [157] Consider the mechanism of injury to\npredict likely injuries [158]\nPrimary\nAssessment\nIdentify and\nmanage lifethreatening\nconcerns [160]\nFocus on threats to circulation, airway, and\nbreathing [161] Treat life threats immediately\n[161] Recognize critical patients quickly [162]\nReduce on-scene time for critical patients [162]\nIncrease survival chance or reduce damage for\ncritical patients [162]\nAlways suspect a possible head or spinal cord injury with certain mechanisms\nof injury [156].\nMechanisms suggesting injury include:\nMotor vehicle collisions, especially motorcycles, snowmobiles, and ATVs\n[156]\nPedestrian or motor vehicle collisions [156]\nFalls greater than 20 feet for adults or 10 feet for pediatrics [156]\nBlunt trauma [156]\nPenetrating trauma to the head, back, or torso [157]\nRapid deceleration injuries [157]\nHangings [157]\nAxial loading injuries [157]\nDiving accidents [157]\nDuring scene size-up, ensure the scene is safe [157].\nEvaluate the scene for hazards to your health, your team, or bystanders [157].\nUse appropriate standard precautions [157].\nCall for advanced life support (ALS) as soon as possible in motor vehicle\ncrashes [157].\nConsider how the mechanism of injury might have produced the expected\ninjuries [158].\nThe primary assessment focuses on identifying and managing lifethreatening\nconcerns [160].\nThreats to circulation, airway, and breathing are life-threatening [161].\nThey must be treated immediately [161].\nReducing on-scene time and recognizing critical patients increases survival\nchances [162].\nThis can also reduce irreversible damage [162].\n11. Spinal Immobilization Considerations\nBe aware that any unnecessary patient movement can cause additional\ninjuries [163].\nAssess the scene first to determine the risk of injury [164].\nForm a general impression of the patient based on their level of\nconsciousness and chief complaint [164].\nConsider not using spinal restriction if the patient is clear-thinking [165].\nThis is also true if they have no neurological deficits or spinal\npain/tenderness [165].\nConsider this if there is no evidence of intoxication or other conditions\nmasking spinal injury [165].\nThe backboard is rigid and can place the patient in an incorrect position [166].\nCirculation to skin areas may be compromised [167].\nSome patients may have respiratory compromise laying flat [167].\nMinimize the time a patient is on a backboard [167].\nApply a cervical collar after assessing airway and breathing [168].\nProvide necessary treatments before applying the collar [168].\nOnce the cervical collar is on, do not move it unless it causes problems [169].\nProblems include difficulty maintaining the airway [169].\nSigns of increasing ICP are another reason to remove it [169].\nIf the device must be removed, maintain manual stabilization of the cervical\nspine [170].\nKeep manual stabilization until the collar can be replaced [170].\n12. Assessing for Signs and Symptoms\nAsk the responsive patient specific questions [171].\nAsk what happened [171].\nAsk where it hurts [171].\nAsk if their neck or back hurts [171].\nAsk if they can move their hands and feet [171].\nAsk if they hit their head [171].\nConfused or slurred speech can indicate a head injury [171].\nRepetitive questioning or amnesia also suggest head injury in responsive\npatients [171].\nIn trauma, assume a head injury until proven otherwise [172].\nDecreased blood glucose levels can mimic these symptoms [173].\nPatients with a decreased level of responsiveness should be considered to\nhave a spinal cord injury [173].\nThis consideration is based on their chief complaint [173].\n13. Airway, Breathing, and Circulation Management\nIf spinal injury is suspected, open and assess the airway [174].\nManually hold the patient\u0027s head still while assessing the airway [175].\nUse the jaw-thrust maneuver to open the airway [176].\nIf jaw-thrust is ineffective, the head-tilt, chin-lift is a last resort [177].\nVomiting can occur in patients with a head injury [178].\nIrregular breathing, like Cheyne-Stokes, may result from increased ICP [179].\nAdminister high flow oxygen to patients with head and spinal injuries [180].\nPulse oximetry values should ideally be 95 or higher [181].\nThey should not fall below 90 [181].\nAvoid hyperventilation (ventilating too fast or with too much force) [182].\nUse hyperventilation only when capnography is available [182].\nEnsure an end tidal CO2 between 30 to 35 during hyperventilation [182].\nA pulse that is too slow in a head injury patient can indicate a serious\ncondition [183].\nA single episode of hypoperfusion can lead to significant brain damage or\ndeath [184].\nAssess for signs and symptoms of shock and treat appropriately [184].\nControl bleeding [185].\n14. Transport Considerations\nThe manner of transport is important for trauma patients [186].\nKeep several transport considerations in mind for head trauma patients [187].\nPatients with impaired airways, open head wounds, or abnormal vital signs\nmay need rapid extrication [187].\nPatients who do not respond to painful stimuli also need rapid extrication and\ntransport [187].\nEnsuring a patient\u0027s airway is paramount [188].\nProviding high flow oxygen is also paramount [188].\nThere is a probability of vomiting and seizures [189].\nSuction should be readily available [189].\nA head trauma patient may deteriorate rapidly [190].\nThey may require air medical transport [191].\nIn supine patients, the head should be elevated 30 degrees if possible [192].\nThis helps with ICP [192].\nRemember to maintain immobilization of the spine [193].\n15. History Taking and Secondary Assessment\nInvestigate the chief complaint during history taking [194].\nObtain a medical history [194].\nBe alert for injury-specific signs and symptoms [194].\nAlso look for any pertinent negatives [194].\nIf the patient is not responsive, try to get history from other sources [195].\nThese include friends, family members, or medical identification [195].\nCheck cards in wallets [195].\nMake every attempt to get a SAMPLE history [196].\nIn the secondary assessment, the ability to move extremities or feel\nsensations does not rule out spinal injury [196].\nAbsence of pain also does not necessarily rule out spinal injury [196].\nInstruct the patient to keep still and not move their head or neck [197].\nPerform a physical exam, which can be systematic or focused [198].\nPerform a secondary assessment en route if time permits [199].\nObtain a complete set of vital signs [200].\nVital signs are essential in addition to hands-on assessment [200].\nUse monitoring devices to quantify oxygen and circulatory status [201].\nMaintain end tidal CO2 between 35 and 40 [201].\nMaintain an SPO2 above 94 [201].\nUse the DCAP-BTLS exam to examine the head, chest, abdomen,\nextremities, and back [202].\nCheck perfusion, motor function, and sensation in all extremities before\nmoving the patient [202].\nA decreased level of consciousness is the most reliable sign of head injury\n[203].\nDetermine if there is decreased movement or numbness/tingling in\nextremities [203].\nLook for blood or CSF leaking from the ears, mouth, or nose [204].\nAlso look for bruising around the eyes or behind the ears [204].\nAssess pupil size and reaction to light [204].\nContinue to monitor the pupils [204].\nDo not probe open scalp lacerations with a gloved finger [205].\nThis may push bone fragments into the brain [205].\nDo not remove an impaled object from an open head injury [205].\n16. Neurologic and Spine Examination\nExamination\nType\nAssessment\nFocus\nTechniques / Findings Score/Scale\nNeurologic\nExam\nBaseline\nassessment of\nconsciousness\nlevels [206]\nAssess level of\nconsciousness [206] Record\nfluctuating or deteriorating\nlevels [208]\nGlasgow Coma\nScale (GCS)\n[206] Revised\nTrauma Score\n(RTS) if used\n[207]\nSpine Exam Inspect and\npalpate the\nspine, assess for\nimpairment [209]\nInspect for DCAP-BTLS [209]\nCheck extremities for\ncirculation [209] Note the level\nof impairment [209] Palpate\nfor pain or tenderness [210]\nLook for obvious deformity,\nnumbness, weakness,\ntingling, soft tissue\nemergencies [211] Observe for\nobvious injuries to head/neck\nsuggesting cervical spine\ninjury [212]\nNone specified\nPerform a baseline neurologic examination using the Glasgow Coma Scale\n(GCS) [206].\nIf your jurisdiction uses the Revised Trauma Score (RTS), use GCS findings for\nRTS [207].\nRecord levels of consciousness that fluctuate or deteriorate [208].\nThe GCS categories are shown in a table [208].\nPerform a spine exam [209].\nInspect for DCAP-BTLS [209].\nCheck the extremities for circulation [209].\nIf impairment is present, note the level [209].\nPain or tenderness on palpation is a warning sign of possible spine injury [210].\nOther signs include obvious deformity [211].\nNumbness, weakness, or tingling of the extremities are also signs [211].\nSoft tissue emergencies in the spinal region may be present [211].\nObvious injuries to the head or neck may indicate injury to the cervical spine\n[212].\n17. Reassessment and Interventions\nRepeat the primary assessment during reassessment [213].\nReassess signs and symptoms and the chief complaint [213].\nRecheck the patient\u0027s interventions [213].\nReassess the patient\u0027s condition at least every five minutes [214].\nRapid deterioration of neurologic signs after a head injury is a sign of\nexpanding hematoma [215].\nIt can also indicate rapidly progressing brain swelling [215].\nIf CSF is present, cover the wound with sterile gauze [216].\nThis prevents further contamination [216].\nDo not bandage it tightly [216].\nYour protocol should include administering high-flow O2 [217].\nApply a cervical collar if indicated as part of spinal immobilization [217].\nReassessment should occur as the patient is transported [218].\nTransport to an appropriate trauma facility [218].\n18. Communication and Documentation\nProvide complete and detailed information to the destination facility [219].\nAdvanced warning helps hospitals prepare for seriously injured patients [220].\nDescribe the most serious problems found during assessment [220].\nMore seriously injured patients should be documented [221].\nDocument their vital signs every five minutes [221].\nFor more stable patients, document vital signs every 15 minutes [222].\nYou may be asked to testify as a witness [223].\nBe sure to properly document [223].\n19. Emergency Care for Head Injuries\nThere are three general principles for head injury emergency care [225].\nThese principles protect and maintain critical functions of the central nervous\nsystem [225].\nYou need to establish an adequate airway [226].\nControl bleeding [226].\nProvide adequate circulation to maintain cerebral perfusion [226].\nAssess the patient\u0027s baseline level of consciousness [227].\nContinuously monitor the level of consciousness [227].\nThe most important step is establishing and maintaining an adequate airway\n[227].\nOnce the airway is open, maintain the head and cervical spine in a neutral\ninline position [228].\nKeep this position until a cervical collar is placed [228].\nAlso keep this position until the patient is secured on the backboard [228].\nRemove any foreign body secretions or vomit from the airway [230].\nCheck ventilation after clearing the airway [230].\nGive supplemental oxygen to any patient with a suspected head injury [231].\nThis is especially important for anyone having trouble breathing [231].\nUse a BVM to assist ventilations if the patient is breathing too slow or shallow\n[232].\nPlacement of an airway device may be necessary [232].\nConsider calling for ALS if the patient\u0027s airway is compromised [233].\nBegin CPR if the patient is in cardiac arrest [234].\nActive blood loss can aggravate hypoxia [235].\nBleeding inside the skull may cause ICP to rise to life-threatening levels [235].\nBleeding from a scalp laceration can almost always be controlled with direct\npressure [237].\nIf a skull fracture is suspected, do not apply excessive pressure to the wound\n[238].\nIf a dressing becomes soaked, do not remove it [239].\nPlace a second dressing over the first [239].\nShock is usually due to hypovolemia from bleeding from other injuries [240].\nTransport immediately to a trauma center [240].\nCushing\u0027s triad indicates increased intracranial pressure [241].\nIt includes increased blood pressure (hypertension) [241].\nIt also includes decreased heart rate (bradycardia) [241].\nFinally, it includes irregular respirations [242].\nIf Cushing\u0027s triad continues, it is fatal [242].\nManage shock [243].\nAdminister oxygen [243].\nVentilate as necessary [243].\nAvoid hyperventilation [243].\n20. Emergency Care for Spinal Injuries\nRemember to follow standard precautions [245].\nMaintain the patient\u0027s airway while keeping the spine in the proper position\n[245].\nAssess respirations and give supplemental oxygen if needed [246].\nManually manage the airway using the jaw thrust maneuver [246].\nConsider inserting an OPA [247].\nHave a suction unit available [247].\nProvide supplemental oxygen if needed [247].\nFor spinal motion restriction of the cervical spine, immobilize the head and\ntrunk [248].\nThis prevents bone fragments from causing further damage [248].\nEven small movements can cause significant injury [249].\nNever force the head into a neutral position [250].\nDo not move the head further if the patient reports certain symptoms [250].\nThese symptoms include muscle spasms [250].\nIncreased pain, numbness, tingling, or weakness in arms/legs are also reasons\nnot to move the head [250].\nA compromised airway or ventilations also mean not moving the head [250].\nIn these situations, stabilize the patient in their current position [250].\n21. Spinal Immobilization Devices and Techniques\nCervical collars provide preliminary partial support [251].\nThey should be applied to every patient with a possible spinal injury [252].\nThis is based on mechanism of injury, history, or signs/symptoms [252].\nA rigid cervical collar must be the correct size to be effective [252].\nAfter manual head/neck stabilization, assess pulse, motor functions, and\nsensations in all extremities [253].\nThen assess the spinal cord area and neck [253].\nMaintain manual support until the patient is fully secured to the backboard or\nvacuum mattress [254].\nFor supine patients, secure the patient to the long backboard [254].\nProcedures to move patients from the ground include a four-person log roll\n[255].\nYou may also slide the patient onto the backboard or vacuum mattress [256].\nThe vacuum mattress is an alternative to the long backboard [257].\nIt molds to the body contours, reducing pressure points and providing\ncomfort [257].\nIt also provides thermal insulation [258].\nIt is excellent for the elderly or patients with abnormal spinal curvature [259].\nIts thickness requires careful movement to maintain C-spine [260].\nIt cannot be used for patients over 350 pounds [261].\nIt cannot be used on spine sitting or standing patients [261].\nPatients can be moved onto it with a scoop stretcher or log roll [262].\nFor sitting patients, use a short board or other extrication device [263].\nThis restricts movement of the cervical and thoracic spine [263].\nThen secure the short backboard to the long backboard [263].\nExceptions include dangerous situations requiring immediate access to others\n[264].\nAnother exception is when injuries justify urgent removal [264].\nA standing patient should gently sit down [267].\nThen transfer them to a position where spinal motion restriction can be\nmaintained [267].\nIf mechanism or clinical signs suggest spinal injury, establish spinal motion\nrestriction [268].\nClinical indications include spinal tenderness or pain [269].\nAltered level of consciousness or neurologic deficits are indicators [269].\nObvious anatomic deformity to the spine or high energy trauma in intoxicated\npatients are also indicators [269].\nPain may be missed due to shock or attention on other painful areas [270].\nAssume spinal injury in all patients with a head injury [270].\nThis is because manipulating an unstable cervical spine can cause permanent\ndamage [270].\nUse manual inline stabilization or a cervical collar and long backboard [271].\nA short backboard is designed to immobilize the head, neck, and torso [274].\nIt is used for non-critical seated patients with possible spinal injuries [275].\nLong backboards provide full body stabilization [276].\nThey are used to immobilize patients found in any position [277].\n22. Helmet Removal\nA well-fitting helmet should be left on if it prevents head movement [279].\nThis is true if there are no airway or breathing problems [279].\nIt should not interfere with airway/ventilation assessment and treatment\n[280].\nYou must be able to properly immobilize the spine [280].\nRemove the helmet if it is a full-face helmet [281].\nRemove it if it makes assessing or managing airway problems difficult [281].\nRemove it if removing the face guard is not possible to improve airway access\n[281].\nRemove it if it prevents proper spine immobilization [281].\nAlso remove it if it allows excessive head movement [282].\nRemove the helmet if the patient is in cardiac arrest [282].\nThe preferred removal method requires at least two people [283].\nThe technique depends on the helmet type [284].\nYou and your partner should not move at the same time [285].\nConsult medical control about the decision to remove the helmet [285].\nAn alternate method allows removal with less force [287].\nThis reduces the likelihood of neck motion [287].\nThe disadvantage is that it is slightly more time consuming [288].\nSteps for the alternate method include removing the chin strap and face mask\n[289].\nPop the jaw pads out of place [289].\nPlace your finger inside the helmet during removal [289].\nOne person controls the head by holding the jaw and occiput [289].\nInsert padding behind the occiput to prevent neck extension [290].\nThe person at the chest is responsible for ensuring head and neck do not\nmove [291].\nSmall children may need extra padding for inline stabilization [292].\n23. Review Questions and Conclusion\nReview questions cover key concepts from the chapter [294].\nThe central nervous system parts are cerebrum, cerebellum, brain stem\n[294].\nBlood loss from scalp lacerations contributes to hypovolemic shock [296].\nImmediate loss of consciousness followed by a lucid interval suggests an\nepidural hematoma [297].\nA patient struck in the head who was briefly unconscious, has a headache\nand sees stars, and regained memory has a concussion [298].\nNo memory of events leading up to an accident is retrograde amnesia [300]\n.\nMemory of the actual event is anterograde amnesia [302].\nA distraction injury to the cervical spine is likely from a hanging\nmechanism [303].\nManual stabilization of the head must be maintained until a patient with\npossible spinal injury is fully immobilized [304].\nFor a semi-conscious patient with face and head trauma, blood in the\nmouth, and snoring sounds, manually stabilize the head, log roll, and\nsuction [305].\nFor an unconscious patient slumped over a steering wheel with head\nturned and neck flexed, manually stabilize and move into a neutral inline\nposition [308].\nDo not remove an injured football player\u0027s helmet if the face guard can be\neasily removed and there\u0027s no airway compromise [309].\nThis concludes the lecture on head and spine injuries [310].",

Introduction to Chest Injuries\nchest trauma results in over 1.2 million emergency department visits annually\n[6].\nThese injuries can affect the heart, lungs, and great vessels [7].\nThey can be caused by blunt trauma, penetrating trauma, or both [7].\nEMTs must immediately treat any injuries that interfere with normal breathing\n[8].\nInternal bleeding can accumulate, compressing the heart and lungs [9].\nAir can also collect, preventing the lungs from expanding [9].\nTrauma Type Description Causes\nBlunt Trauma Skin is not broken [46] Generally caused by blunt\nforce [47]\nPenetrating\nTrauma\nObject penetrates the chest\nwall [55]\nObject pierces the chest wall\n[55]\nBoth Combination of blunt and\npenetrating forces [7]\nCan involve both blunt impact\nand penetration [7]\n2. Anatomy and Physiology of the Chest\nventilation is the body\u0027s ability to move air in and out [12].\noxygenation is delivering oxygen to the blood by diffusion [13].\nInjuries affecting ventilation and oxygenation are serious and life-threatening\n[13].\nThe thoracic cage extends from the neck to the diaphragm [14].\nPenetrating chest injuries can also injure the liver, spleen, or stomach [15].\nStriated muscle like intercostal muscles allows for ventilation [17].\nintercostal muscles extend between the ribs and allow the chest to expand\n[18].\nThe neurovascular bundle lies along the ribs and can cause significant\nbleeding [21].\nThe pleura covers the lungs and thoracic cavity [23].\nParietal pleura lines the chest wall, and visceral pleura covers the lung [24].\npleural fluid allows lungs to move freely [25].\nThe ribs connect to the vertebrae and sternum [26].\nThe trachea divides into bronchi that supply air to the lungs [27].\nThe thoracic cage contains the heart and great vessels [28].\nThe mediastinum is the central chest area with the heart, vessels,\nesophagus, and trachea [29].\nThe diaphragm separates the thoracic and abdominal cavities [30].\n3. Mechanics of Ventilation and Respiration\nintercostal muscles and the diaphragm contract during inhalation [32].\nThis decreases intrathoracic pressure, creating negative pressure [34].\nNegative pressure allows air into the lungs [34].\nMuscles relax during exhalation, allowing air out [35].\nSpinal cord injuries below C5 may affect intercostal muscles [36].\nThe diaphragm should still contract with intact phrenic nerves [37].\nSpinal injuries at C3 or above can cause complete inability to breathe [37].\ntidal volume is the air moved in a single breath, about 500 ml [38].\nminute volume is tidal volume multiplied by breaths per minute [40].\nChanging tidal or minute volume affects air movement [41].\nBag-mask devices can deliver 1000 to 1500 ml of air [42].\nOverventilation can cause gastric distension and impair lung function [43].\nOverventilation can also increase intrathoracic pressure, reducing cardiac\noutput [44].\nMeasurement Calculation Average Value\nTidal Volume Air moved in one breath ~500 ml [39]\nMinute Volume Tidal Volume x Breaths per Minute Affects air movement [41]\n4. Types of Chest Injuries: Closed vs. Open\nThere are two main types: open or closed [45].\nIn closed chest injuries, the skin is not broken [46].\nThese are usually caused by blunt trauma [47].\nBlunt trauma can cause cardiac contusion and pulmonary contusion [48].\nHeart damage can lead to cardiogenic shock [50].\nLung bruising can decrease gas exchange, causing hypoxic and hypercarbic\nstates [52].\nRib fractures can lacerate lung tissue and vessels, leading to hypovolemic\nshock [54].\nIn an open chest injury, an object penetrates the chest wall [55].\nThis causes immediate damage, but symptoms can develop over time [55].\nDo not remove an impaled object as it may be stopping bleeding [56].\nRemoving it could cause heavy bleeding and further damage [57].\nBlunt trauma can fracture ribs, sternum, chest wall, and damage the aorta [58].\nNearly one-third of car crash fatalities are due to aortic rupture [59].\nInjury Type Skin\nCondition\nCause Potential Consequences\nClosed Chest\nInjury\nNot broken\n[46]\nBlunt trauma\n[47]\nCardiac/Pulmonary contusion,\nCardiogenic/Hypovolemic shock\n[48]\nOpen Chest\nInjury\nBroken [55] Penetrating\nobject [55]\nImmediate damage, potential\nbleeding from impaled object [55]\n5. Signs and Symptoms of Chest Injuries\nSigns include pain at the injury site [60].\nPain often worsens with breathing [60].\nLook for bruising on the chest wall [60].\nCrepitus may be felt when touching the chest [60].\nAny penetrating injury is a sign [60].\nDyspnea (difficulty breathing) is common [60].\nOne or both sides of the chest may not expand normally [60].\nA rapid weak pulse and low blood pressure can indicate injury [60].\nLook for cyanosis around the lips or fingernails [60].\nDiminished breath sounds on one side may be present [60].\nLow oxygen saturation is a key sign [60].\nPatients often have tachypnea (rapid breathing) [61].\nRespirations may be shallow due to pain [61].\n6. Patient Assessment for Chest Trauma\nBegin with scene size-up, ensuring safety and precautions [62].\nDo not disturb evidence if it\u0027s a crime scene [63].\nRequest law enforcement for violent scenes [64].\nCall for utility, fire, and ALS early if needed [65].\nDetermine the mechanism of injury, common in crashes, falls, industrial\naccidents, and assaults [66].\nDetermine the number of patients and consider spinal stabilization [68].\nPerform a primary assessment, starting with a general impression [69].\nAddress life-threatening hemorrhage immediately, even before airway [70].\nNote the patient\u0027s level of consciousness [72].\nPerform a rapid physical exam [72].\nAssess airway and breathing (A and B) [73].\nEnsure a clear and patent airway [75].\nConsider early cervical spinal immobilization for blunt trauma [76].\nNote jugular vein distension, a sign of pressure on the heart [77].\nDetermine if breathing is present and adequate [78].\nInspect for DCAP-BTLS (deformities, contusions, abrasions, punctures,\nburns, tenderness, lacerations, swelling) [78].\nCheck for equal chest wall expansion [79].\nLook for paradoxical motion, indicating multiple fractured ribs [79].\nApply an occlusive dressing to all penetrating chest injuries [80].\nApply oxygen with a non-rebreather mask at 15 liters [81].\nProvide positive pressure ventilation at 100% if breathing is inadequate [81].\nBe alert for decreasing oxygen saturation [82].\nWatch for signs of impending tension pneumothorax [82].\nAssess circulation (C) [73].\nAssess pulse presence and adequacy [83].\nConsider the patient in shock if the pulse is abnormal or skin is pale, cool, or\nclammy [83].\nAddress life-threatening external bleeding immediately [83].\nMake transport decisions, prioritizing those with airway, breathing, or\ncirculation issues [84].\nPay attention to subtle clues like skin appearance, consciousness, and a\nsense of impending doom [84].\nWhen in doubt, transport the patient rapidly [84].\nTake history, investigating the chief complaint and mechanism of injury [86].\nIdentify associated signs, symptoms, and pertinent negatives [86].\nAsk about the mechanism, speed, safety equipment, weapon, and number of\nwounds [87].\nGet a SAMPLE history (Signs, Allergies, Medications, Past medical history,\nLast oral intake, Events leading up to injury) [87].\nComplete a basic evaluation if time allows [87].\nPerform a secondary assessment [88].\nFor isolated injury, focus on the affected area [89].\nEnsure wounds are identified and bleeding is controlled [90].\nLocate the extent of the injury and assess underlying systems [90].\nAssess the anterior and posterior chest wall [90].\nNote changes in the ability to maintain adequate respirations [90].\nFor significant trauma, perform a rapid physical exam using DCAP-BTLS [91].\nAssessment Step Key Actions Source\nScene Size-up Ensure safety, identify MOI, consider spinal\nstabilization\n[62]\nPrimary\nAssessment\nGeneral impression, address hemorrhage,\nassess LOC, rapid physical exam\n[69]\nAirway \u0026\nBreathing\nEnsure patent airway, spinal immobilization\n(blunt trauma), assess breathing\n[74]\nInterventions\n(A\u0026B)\nApply occlusive dressing, oxygen, positive\npressure ventilation\n[80]\nCirculation Assess pulse, look for shock, control external\nbleeding\n[83]\nTransport\nDecision\nPrioritize rapid transport for ABC problems\n[84]\nHistory Taking Investigate chief complaint, MOI, get SAMPLE\nhistory\n[86]\nSecondary\nAssessment\nPhysical exam focusing on isolated or\nsignificant trauma, DCAP-BTLS\n[88]\n7. Vital Signs and Reassessment\nAssess pulse, respiration, blood pressure, skin condition, oxygen\nsaturation, and pupils [92].\nRe-evaluate the patient every five minutes or less [93].\nA rapid pulse or respiratory rate can indicate hypoxia or blood loss [93].\nIncreased work of breathing is shown by the use of accessory muscles [94].\nPulse and respiratory rates may decrease in later stages [94].\nReassess by repeating the primary assessment [95].\nReassess the chief complaint [95].\nRe-evaluate airway, breathing, pulse, perfusion, and bleeding [95].\n8. Management and Interventions for Chest Injuries\nReassess vital signs and observe trends [96].\nProvide appropriate spinal immobilization for blunt trauma with suspected\nspinal injuries [96].\nMaintain an open airway [96].\nControl significant visible bleeding [96].\nPlace a vented chest seal or semi-vented dressing over penetrating trauma\n[96].\nProvide aggressive treatment for shock [96].\nTransport rapidly [96].\nDo not delay transport for non-life-saving treatments [97].\nThese treatments can be performed en route [97].\nCommunicate all relevant information to the receiving facility staff [97].\nKey Intervention Purpose Source\nSpinal Mobilization Protect potential spinal injuries in blunt\ntrauma\n[96]\nMaintain Open Airway Ensure clear passage for air\n[96]\nControl Visible Bleeding Stop external blood loss\n[96]\nVented Chest\nSeal/Dressing\nSeal penetrating wounds, allow air to\nescape\n[96]\nAggressive Shock\nTreatment\nAddress inadequate perfusion\n[96]\nRapid Transport Get patient to higher level of care\nquickly\n[96]\n9. Specific Chest Injuries: Pneumothorax\nPneumothorax is the accumulation of air in the pleural space [98].\nAir enters through a hole in the chest wall or lung surface [99].\nBreathing attempts cause the lung on that side to collapse [100].\nBlood passing through the collapsed lung is not oxygenated [101].\nDiminished breath sounds may occur if the lung collapses significantly [102].\nAbsent breath sounds may indicate a tension pneumothorax [103].\nA sucking sound on inhalation and rushing air on exhalation indicate a\npenetrated chest [103].\nAn open chest wound is called an open pneumothorax or sucking chest\nwound [105].\nThese wounds must be sealed with an occlusive dressing after airway\nmanagement and oxygen [106].\nA flutter valve is a one-way valve letting air out but not in [107].\nFollow local protocols for flutter valves [108].\nAn occlusive dressing can be taped on three sides to allow air to leak from\none side [109].\nMonitor for signs of tension pneumothorax after applying the dressing [110].\nIf tension pneumothorax develops, open one side of the occlusive dressing\n[111].\nA simple pneumothorax does not significantly change cardiac physiology\n[114].\nIt\u0027s often caused by blunt chest trauma resulting in fractured ribs [114].\nSigns include pleuritic pain, dyspnea, tachypnea, accessory muscle use,\ndecreased oxygen saturation, and subcutaneous emphysema [115].\nLate findings can be decreased breath sounds, lethargy, and cyanosis [116].\nPre-hospital treatment involves high flow O2 and monitoring [117].\ntension pneumothorax is ongoing air accumulation in the pleural space [118].\nIncreased pressure causes complete collapse of the uninfected lung [119].\nThe mediastinum is pushed into the opposite cavity [120].\nIt\u0027s more commonly caused by blunt trauma where a fractured rib lacerates\nthe lung [120].\nCommon signs include chest pain, tachycardia, marked respiratory distress,\nlow oxygen saturation, and absent or decreased lung sounds on the affected\nside [121].\nSigns of shock, JVD, cyanosis, or tracheal deviation may also be present but\nnot always [121].\nPre-hospital treatment includes ventilatory support with high flow oxygen [122]\n.\nRequest advanced life support and transport immediately [122].\nNeedle decompression may be performed by ALS or ED staff [123].\nType of\nPneumothorax\nCause Signs/Symptoms Management\nSimple\nPneumothorax\nBlunt trauma,\nfractured ribs\n[114]\nPleuritic pain, dyspnea,\ntachypnea, accessory\nmuscle use, decreased\nO2 sat, subcutaneous\nemphysema [115]\nHigh flow O2,\nmonitor readings\nand breath\nsounds [117]\nOpen\nPneumothorax\nPenetrating\nchest wound\n[105]\nSucking sound on\ninhalation, rushing air on\nexhalation [103]\nSeal with\nocclusive\ndressing (vented\nor taped on 3\nsides), monitor\n[106]\nTension\nPneumothorax\nOngoing air\naccumulation,\nlung laceration\n[118]\nChest pain, tachycardia,\nrespiratory distress, low\nO2 sat,\nabsent/decreased lung\nVentilatory\nsupport with high\nflow O2, request\nALS, immediate\ntransport [122]\nsounds, JVD, cyanosis\n(late) [121]\n10. Specific Chest Injuries: Hemothorax and Hemopneumothorax\nhemothorax is the collection of blood in the pleural space [124].\nThis blood comes from bleeding around the rib cage, lung, or great vessel [125]\n.\nWhen both blood and air are present, it\u0027s called a hemopneumothorax [127].\nSuspect a hemothorax if the patient shows signs of shock without obvious\nexternal bleeding [128].\nDecreased breath sounds on the affected side are also a sign [128].\nBleeding cannot be controlled in the pre-hospital setting [129].\nProvide rapid transport to a facility capable of performing surgery [129].\n11. Specific Chest Injuries: Cardiac Tamponade\ncardiac tamponade occurs when the pericardial sac fills with blood or fluid\n[131].\nThis prevents the heart from pumping enough blood [132].\nFluid buildup compresses the heart\u0027s chambers [132].\nThis dramatically impairs the heart\u0027s ability to pump blood [132].\nSigns and symptoms are known as beck\u0027s triad [133].\nComponent Description Source\nDistended Jugular\nVeins\nEngorged veins on both sides of the trachea\n[133]\n[133]\nNarrowing Pulse\nPressure\nDecreasing difference between systolic and\ndiastolic BP [133]\n[133]\nMuffled Heart Tones Heart sounds are difficult to hear [133]\n[133]\nPre-hospital care includes supporting ventilations [134].\nRapidly transporting the patient to a facility capable of intervention is crucial\n[134].\n12. Specific Chest Injuries: Rib Fractures and Flail Chest\nRib fractures are common, especially in older patients [135].\nFractures of the upper four ribs suggest a substantial mechanism of injury\n[136].\nA fractured rib can lacerate the lung surface [137].\nThis can cause pneumothorax, tension pneumothorax, hemothorax, or\nhemopneumothorax [137].\nPatients report localized tenderness and pain when breathing [138].\nPre-hospital treatment includes supplemental oxygen [139].\nA flail chest is caused by two or more adjacent fractures in two or more\nplaces [140].\nThis detaches a segment of the chest wall [140].\nThe detached segment moves opposite to normal breathing, called\nparadoxical motion [141].\nparadoxical motion is a late sign [142].\nPre-hospital treatment includes maintaining the airway [143].\nProvide respiratory support if needed [144].\nGive supplemental oxygen [144].\nPerform ongoing assessments for pneumothorax or respiratory complications\n[144].\nTreatment may include positive pressure ventilation with a bag valve mask\n[145].\nRestricting chest wall movement with a bulky dressing is no longer\nrecommended [146].\nflail chest may indicate serious internal damage and possible spinal injury [147].\n13. Other Chest Injuries\npulmonary contusion should be suspected with a flail chest [148].\nAlveoli fill with blood, and fluid accumulates, causing hypoxia [148].\nTreatment includes supplemental oxygen and positive pressure ventilations\n[149].\nSternal fractures require significant force and may involve lungs, vessels, and\nheart [150].\nClavicle fractures can damage the neurovascular bundle [152].\nSuspect upper rib fractures with medial clavicle fractures [152].\nBe alert for signs of a developing hemothorax [152].\ntraumatic asphyxia results from severe chest compression [153].\nIt causes increased pressure in the chest [153].\nCharacteristics include distended neck veins, cyanosis of face and neck, and\nhemorrhage into the sclera [154].\nThis suggests underlying heart injury and possible pulmonary contusions [155].\nTreatment involves ventilatory support with supplemental oxygen and\nmonitoring during transport [156].\ncommotio cordis is a blunt injury from a sudden blow to the chest [157].\nIt occurs during a critical part of the heartbeat [157].\nThis results in immediate cardiac arrest, often ventricular fibrillation [157].\nIt is often responsive to defibrillation and early CPR [158].\nMore common in sports injuries, suspect it in unconscious patients after a\nchest blow [159].\nLaceration of great vessels can cause massive, rapidly fatal hemorrhage [159]\n.\nTreatment includes CPR, ventilatory support, immediate transport, and\nmonitoring for shock [160].\nInjury Type Cause Key Features/Signs Management\nPulmonary\nContusion\nFlail chest, blunt\ntrauma [148]\nAlveoli filled with\nblood, fluid\naccumulation, hypoxia\n[148]\nSupplemental O2,\npositive pressure\nventilations [149]\nSternal\nFractures\nSignificant force\n[150]\nMay involve lungs,\ngreat vessels, heart\n[151]\nAssess for\nunderlying injuries\n[151]\nClavicle\nFractures\nSignificant force\n[152]\nPossible damage to\nneurovascular bundle,\nsuspect upper rib\nfractures, hemothorax\n[152]\nAssess for\nassociated injuries\n[152]\nTraumatic\nAsphyxia\nSevere chest\ncompression [153]\nDistended neck veins,\nface/neck cyanosis,\nscleral hemorrhage\n[154]\nVentilatory\nsupport,\nsupplemental O2,\nimmediate\ntransport [156]\nCommotio\nCordis\nSudden blow to\nchest during critical\nheartbeat [157]\nImmediate cardiac\narrest (VF) [157]\nEarly CPR,\ndefibrillation,\nsuspect in\nunconscious after\nchest blow [158]\nGreat Vessel\nLaceration\nPenetrating/blunt\ntrauma [159]\nMassive, rapidly fatal\nhemorrhage [159]\nCPR, ventilatory\nsupport,\nimmediate\ntransport, monitor\nfor shock [160]\n14. Review and Conclusion\nAortic shearing kills almost one-third of patients in rapid deceleration car\ncrashes [163].\nThe aorta is the body\u0027s largest artery [165].\nShearing from its structures causes rapid bleeding out [166].\nSigns of chest injury do not typically include hemoemesis (vomiting blood)\n[167].\nFor an open wound to the chest from a stabbing, the immediate action is to\ncover the wound with an occlusive dressing [167].\nWhen caring for a patient with signs of pneumothorax, the most immediate\nconcern is ventilatory inadequacy [168].\nA one-way flutter valve allows air trapped in the pleural space to be released\n[169].\nSigns of cardiac tamponade include distended jugular veins, narrowing\npulse pressure, and muffled heart tones (beck\u0027s triad) [133].\nCollapsed jugular veins are not a sign of cardiac tamponade [170].\ntraumatic asphyxia, characterized by scleral hemorrhage, is also\naccompanied by cyanosis to the face and neck [171].\nImmediate cardiac arrest in a baseball player hit in the chest is likely\ncommotio cordis [172].\nParadoxical chest movement is typically seen in patients with a flail chest\n[174].\nA patient with a large bruise over the sternum and irregular pulse after hitting\na steering wheel is likely to have injured their myocardium (bruised heart\nmuscle) [175].",

Introduction to Abdominal and Genitourinary Injuries\nThis report focuses on abdominal and genitourinary injuries. [2]\nIt covers how to manage patients with these traumas. [4]\nRecognizing life threats and the need for immediate intervention is crucial. [5]\nThe content includes detailed anatomy, physiology, and pathophysiology. [6]\nAssessment follows the primary and secondary model. [7]\nSpecific injuries discussed include blunt versus penetrating mechanisms. [8]\nIt also covers eviscerations, impaled objects, and injuries to external genitalia. [8]\n2. Anatomy and Physiology of the Abdomen\nOrgan Type Organs Characteristics Source\nHollow\nOrgans\nStomach,\nintestines, ureter,\nbladder\nContents spill into the peritoneal cavity\nwhen ruptured, causing inflammation\nand infection (peritonitis).\n[20]\nSolid\nOrgans\nLiver, spleen,\npancreas,\nkidneys\nPerform chemical work (enzyme\nproduction, blood cleansing). Rich\nblood supply leads to severe\nhemorrhage.\n[27]\nThe abdomen extends from the diaphragm to the pelvis. [11]\nIt contains organs for digestion, urinary, and genitourinary systems. [11]\nThe abdomen is divided into four quadrants. [16]\nQuadrant location of pain can indicate involved organs. [17]\nThe right lower quadrant is common for swelling and inflammation due to the\nappendix. [19]\nThe mesenteryconnects the small intestines to the abdominal wall. [22]\nmesenteryinjuries can cause significant bleeding into the peritoneal cavity. [23]\nSigns of this include abdominal rigidity and periumbilical bruising. [24]\nThe retroperitoneal space is the posterior abdomen, behind the peritoneum. [30]\nIt includes the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and most of the pancreas. [31]\n3. Mechanisms and Types of Abdominal Injuries\nTrauma\nType\nCharacteristics Common Causes Source\nBlunt\nTrauma\nNo open wound, can appear\ninitially as abrasions,\ncontusion/hematoma may take\nhours to be visible.\nMotor vehicle crashes,\nfalls, blast injuries,\nrapid deceleration,\ncompression.\n[35]\nPenetrating\nTrauma\nForeign object enters the\nabdomen, opening the peritoneal\ncavity. Open wounds can be\ndeceiving.\nKnives, handguns,\nshotguns, rifles.\n[41]\nSpecific trauma to the abdomen can be from blunt trauma, penetrating trauma, or\nboth. [12]\nInjuries to the abdomen can be either open or closed. [34]\nClosed abdominal injuries are from blunt trauma. [35]\nSeatbelts and airbags can cause injuries if not worn properly. [37]\nAn open abdominal injury involves a foreign object entering the abdomen. [41]\nMaintain a high index of suspicion for unseen injuries with open wounds. [42]\nVelocity of an object helps predict tissue damage. [44]\nLow velocity injuries are from handheld objects like knives. [45]\nMedium velocity injuries are from small caliber handguns. [46]\nHigh velocity injuries are from larger weapons like rifles. [47]\nHigh and medium velocity injuries have temporary wound channels and cavitation.\n[48]\nCavitation is pressure transferred to tissues away from the projectile. [49]\nLow velocity penetrations can still damage underlying organs. [51]\nAssume thoracic and peritoneal cavities are violated if injury is at or below the\nxyphoid process. [52]\n4. Specific Abdominal Organ Injuries\nOrgan/Area Injury Type Signs/Symptoms/Complications Source\nEvisceration Bowel protrudes\nfrom peritoneum.\nExtremely painful, visually\nshocking.\n[53]\nHollow Organs Rupture/laceration. Delayed signs/symptoms,\ncontents spill, infection\n(peritonitis).\n[57]\nSolid Organs Fracture,\nlaceration,\npuncture.\nSignificant bleeding, rapid blood\nloss or slow oozing.\n[63]\nLiver Fracture,\npenetrating\ntrauma.\nHypoperfusion, referred pain to\nthe right shoulder.\n[64]\nSpleen/Pancreas Fractured,\nlacerated,\npunctured.\nHeavy bleeding, referred left\nshoulder pain (spleen).\n[66]\nDiaphragm Penetrated or\nruptured.\nLoops of bowel may herniate into\nthoracic cavity, dyspnea,\ncompressed lungs.\n[67]\nKidneys Impacted or\npenetrated.\nSignificant blood loss, blood in\nurine (hematuria).\n[70]\nAn evisceration is when bowel protrudes from the peritoneum. [53]\nIt is extremely painful and visually shocking. [54]\nDo not push on the patient\u0027s abdomen. [55]\nHollow organ injuries often have delayed signs and symptoms. [57]\nContents spill into the abdomen, and infection develops over hours or days. [57]\nBoth blunt and penetrating trauma can cause hollow organ injuries. [57]\nBlunt trauma can cause the organ to pop. [57]\nPenetrating trauma causes direct injury like lacerations. [57]\nGallbladder and urinary bladder contents are irritating if ruptured. [58]\nFree air in the peritoneal cavityindicates a perforated hollow organ. [59]\nSevere infections and septic shock can develop if not repaired rapidly. [61]\nSolid organ injuries can cause significant and rapid blood loss. [63]\nSolid organs can also ooze blood slowly. [63]\nThe liver is large and very vascular. [64]\nIt can be injured by fractured lower ribs or penetrating trauma. [64]\nReferred pain to the right shoulder is a common finding with liver injury. [65]\nThe spleen and pancreas are also vascular and prone to heavy bleeding. [66]\nReferred left shoulder pain occurs with splenic injury. [66]\nIf the diaphragm is penetrated, bowel may herniate into the thoracic cavity. [67]\nThis can cause dyspnea and compress the lungs. [68]\nKidneys can be impacted or penetrated by trauma. [70]\nThis can cause significant blood loss. [71]\nBlood in the urine ( hematuria) is a common finding. [72]\nBlood visible on inspection of the urinary meatusindicates significant genitourinary\ntrauma. [72]\n5. Patient Assessment for Abdominal Injuries\nAssessing patients with potential abdominal injuries is challenging. [75]\nSome injuries are obvious, others easily overlooked. [75]\nSome abdominal injuries develop or worsen over time. [76]\nStart with the scene size-up. [76]\nEnsure the scene is safe. [77]\nCall for additional resources early if needed. [77]\nConsider the MOI and NOI. [77]\nConsider early spinal precautions. [77]\nPerform the primary assessment quickly. [79]\nNote the patient\u0027s level of consciousness. [80]\nAddress severe external hemorrhage first. [81]\nEnsure a clear and patent airway. [82]\nAggressively treat signs of shock. [83]\nTransport to the highest level trauma center if available. [84]\nObtain a history, including SAMPLE and OPQRST. [85]\nAsk about nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. [88]\nAsk about the appearance of bowel movements and urinary output. [89]\nAsk about referred pain. [91]\nperitonitiscan cause rebound tenderness(pain provoked by removing pressure). [92]\nguardingoccurs when the patient tenses abdominal muscles. [92]\nThe secondary assessment may not always be possible in the field. [94]\nRemove loosened clothes to expose injured regions. [95]\nTransport in a position of comfort unless spinal injury is suspected. [95]\nExamine the entire abdomen. [96]\nUse D-CAP BTLS to identify injury signs. [96]\nPalpate the abdomen, starting farthest from the painful quadrant. [97]\nPerform a full body scan for other injuries. [98]\nInspect and palpate the kidney area. [99]\nObtain and record vital signs early. [99]\nRepeat vital signs every five minutes with suspected serious injury. [99]\nhypotensionis a late sign of shock. [100]\nFor isolated abdominal injuries, visually inspect for penetrating wounds. [103]\nCheck for entrance and exit wounds. [104]\nDo not remove an impaled object. [105]\nIn reassessment, repeat the primary assessment and vital signs. [106]\nReassess interventions and treatment. [107]\nDocument the MOI, injuries, and vital signs. [107]\n6. Emergency Medical Care for Abdominal Injuries\nInjury Type Emergency Care Source\nClosed\nAbdominal\nMonitor closely for shock progression, suction available\nfor nausea/vomiting, administer oxygen, keep patient\nwarm, assist ventilations, consider ALS.\n[109]\nOpen\nAbdominal\nFollow general procedures for blunt injury care, inspect\nback/sides for exit wound, apply dry sterile dressing,\nstabilize impaled objects.\n[111]\nAbdominal\nEvisceration\nPlace a sterile dressing moist with saline over the\nwound, apply a bandage, transport, never replace\nprotruding organs, keep affected area warm.\n[113]\nFor closed abdominal injuries, monitor for shock. [109]\nHave suction available for nausea and vomiting. [110]\nAdminister oxygen to unconscious or shocked patients. [110]\nKeep the patient warm. [110]\nAssist ventilations if needed. [110]\nConsider ALS for NG tube placement. [110]\nOpen abdominal injuries generally have obvious wounds. [111]\nSignificant external bleeding is not always present. [112]\nMaintain a high suspicion for unseen blood loss. [112]\nFollow general procedures for blunt abdominal injury care. [112]\nInspect the patient\u0027s back and sides for an exit wound. [112]\nApply a dry sterile dressing to all open wounds. [112]\nIf a penetrating object is in place, apply a stabilizing bandage. [112]\nThis controls bleeding and minimizes object movement. [112]\nSevere lacerations can result in an evisceration. [112]\neviscerationis fat or internal organs protruding from the wound. [113]\nPlace a sterile dressing moistened with saline over the wound. [114]\nApply a bandage and transport. [114]\nNever try to replace the protruding injury. [115]\nKeep the affected area warm. [115]\n7. Anatomy and Physiology of the Genitourinary System\nThe genitourinary system controls reproductive functions and waste discharge.\n[117]\nOrgans of this system are in the abdomen. [118]\nKidneys are the solid organs. [118]\nThe ureters, bladder, and urethraare hollow organs. [118]\nMale genitalia are outside the pelvic cavity, except for the prostate and seminal\nvesicles. [119]\nFemale genitalia are entirely within the pelvis, except the vulva, clitoris, and labia.\n[119]\n8. Injuries to the Genitourinary System\nOrgan/Area Cause of Injury Consequences/Findings Source\nKidneys Force blow,\npenetrating injury,\nindirect blow (e.g.,\nfootball tackle).\nSignificant injuries, abrasion,\nlaceration, contusion in flank\narea, hematoma.\n[122]\nUrinary\nBladder\nBlunt injury to lower\nabdomen/pelvis\n(especially when full),\npenetrating wounds.\nRupture, urine spills into tissues,\nshearing from urethra (males),\nincreased injury risk in\npregnancy.\n[125]\nExternal\nGenitalia\n(Male)\nSoft tissue wounds,\nsudden deceleration,\ndirect blows, straddle\ninjuries, pelvic\nfractures, penetrating\nwounds.\nPainful, rarely life-threatening\n(unless significant bleeding),\navulsions, amputations, urethral\nlacerations, scrotal damage.\n[132]\nExternal\nGenitalia\n(Female)\nTrauma. Painful (rich nerve supply),\nconsider sexual assault and\npregnancy.\n[138]\nInternal\nGenitalia\n(Female)\nRarely damaged (small,\ndeep, protected).\nUterus enlarges and is\nvulnerable during pregnancy,\nrich blood supply during\npregnancy makes injuries\nserious.\n[134]\nKidney injuries are not common and rarely occur in isolation. [122]\nSignificant injuries can result from an indirect blow. [122]\nSuspect kidney damage with flank abrasion, laceration, or contusion. [123]\nPenetrating wounds in the lower rib cage, hip, or upper abdomen area suggest\nkidney injury. [124]\nFractures of the lower rib cage or lumbar vertebrae can also indicate kidney\ndamage. [124]\nA hematoma in the flank region is evidence of potential kidney damage. [124]\nUrinary bladder injuries may result in rupture, spilling urine into tissues. [125]\nBlunt injuries to the lower abdomen or pelvis can cause rupture, especially if the\nbladder is full. [127]\nPenetrating wounds of the lower mid-abdomen or perineumcan directly injure the\nbladder. [127]\nIn males, sudden deceleration can shear the bladder from the urethra. [128]\nBladder injuries increase in later pregnancy due to ureter displacement. [129]\nFracture of the pelvis can result in bladder perforation. [130]\nExternal genitalia injuries are painful but rarely life-threatening unless bleeding is\nsignificant. [132]\nPain may be referred to the lower abdomen. [133]\nInternal female genitalia are rarely damaged due to their protected location. [134]\nExceptions occur during pregnancy when the uterus enlarges and is more\nvulnerable. [136]\nUterine injuries during pregnancy can be serious due to rich blood supply. [137]\nExternal female genitalia injuries are painful due to rich nerve supply. [139]\nConsider sexual assault and pregnancy with female external genitalia injuries. [139]\n9. Patient Assessment for Genitourinary Injuries\nPotential for patient embarrassment exists with genitourinary injuries. [144]\nMaintain a professional presence and provide privacy. [144]\nHave an EMT of the same gender perform the assessment if possible. [144]\nAssess for scene hazards and threats during the scene size-up. [145]\nApply standard precautions. [146]\nLook for indicators of the mechanism of injury. [146]\nPatients may avoid discussion to avoid physical exam. [147]\nPatients may provide a less embarrassing MOI. [148]\nIn the primary assessment, quickly scan the patient. [149]\nInjuries can produce a significant amount of blood volume. [149]\nDo not avoid this area if bleeding is present. [149]\nMaintain privacy. [150]\nControl severe bleeding first. [151]\nEnsure a clear and patent airway. [152]\nProvide assessment ventilations as needed. [152]\nConsider the need for spinal motion restriction. [152]\nFor circulation, assess pulse rate, skin condition, color, temperature, and cap refill.\n[153]\nClosed injuries do not have visible bleeding signs. [154]\nTreat for signs of shock. [154]\nNote the patient\u0027s level of alertness. [154]\nTransport to a trauma center. [155]\nFor history taking, investigate the chief complaint. [157]\nCommon complaints include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and blood in the urine. [158]\nUse OPQRST and ask about output, especially blood in the urine. [160]\nAsk about allergies and previous injuries. [160]\nLast food intake and fluids are important. [162]\nAddress events leading up to the injury. [162]\nA secondary assessment may not always be possible. [163]\nIf the patient has an isolated injury, focus on that region. [164]\nAssess for D-CAP BTLS. [164]\nObtain vital signs and reassess frequently. [164]\nIn reassessment, repeat the primary assessment and vital signs. [165]\nReassess interventions and treatment. [165]\nAdjust interventions as necessary. [165]\nCommunicate concerns to hospital staff. [165]\nDescribe all injuries and treatments given. [166]\n10. Emergency Medical Care for Genitourinary Injuries\nInjury Type Emergency Care Source\nKidney Injury Treat for shock, transport promptly, monitor vital signs.\n[167]\nUrinary\nBladder Injury\nSuspect with blood in urethra or trauma to lower\nabdomen/pelvis/perineum, transport promptly if\nshock/associated injuries present, monitor vital signs.\n[169]\nExternal Male\nGenitalia\nInjury\nUse sterile moist compresses for stripped skin, apply\ndirect pressure with dry sterile gauze for bleeding, never\nmanipulate foreign objects, identify and transport avulsed\nparts, wrap penile avulsion in moist sterile dressing.\n[171]\nPenile\nAmputation\nManage blood loss with local pressure, never apply\nconstricting device, preserve amputated part in cool\ncontainer.\n[175]\nRectal\nBleeding\nConsider possible causes like sexual assault, foreign\nbodies, hemorrhoids, or ulcers.\n[197]\nExternal\nFemale\nGenitalia\nInjury\nTreat lacerations, abrasions, avulsions with moist sterile\ncompresses, use local pressure, hold dressings with\ndiaper type bandage, do not place dressings in vagina,\nleave foreign objects in place.\n[193]\nFor kidney injuries, damage may not be obvious. [167]\nLook for signs of shock or blood in the urine. [167]\nTreat for shock and transport promptly. [168]\nMonitor vital signs en route. [168]\nSuspect a urinary bladder injury with blood in the urethraopening. [169]\nAlso suspect with signs of trauma to the lower abdomen, pelvis, or perineum. [169]\nTransport promptly if shock or associated injuries are present. [170]\nMonitor vital signs en route. [170]\nFor external male genitalia injuries, injuries are painful. [171]\nThey are rarely life-threatening unless bleeding is significant. [172]\nUse sterile moist compresses for areas stripped of skin. [172]\nApply direct pressure with dry sterile gauze to control bleeding. [172]\nNever move or manipulate foreign objects in the urethra. [172]\nIdentify and take avulsed parts to the hospital. [172]\nIf skin on the penis is avulsed, wrap the penis in a moist sterile dressing. [173]\nTransport promptly and use direct pressure. [173]\nTry to save and preserve the skin. [174]\nFor penile amputation, managing blood loss is top priority. [175]\nUse local pressure on the remaining stump. [176]\nNever apply a constricting device. [177]\nSurgical reconstruction is possible if the amputated part is located. [177]\nWrap the part in moist sterile dressing, place in a bag, and transport in a cool\ncontainer. [178]\nAvoid direct contact with ice. [178]\nSevere damage to connective tissue can fracture or angulate the shaft. [179]\nAccidental laceration of the penis head is associated with heavy bleeding. [182]\nLocal pressure usually stops hemorrhage. [183]\nSkin can get caught in a zipper. [183]\nCut pants if a small segment is involved; use heavy scissors for larger segments.\n[184]\nurethrainjuries in males are not very common. [186]\nLacerations can result from straddle injuries, pelvic fractures, or penetrating\nwounds. [186]\nIt is important to know if the patient can urinate or if there is blood in the urine. [187]\nSave any urination for hospital examination. [187]\nForeign bodies protruding from the urethraneed surgical removal. [188]\nA bulging scrotummay indicate damaged contents. [189]\nWrap scrotal contents or the perineal wall with a moist compress. [190]\nUse local pressure to control bleeding. [191]\nDirect blows to the scrotumcan rupture a testicle and cause blood accumulation.\n[192]\nApply an ice pack to the scrotal area during transport. [192]\nFor female genitalia injuries, treat lacerations, abrasions, or avulsions with moist\nsterile compresses. [193]\nUse local pressure to control bleeding. [193]\nHold dressings in place with a diaper type bandage. [193]\nDo not place any dressings into the vagina. [194]\nLeave any foreign objects in place after stabilizing with bandages. [195]\nInjuries are painful but generally not life-threatening. [195]\nHospital evaluation is required. [196]\nTransport urgency depends on associated injuries, hemorrhage amount, and shock\npresence. [196]\n11. Rectal Bleeding and Sexual Assault\nRectal bleeding is a common complaint. [197]\nPossible causes include sexual assault, foreign bodies, hemorrhoids, or ulcers. [198]\nSignificant bleeding can occur after hemorrhoid surgery. [199]\nSexual assault is a serious issue. [200]\nVictims are generally women, but can be men and children. [200]\nOften, compassion and transport are the main roles. [201]\nThe patient may have multi-system trauma and need shock treatment. [202]\nDo not examine unless obvious bleeding requires a dressing. [203]\nFollow appropriate protocols and procedures. [204]\nShield the patient from onlookers. [204]\nDocument history, assessment, treatment, and response for court appearances.\n[204]\nFollow crime scene policy. [205]\nAdvise the patient not to wash, bathe, shower, douche, urinate, or defecate until\nafter the exam. [207]\nIf oral penetration occurred, advise the patient not to eat, drink, brush teeth, or use\nmouthwash until after the exam. [208]\nHandle the patient\u0027s clothes as little as possible. [209]\nPlace clothing and evidence in paper bags. [209]\nDo not use plastic bags as mold can destroy evidence. [210]\nHave an EMT of the same gender care for the patient whenever possible. [211]\nTreat medical injuries. [212]\nProvide privacy, support, and reassurance. [212]\n12. Review and Conclusion\nThis chapter reviewed abdominal and genitourinary injuries. [213]\nperitonitismost likely results from hollow organ injuries. [216]\nSolid organs like the liver are most likely to bleed profusely if severely injured. [219]\nIntra-abdominal bleeding is common after blunt trauma. [220]\nThe absence of pain does not rule out intra-abdominal bleeding. [220]\nProperly worn seat belts can still cause injury, possibly to the iliac crest. [220]\nA deformed steering wheel suggests the driver experienced an abdominal injury.\n[222]\nAlternative management for abdominal eviscerationincludes applying an occlusive\ndressing. [223]\nA patient with possible peritonitismay prefer to sit with legs drawn up. [224]\nPain in the left flank after a football tackle is most concerning for kidney injury. [225]\nhematuriais defined as blood in the urine. [228]\nLocal pressure can usually control bleeding for female external genitalia trauma.\n[230]\nThis report summarizes key aspects of abdominal and genitourinary injuries.",

Introduction to Orthopedic Injuries and the Musculoskeletal\nSystem\northopedic injuries are a common reason for seeking medical attention [7].\nThese injuries often cause pain, swelling, and deformity [8].\nWhile rarely fatal, musculoskeletal injuries can result in short or long-term\ndisability [9].\nThe musculoskeletal system provides form, upright posture, and movement [5]\n.\nIt also protects vital internal organs [6].\nThe body has three types of muscles: skeletal, smooth, and cardiac [12].\nSkeletal muscles are also called striated muscle due to their stripes [13].\nThey attach to bones and usually cross at least one joint [13].\nThey are voluntary muscles under direct control of the voluntary\nsystem [14].\nSkeletal muscles make up the largest portion of the body\u0027s muscle\nmass [16].\nThey are supplied with arteries, veins, and nerves [17].\nSkeletal muscle tissue attaches directly to bone by tendons [18].\nSmooth muscle is involuntary and performs much of the body\u0027s\nautonomic work [19].\nFound in the walls of most tubular structures, they control the\nmovement of contents within these structures by contracting and\nrelaxing [20].\nCardiac muscle is a specially adapted involuntary muscle with its own\nregulatory system [22].\nThe skeleton gives recognizable human form, protects vital internal\norgans, and allows movement [24].\nIt consists of approximately 206 bones [25].\nBones produce red blood cells in the bone marrow [26].\nThey also serve as a reservoir for important minerals and electrolytes [26].\nSystem\nComponent\nKey Function Associated Structure/Example\nSkeletal Muscle Movement, Posture, Form Attaches to bones by tendons,\nlargest muscle mass\nSmooth Muscle Autonomic work,\nMovement of contents\nWalls of tubular structures (e.g.,\nblood vessels)\nCardiac Muscle Involuntary muscle with\nregulatory system\nHeart\nSkeletal System Form, Protection,\nMovement, Blood\nProduction\nApproximately 206 bones,\nproduces red blood cells\n2. Anatomy of the Skeletal System\nThe skull is a solid, vault-like structure protecting the brain [28].\nThe thoracic cage protects the heart, lungs, and great vessels [29].\nThe lower ribs protect the liver and spleen [30].\nThe bony spinal canal encases and protects the spinal cord [30].\nThe pectoral or shoulder girdle consists of two scapula and two clavicles [30]\n.\nThe scapula (shoulder blade) is a flat, triangular bone held to the rib cage\nby powerful muscles [31].\nThe clavicle (collarbone) is a slender s-shaped bone attached to the\nsternum and acromion process by ligaments [31].\nThe clavicle is vulnerable to injury because it is slender and exposed [33].\nThe upper extremities extend from the shoulder to the fingertips [35].\nThey are composed of the upper arm (humerus), elbow, and forearm\n(radius and ulna) [35].\nThe humerus joins the shoulder girdle at the joint [36].\nThe humerus connects to the forearm bones to form a hinged elbow joint\n[36].\nThe hand contains three sets of bones: carpals (wrist bones), metacarpals\n(hand bones), and phalanges (finger bones) [37].\nThe pelvis supports body weight and protects structures like the bladder,\nrectum, and female reproductive organs [38].\nThe pelvic girdle is three fused bones (ilium, ischium, and pubis) forming\nthe hip joint [39].\nThe lower extremities consist of bones of the thigh, leg, and foot [40].\nThe femur (thigh bone) is a long, powerful bone [41].\nIt connects to the pelvis in a ball and socket joint and to the knees in a\nhinged joint [42].\nThe lower leg consists of two bones: the tibia and fibula [42].\nThe foot consists of three classes of bones: tarsals (ankle joints),\nmetatarsals (foot bones), and phalanges (toe bones) [43].\n3. Joints and Mechanisms of Injury\nA joint is formed where two bones come into contact [46].\nJoints are held together by a tough fibrous capsule [46].\nThe capsule is supported and strengthened by bands of fibrous tissues called\nligaments [47].\nIn moving joints, bone ends are covered with articular cartilage [48].\nJoints are bathed and lubricated by synovial fluid [49].\nJoints allow different motions:\nCircular motion (e.g., shoulder joint) [49].\nHinge motion (e.g., elbow and knee) [49].\nMinimal motion (e.g., sternoclavicular joints) [49].\nNo motion (e.g., sutures in the skull) [49].\nSignificant force is generally required to cause fractures and dislocations [51].\nForces can include direct blows, indirect forces, twisting forces, or high\nenergy forces [51].\nA slight force can fracture a bone weakened by a tumor, infection, or\nosteoporosis [52].\nSuspect a fracture in an older patient reporting pain after a mild injury [53].\nType of\nJoint\nExample Motion Allowed Supporting\nStructure\nBall and\nSocket\nShoulder, Hip Circular motion Capsule,\nLigaments\nHinge Elbow, Knee Hinge motion (bending and\nstraightening)\nCapsule,\nLigaments\nMinimal\nMotion\nSternoclavicular Limited movement Ligaments\nNo Motion Sutures (Skull) No movement Capsule\n4. Types of Musculoskeletal Injuries: Fractures\nA fracture is a break in the continuity of the bone [54].\nfractures often occur due to an external force [54].\nfractures are classified as either open or closed [55].\nAn open fracture has an external wound [55].\nThe wound can be caused by the initial blow or by the broken bone\nlacerating the skin [55].\nTreat any injury that breaks the skin as a possible open fracture [56].\nComplications of open fractures include increased blood loss and a higher\nlikelihood of infection [57].\nfractures are also described by whether the bone has moved from its normal\nposition [58].\nA non-displaced fracture, or hairline fracture, is a simple crack [59].\nIt can be difficult to distinguish from a sprain or contusion [59].\nA displaced fracture produces deformity by shortening, rotating, or\nangulating the limb [60].\nSpecific types of fractures include:\nGreenstick fracture: Incomplete fracture passing partly through the bone\nshaft [61].\nOblique fracture: Bone broken at an angle across the bone [61].\nPathologic fracture: Fracture of a weakened or diseased bone by minimal\nforce [61].\nIncomplete fracture: Does not run completely through the bone [61].\nComminuted fracture: Bone broken into more than two fragments [62].\nEpiphyseal fracture: Occurs in the growth section of a child\u0027s bone,\npotentially leading to growth abnormalities [63].\nSpiral fracture: Caused by twisting force, creating an oblique fracture\naround and through the bone [66].\nTransverse fracture: Occurs straight across the bone [66].\nSuspect a fracture if these signs and symptoms are present [67]:\nDeformity or tenderness [68].\nGuarding or swelling [68].\nBruising [68].\ncrepitus (grating sound or sensation) [68].\nfalse motion (movement where there shouldn\u0027t be) [68].\nExposed fragments [68].\nPain [68].\nA locked joint [68].\n5. Types of Musculoskeletal Injuries: Dislocations, Sprains,\nStrains, and Amputations\nA dislocation is a disruption of a joint where bone ends are no longer in\ncontact [70].\nSupporting ligaments are often torn, allowing bone ends to separate [71].\nA fracture dislocation is a combination injury with a dislocated joint and a\nfracture of bone ends [72].\nSome dislocated joints may spontaneously reduce before assessment [73].\nHistory taking can help confirm a spontaneously reduced dislocation [74].\nA dislocation that doesn\u0027t reduce is a serious problem [75].\nCommonly dislocated joints include fingers, shoulders, elbows, and knees [76].\nSigns and symptoms of a dislocated joint are similar to fractures [77]:\nMarked deformity [77].\nSwelling [77].\nPain aggravated by movement attempts [77].\nTenderness on palpation [77].\nVirtually complete loss of normal joint motion (locked joint) [77].\nNumbness or impaired circulation [77].\nA sprain occurs when a joint is twisted or stretched beyond its normal range\nof motion [78].\nSupporting capsular and ligaments are stretched or torn [78].\nsprains range from mild to severe [79].\nThe most vulnerable joints are knees, shoulders, and ankles [79].\nAfter injury, alignment generally returns to near normal [80].\nSigns and symptoms of sprains include guarding, swelling, ecchymosis, pain,\nor joint instability [81].\nA strain is basically a pulled muscle [82].\nIt involves stretching or tearing of the muscle [82].\nStrains cause pain, swelling, and bruising of soft tissues [83].\nUnlike a sprain, typically no ligament or joint damage occurs [84].\nOften, no deformity is present, and only minor swelling is noted [85].\nMost patients will have extreme point tenderness with a strain [86].\nAn amputation is an injury where an extremity is completely severed [88].\nAmputations can damage every aspect of the musculoskeletal system [89].\nInjury\nType\nDefinition Key Characteristics Associated\nSigns/Symptoms\nDislocation Disruption of a joint,\nbone ends lose\ncontact\nSupporting\nligaments often torn,\npotential for\nspontaneous\nreduction\nMarked deformity,\nswelling, pain,\ntenderness, locked\njoint\nSprain Joint\ntwisted/stretched\nbeyond normal\nrange of motion\nSupporting\nligaments\nstretched/torn,\nrange from mild to\nsevere\nGuarding, swelling,\nbruising, pain, joint\ninstability\nStrain Stretching or tearing\nof a muscle (pulled\nmuscle)\nNo ligament/joint\ndamage typical,\nminor swelling\nPain, swelling,\nbruising, extreme\npoint tenderness\nAmputation Complete severance\nof an extremity\nDamages bone,\nligament, and\nmuscle\nSevere bleeding,\nshock, absence of a\nlimb (obvious)\n6. Complications of Musculoskeletal Injuries\northopedic injuries can lead to numerous complications [91].\nComplications are not limited to the musculoskeletal system [91].\nSystematic changes or illness can occur [91].\nThe likelihood of complications is related to the force of injury, location, and\npatient\u0027s overall health [92].\nTo prevent contamination in open fractures, brush away obvious debris on the\nskin [94].\nDo not enter or probe an open fractured site before applying a dressing [96].\nPreventing further injury helps reduce the risk of long-term disability [97].\nReducing the risk of wound infection also helps reduce long-term disability\n[97].\nTransporting patients to the appropriate medical facility contributes to\nreducing long-term disability [97].\n7. Assessing the Severity of Injury and Patient Assessment\nThe \"golden period\" is critical for preserving limb viability in extremities with\nless than complete circulation [99].\nProlonged hypoperfusion can cause significant damage [100].\nAny suspected open fracture or vascular injury is considered a critical\nemergency [101].\nMost injuries are not critical [102].\nAlways look at the big picture when assessing patients [105].\nEvaluate the overall situation to determine and treat any life threats [105].\nDistinguish mild injuries from severe injuries [106].\nSome severe injuries may compromise neurovascular function, threatening\nlong-term function [106].\nScene size-up is crucial [109].\nScene safety is the number one priority [109].\nIdentify forces associated with the mechanism of injury [109].\nStandard precautions like gloves may be needed [110].\nA mask and gown may be necessary [110].\nConsider the possibility of hidden bleeding [111].\nEvaluate the need for law enforcement, advanced life support, or\nadditional ambulances [112].\nBe alert for primary and secondary injuries based on the mechanism of injury\n[113].\nThe primary assessment focuses on identifying and managing life threats\n[114].\nTreat the patient according to their level of consciousness [114].\nEx-ABCs are always a priority (Exsanguination, Airway, Breathing,\nCirculation) [114].\nCheck for responsiveness using the AVPU scale [115].\nConsider high flow oxygen for patients with less than alert and oriented\nconsciousness [115].\nMusculoskeletal injuries may be lower priority if significant trauma affects\nmultiple body systems [116].\nfractures and sprains usually don\u0027t cause airway or breathing problems\n[117].\nFocus on determining if the patient has a pulse, adequate perfusion, or is\nbleeding [118].\nTreat the patient for shock immediately if skin is pale, cool, or clammy, or\ncapillary refill is slow [119].\nMaintain a normal body temperature [120].\nStabilize extremity injuries before moving the patient [120].\nTransport decisions depend on the patient\u0027s condition and mechanism of\ninjury [121].\nProvide rapid transport for patients with airway/breathing problems or\nsignificant bleeding [121].\nPatients with a significant mechanism of injury, but otherwise stable,\nshould be transported promptly [122].\nFor rapid transport with a significant mechanism, a backboard can splint\nthe whole body [123].\nPatients with a simple mechanism can be assessed and stabilized on\nscene if no other problems exist [124].\nAssessment\nStep\nFocus Key Actions\nScene Size-Up Safety, Mechanism of\nInjury\nScene safety, identify forces,\nconsider standard precautions,\nhidden bleeding\nPrimary\nAssessment\nIdentifying/Managing Life\nThreats\nEx-ABCs priority, check\nresponsiveness, consider oxygen,\nevaluate circulation\nShock\nManagement\nTreating inadequate\nperfusion\nTreat immediately if signs\npresent, maintain temperature\nStabilization\n(Extremities)\nPreparing for transport Stabilize injuries before moving\nthe patient\nTransport\nDecision\nDetermining urgency and\nmethod of transport\nRapid transport for life\nthreats/significant MOI,\nbackboard for whole body splint\n8. History Taking and Secondary Assessment\nObtain a medical history and be alert for injury-specific signs, symptoms,\nand pertinent negatives [128].\nObtain a sample history for all trauma patients [129].\nThe detail of the history depends on the patient\u0027s condition and transport\nurgency [130].\nOPQRST can be of limited use and too lengthy in severe injury cases [131].\nRapid transport requires immediate attention to airway, breathing, or\ncirculation [133].\nThe secondary assessment involves a physical exam [135].\nIf significant trauma affects multiple systems, perform a head-to-toe\nassessment [135].\nWork systematically from head to feet, checking the head, chest, abdomen,\nextremities, and back [136].\nThe goal is to identify hidden and potentially life-threatening injuries [137].\nUse the DCAP-BTLS approach to assess the musculoskeletal system [137].\nConsider an open fracture when lacerations are present in an extremity [138].\nBleeding control and dressings must be applied [139].\nInjury or deformity of a bone may be associated with vessel or nerve injury\n[140].\nObtain a baseline neurovascular assessment [141].\nAlways recheck neurovascular function before splinting or manipulating a limb\n[141].\nExamination of an injured limb should include the Six P\u0027s of musculoskeletal\nassessment [142]:\nPain [143].\nParalysis [143].\nparesthesia (numbness or tingling) [143].\nPulselessness [143].\nPallor (not power) [143].\nPressure [143].\nDetermine a baseline set of vital signs [143].\n9. Reassessment and Documentation\nReassessment is crucial to ensure interventions are working [144].\nPerform reassessment every five minutes for unstable patients [145].\nPerform reassessment every fifteen minutes for stable patients [145].\nDuring reassessment, assess the patient\u0027s overall condition [146].\nStabilize the XABCs [146].\nControl any serious bleeding in critically injured patients [147].\nSecure critically injured patients to a long backboard for prompt transport to a\ntrauma center [148].\nIn critical situations, a secondary assessment may be a waste of valuable time\n[149].\nReassess the patient en route to the emergency department [150].\nIf the patient has no life-threatening injuries, take time on scene to stabilize\ntheir condition [150].\nApply a secure splint after assessing the extremity for non-life-threatening\ninjuries [151].\nSplinting should be done prior to transport [152].\nCommunication and documentation are vital [152].\nDocument complete descriptions of injuries and associated mechanisms of\ninjury [152].\nDocument the presence or absence of circulation, motor function, or\nsensation distal to the injured extremity [153].\nDocument neurovascular status after manipulation or splinting [153].\nDocument neurovascular status on arrival at the hospital [153].\nPatient\nStability\nReassessment\nFrequency\nKey Actions During Reassessment\nUnstable Every 5 minutes Assess overall condition, stabilize\nXABCs, control bleeding\nStable Every 15 minutes Assess overall condition, stabilize\nXABCs, control bleeding\n10. Emergency Medical Care and Splinting Principles\nEmergency care for musculoskeletal injuries involves performing a primary\nassessment [155].\nStabilize the patient\u0027s ABCs if needed [155].\nPerform a secondary assessment of the entire body or specific injured area\n[156].\nBe alert for signs and symptoms of internal bleeding [157].\nFollow specific skill drill steps when caring for these patients [157].\nA splint is a flexible or rigid device protecting and maintaining the position of\nan injured extremity [158].\nSplint fractures, dislocations, and sprains before moving the patient, unless\nlife is in immediate danger [159].\nSplinting reduces pain and makes transport easier [160].\nSplinting helps prevent [161]:\nFurther damage to muscles, spinal cord, nerves, and blood vessels from\nbroken bone ends [161].\nLaceration of skin by broken bones [162].\nRestriction of blood vessel flow from pressure of bone ends [162].\nExcessive bleeding from tissues at the injury site [162].\nIncreased pain from bone movement [162].\nParalysis of extremities [162].\nGeneral principles of splinting [163]:\nRemove clothing from the suspected fracture/dislocation area to inspect\nfor DCAP-BTLS [163].\nNote and record neurovascular status distal to the injury (pulse, sensation,\nmovement) [164].\nCover open wounds with dry, sterile dressings before splinting [165].\nDo not move the patient before splinting unless there\u0027s immediate danger\nor uncorrected life threats [166].\nFor a suspected fracture of a bone shaft, stabilize the joints above and\nbelow the fracture [167].\nFor injuries in and around a joint, stabilize the bones above and below the\ninjured joint [167].\nPad all rigid splints to prevent local pressure and discomfort [168].\nMaintain manual stabilization while applying the splint to minimize limb\nmovement [169].\nSupport the injury site [169].\nUse constant gentle manual traction to align a severely deformed long\nbone shaft fracture for splinting [170].\nIf encountering resistance or pain during alignment, splint the limb in its\ndeformed position [171].\nImmobilize suspected spinal injuries in a neutral inline position on a\nbackboard [172].\nIf the patient shows signs of shock, align the limb in the normal atomic\nposition and transport [172].\nWhen in doubt, splint [173].\n11. Types of Splints and Hazards of Improper Splinting\nRigid splints are non-formable and made of firm material [174].\nThey are applied to the sides, front, and back of an injured extremity to\nprevent motion [175].\nSplint a limb in the position of deformity if the deformity is severe or if you\nencounter resistance/pain during gentle traction of a shaft fracture [176].\nFormable splints include SAM splints and vacuum splints [177].\nSAM splint stands for structural aluminum manual splint [177].\nOther examples are air splints, pillow splints, and sling and swathe splints\n[179].\nA vacuum splint can be shaped around a deformed limb [180].\nAir is pulled out of a vacuum splint using a hand pump [181].\nPelvic binders are used to splint the bony pelvis [183].\nThey reduce hemorrhage from bone ends and venous disruption [184].\nPelvic binders also help reduce pain [184].\nHazards of improper splinting [186]:\nCompression can injure nerves, tissues, and blood vessels [186].\nImproper splinting can delay transport for patients with life-threatening\ninjuries [187].\nIt can reduce distal circulation [187].\nImproper splinting can aggravate the injury [187].\nExcessive movement of the bone or joint can injure tissues, nerves, blood\nvessels, or muscles [187].\nSplint Type Characteristics Common Use\nCases\nPotential Hazards of\nImproper Use\nRigid Splint Non-formable, firm\nmaterial, prevents\nmotion\nApplied to\nsides/front/back of\nextremity\nCompression,\nnerve/tissue/vessel\ninjury\nFormable\nSplint\nFlexible, can be\nmolded (SAM,\nvacuum, air, pillow)\nAround deformed\nlimbs, various\nextremity injuries\nReduced circulation,\naggravated injury\nPelvic\nBinder\nSecures bony pelvis Pelvic fractures Delayed transport,\nfurther injury\n12. Transportation Considerations\nVery few musculoskeletal injuries justify excessive speed during transport\n[189].\nA patient with a pulseless limb must be given high priority [190].\nIf the treatment facility is an hour or more away, transport a patient with a\npulseless limb by helicopter or immediate ground transport [190].\n13. Specific Musculoskeletal Injuries: Upper Extremities\nclavicle (collar bone) fractures are among the most common bone fractures\n[191].\nCommon in children falling with an outstretched hand [192].\nPatients report pain in the shoulder and hold the arm across the body [192].\nSwelling and point tenderness occur over the clavicle [193].\nclavicle fractures may lead to neurovascular compromise due to nearby\nvessels and nerves [194].\nscapula (shoulder blade) fractures are less frequent due to muscle\nprotection [195].\nAlmost always result from forceful direct blows to the back over the\nscapula [195].\nAssociated chest injuries pose the greatest threat, not the fracture itself\n[196].\nAbrasions, contusions, and significant pain occur [198].\nPatients limit arm use due to pain [198].\nAcromioclavicular (AC) joint separation occurs at the joint below the\nclavicle and scapula\u0027s acromion process [199].\nFrequently separated during sports when falling on the point of the\nshoulder [200].\nclavicle and scapula fractures can be splinted with a sling and swath [201].\nShoulder dislocations most commonly occur anteriorly [203].\nResult from forceful adduction and external rotation [203].\nShoulder dislocations are extremely painful [204].\nPatients may report hand numbness due to nervous or circulatory\ncompromise [204].\nStabilizing an anterior shoulder dislocation is difficult as moving the arm\ntowards the chest wall causes pain [205].\nSplint the joint in the position most comfortable for the patient [205].\nSling the forearm and wrist to support the arm\u0027s weight [206].\nSecure the arm in a sling to a pillow and chest with a swath [206].\nTransport the patient seated or semi-seated [207].\nhumerus fractures occur proximally, mid-shaft, or distally at the elbow [209].\nConsider applying traction to realign severely angulated fractures before\nsplinting [210].\nSupport the fracture site and gently pull the humeral condyles in line with\nthe limb\u0027s normal axis [211].\nSplint the arm with a sling and swath and a padded board splint on the\nlateral aspect [213].\nElbow injuries (fractures and dislocations) are often difficult to distinguish\nwithout X-rays [214].\nThey produce similar deformities and require the same emergency care\n[215].\nDistal humerus fractures (supracondylar/intracondylar) are common in\nchildren [216].\nFracture fragments often rotate, injuring vessels and nerves [217].\nSwelling occurs rapidly and is severe [218].\nElbow dislocations occur in athletes and rarely young children [219].\nThe ulna and radius are often displaced posteriorly relative to the\nhumerus [219].\nThere is swelling and potential for vessel/nerve injuries [220].\nFracture of the olecranon process of the ulna results from direct or\nindirect forces [221].\nOften associated with lacerations and abrasions [221].\nPatients cannot actively extend the elbow [221].\nfractures of the radial head are often missed [222].\nGenerally occur from a fall on an outstretched arm or direct blow to the\nlateral elbow [222].\nAttempting to rotate the elbow or wrist causes discomfort [223].\nCare for elbow injuries requires careful management [224].\nAssess distal neurovascular function periodically [225].\nIf pulses and cap refill are good, splint the elbow in the position found,\nadding a wrist sling if helpful [226].\nA cold, pale hand, weak/absent pulse, or poor cap refill indicates likely\nblood vessel injury [227].\nIf the limb is pulseless and severely deformed at the elbow, apply\ngentle manual traction to decrease deformity and provide prompt\ntransport [229].\nForearm fractures are seen most often in children and older people [230].\nUsually, both radius and ulna break from a fall on an outstretched hand\n[230].\nIsolated ulna shaft fractures can occur from a direct blow (nightstick\nfracture) [232].\nDistal radius fractures (Colles\u0027 fracture) are common in elderly patients\nwith osteoporosis [233].\nStabilize forearm and wrist fractures with padded board, air vacuum, or\npillow splints [234].\nWrist and hand injuries often involve dislocations associated with fractures\n(fracture dislocation) [236].\nAn isolated, non-displaced carpal bone fracture (scaphoid) is also\ncommon [237].\nImproper treatment can lead to permanent disability and deformity due to\nintricate function [238].\nFollow skill drill steps to splint the hand and wrist [239].\nUpper\nExtremity\nArea\nCommon Injuries Key\nCharacteristics\nManagement\nConsiderations\nClavicle Fracture

Specific Musculoskeletal Injuries: Pelvis and Lower Extremities\nPelvis fractures often result from direct compression (heavy blow) [240].\nMay be accompanied by life-threatening blood loss from lacerated vessels\n[242].\nSeveral liters of blood can drain into the pelvic and retroperitoneal space\n[243].\nCan result in significant hypotension, shock, and death [246].\nPelvic fractures can lacerate the rectum, vagina, and bladder [248].\nSuspect in patients with high velocity injury and lower back or abdomen\ndiscomfort [249].\nDeformity or swelling may be hard to see [252].\nThe most reliable sign is tenderness or instability on compression and\npalpation [253].\nStabilize isolated pelvic fractures in stable patients with a long backboard\nor scoop stretcher [255].\nHip dislocations involve a very stable ball and socket joint [257].\nDislocate only after significant injury [258].\nMost are posterior, often from a motor vehicle crash driving the femur\nposteriorly [259].\nAssociated with distinctive signs: severe pain, resistance to movement,\ntenderness, palpation of femoral head in buttocks [260].\nDo not attempt to reduce a dislocated hip in the field unless directed by\nmedical control [261].\nSplint the dislocation in the position of deformity [262].\nPlace the patient supine on a long backboard [262].\nSupport the affected limb with pillows/blankets to secure it to the\nbackboard [263].\nProximal femur fractures are common, especially in older people and those\nwith osteoporosis [264].\nThe break goes through the neck or proximal shaft of the femur [264].\nPatients have characteristic deformity: externally rotated leg, injured limb\nshorter than the uninjured [266].\nUnable to walk or move the leg [267].\nHip region is tender on palpation [267].\nGentle rolling causes pain but no further damage [267].\nAssess the pelvis for soft tissue injury [268].\nBandage, splint the lower extremity, and transport [268].\nSignificant blood loss is possible; treat with high flow oxygen, monitor vital\nsigns, and watch for shock [270].\nFemoral shaft fractures can occur anywhere from the hip to the knee [271].\nLarge thigh muscles spasm, attempting to splint the unstable limb [272].\nMuscle spasm produces significant limb deformity [272].\nfractures may be open, with significant blood loss [273].\nHypovolemic shock is not unusual due to severe deformity [273].\nBone fragments may penetrate or press on nerves and vessels, causing\ndamage [274].\nCarefully and periodically assess distal neurovascular function [274].\nCover wounds with a dry, sterile dressing [275].\nBest stabilized with a traction splint (e.g., Sager splint) [275].\nTraction splints secure femur shaft fractures characterized by pain,\nswelling, and mid-thigh deformity [278].\nExcessive traction can harm an uninjured limb [279].\nGoals of inline traction: stabilize fragments, prevent excessive movement,\nalign limb for splinting, avoid neurovascular compromise [280].\nDo NOT use a traction splint for upper extremity injuries, injuries\nnear/involving the knee, pelvic injuries, partial amputations with bone\nseparation, or lower leg/foot/ankle injuries [282].\nKnee ligament injuries are common as the knee is vulnerable [286].\nRange from mild sprains to complete dislocations [287].\nOccur when abnormal bending and twisting forces are applied [288].\nPatient reports joint pain and cannot use the extremity normally [289].\nSwelling, bruising, tenderness, and fluid in the joint are generally present\n[289].\nSplint all suspected knee ligament injuries [290].\nThe splint should extend from the hip joint to the foot [291].\nStabilize the bone with the injured joint and the bone below it [292].\nVarious splints can be used, including padded rigid long leg splints or two\npadded board splints [293].\nKnee dislocations are true emergencies that may threaten the limb [294].\nLigaments providing support may be damaged or torn [295].\nAlways check distal circulation carefully before other steps [296].\nDirection of dislocation refers to the tibia\u0027s position relative to the femur\n[297].\nPosterior knee dislocations are most common [298].\nMedial dislocations result from a direct blow to the lateral leg [299].\nPatients complain of knee pain and report the knee \"gave out\" [300].\nComplications include limb-threatening popliteal artery disruption, nerve\ninjuries, and joint instability [301].\nIf adequate distal pulses are present, splint the knee in the position found\nand transport promptly [302].\nMedical control may instruct you to attempt realigning a deformed,\npulseless limb to reduce popliteal artery compression and restore\ncirculation [303].\nfractures about the knee occur at the distal femur, proximal tibia, or patella\n[305].\nIf adequate distal pulses are present and no significant deformity, splint\nthe limb with the knee straight [306].\nIf an adequate pulse is present with significant deformity, splint the knee in\nthe position of deformity [307].\nIf the pulse is absent below the injury, suspect vascular/nerve damage and\ncontact medical control [308].\nNever use a traction splint if a knee fracture is suspected [309].\nDislocation of the patella usually displaces to the lateral side [310].\nProduces significant deformity: knee held moderately flexed, patella\ndisplaced laterally [312].\nSplint the knee in the position found (often moderately flexed) [313].\nApply padded board splints to medial and lateral aspects, extending from\nhip to ankle [314].\ntibia and fibula injuries involve fractures of the shaft between the knee and\nankle [316].\nOften both bones are fractured simultaneously [316].\nEven a single fracture can cause severe deformity (angulation or rotation)\n[316].\ntibial fractures are relatively common [317].\nStabilize with padded rigid long leg splints or an air splint from foot to\nupper thigh [317].\nCorrect severe deformity with gentle longitudinal traction before splinting\n[319].\nAnkle injuries are common [320].\nRange from simple sprains to severe fracture dislocations [320].\nInjuries causing pain, swelling, localized tenderness, or inability to bear\nweight require physician evaluation [321].\nThe most frequent mechanism is twisting, stretching or tearing ligaments\n[322].\nManage ankle injuries: dress open wounds, assess distal neurovascular\nfunction, correct gross deformity with gentle longitudinal traction to the\nheel, then apply splint [324].\nFoot injuries can result in dislocation or fracture of tarsals, metatarsals, or\nphalanges [325].\nForce of injury can transmit up the leg, causing a lumbar spine fracture\n[325].\nIf foot dislocation is suspected, immediately assess pulses, motor, and\nsensory functions [326].\nIf a pulse is present, immobilize the extremity with a splint, leaving toes\nexposed for neurovascular assessment [327].\nIf pulses are absent, contact medical control [328].\nFoot injuries are associated with significant swelling but rarely gross\ndeformity [329].\nSplint the foot using a rigid padded board, air, or pillow splint, stabilizing\nthe ankle joint and foot [330].\nLeave toes exposed [331].\nElevate the foot about six inches to minimize swelling [333].\n15. Management of Sprains, Strains, Amputations, and\nCompartment Syndrome\nTreat every severe sprain as if it\u0027s a fracture [335].\nGeneral treatment for sprains and strains includes the RICE protocol [336]:\nRest [337].\nIce [337].\nCompression [337].\nElevation [337].\nSplinting [337].\nManagement of amputations [338]:\nControl bleeding and treat for shock [338].\nSurgeons can sometimes reattach amputated parts [339].\nFor partial amputations, immobilize the part with a bulky dressing and\nsplint [340].\nDo not sever any partial amputations [340].\nControl bleeding from the stump; apply a tourniquet if severe [341].\nFor complete amputations, wrap the clean part in a sterile dressing and\nplace it in a plastic bag [342].\nFollow local protocols for preserving amputated parts [343].\nKeep the part cool without freezing or causing frostbite [344].\nTransport the amputated part with the patient to the appropriate hospital\n[345].\nCompartment syndrome is a limb-threatening condition [346].\nCharacterized by local tissue swelling within a compartment [347].\nBlood flow decreases inside the muscle compartment, leading to ischemia\n[348].\nTissues become damaged and can die [350].\nDefinitive treatment is a surgical fasciotomy allowing swollen muscle to\nexpand [351].\nTypically develops 6-12 hours after injury from excessive bleeding,\ncrushed extremity, or rapid return of pulse to an ischemic limb [352].\nSigns and symptoms include pain out of proportion to the injury, pain on\npassive stretch, and altered sensation [353].\nAdditional signs may be pallor and decreased power [354].\nIf compartment syndrome is suspected, splint the affected limb level with\nthe heart [355].\nProvide immediate transport [355].\nReassess neurovascular status frequently during transport [356].\nInjury Type Management Protocol/Key Actions\nSprains and Strains RICE (Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation, Splinting), treat\nsevere sprains as fractures\nAmputations Control bleeding, treat for shock, immobilize partial\namputations, preserve complete amputations\nCompartment\nSyndrome\nSuspect based on pain out of proportion, splint limb level\nwith heart, immediate transport\n16. Review of Key Concepts\nSkeletal muscle is also referred to as striated muscle [357].\nA strain is stretching or tearing of the muscle, not ligaments with joint\ndislocation [358].\nIn an unresponsive patient with a musculoskeletal injury, you will not be able\nto assess sensory function (can you feel this?) [359].\nThe purpose of splinting a fracture is to prevent movement of bony fragments\nand reduce further injury [361].\nFor a conscious, restless patient with closed deformities to both mid-shaft\nfemurs, cool/clammy skin, and weak/rapid radial pulses, the most appropriate\nsplinting technique is securing him to a long backboard to act as a splint [362].\nTo effectively immobilize a fractured clavicle, you should use a sling and\nswath to minimize movement [364].\nWhen treating a patient with severe pain and obvious deformity to their elbow\nafter a fall, the very first thing to do is manually stabilize the injury and assess\nfor PMS (Pulse, Motor, Sensation) [366].\nWhen treating an open fracture, you should cover the wound to prevent\nfurther infection [369].\nOf the musculoskeletal injuries listed, pelvic fractures have the greatest risk\nfor shock due to blood loss because large vessels can be lacerated [370].\nFor an injured patient with a severely painful and deformed left knee that is\nflexed, but distal pulses are present and strong, the most appropriate\ntreatment is to splint the leg in the position it is found [373].",

Introduction to Environmental Emergencies\nenvironmental emergencies occur when the body cannot cope with surrounding\nfactors like temperature and atmospheric pressure . These situations can lead to\nmedical emergencies . Certain groups are more vulnerable, including children, older\npeople, those with chronic illnesses, and young adults who overexert themselves .\nenvironmental emergencies often happen alongside other injuries or illnesses .\nExamples of these emergencies include heat and cold-related issues, water\nemergencies, pressure-related injuries from diving or altitude, and injuries from\nlightning strikes and venomous bites/stings .\n2.

Cold exposure can injure the hands, feet, ears, nose, or the whole\nbody .\nMechanism of Heat\nLoss\nDescription\nConduction Transfer of heat by direct contact with a colder object\nConvection Transfer of heat to circulating air moving across the\nbody\nEvaporation Conversion of liquid to gas\nRadiation Transfer of heat by radiant energy\nRespiration Heat loss as warm air is exhaled and cool air is inhaled\nhypothermia happens when the body\u0027s core temperature falls below 95 degrees .\nThe body loses its ability to regulate temperature and generate heat . To protect\nagainst heat loss, blood vessels in the skin constrict, causing blue lips or fingertips .\nThe body shivers to generate heat . If these mechanisms fail, body functions slow,\nmental status declines, and vital organs like the heart slow down, which can lead to\ndeath . hypothermia can develop quickly, such as with cold water immersion . It can\noccur even when air temperature is not below freezing . Higher risk populations\ninclude homeless individuals, those without home heating, swimmers, geriatric and ill\npatients, and patients with specific medical conditions like burns, shock, head injury,\nstroke, generalized infections, spinal cord injuries, diabetes, and hypoglycemia .\nLocal cold injuries are usually confined to exposed body parts . frostnip and\nimmersion foot (trench foot) occur when parts are very cold but not frozen .\nfrostbite occurs when tissues are frozen . Severity depends on exposure duration,\ntemperature, and wind velocity . Factors like wet conditions, inadequate insulation,\nrestricted circulation, fatigue, poor nutrition, alcohol/drug abuse, hypothermia,\ndiabetes, cardiovascular disease, and age also play a role . Patients with hypothermia\nshould be checked for frostbite and other local cold injuries .\nfrostnip: Cold skin freezes, but deeper tissues are unaffected. It often affects\nthe ears, nose, and fingers and is usually not painful. Patients may not realize\nthe injury has occurred.\nimmersion foot: Occurs after prolonged exposure to cold water. Signs include\npale, cool skin, wrinkled skin (sometimes remaining soft), and loss of feeling in\nthe injured area.\nfrostbite: The most serious local cold injury as tissues are frozen. Freezing\ncauses permanent cell damage, and gangrene may require surgical removal\nof dead tissue. Affected parts become inflamed and tender to touch.\nFrostbitten parts are often hard and waxy. Blisters and swelling may be\npresent. In superficial frostbite, only the skin is frozen; in deep frostbite,\ndeeper tissues are frozen.\n3. Assessment and Management of Cold-Related Emergencies\nAssessing cold injuries involves noting environmental conditions like wind chill and\nwetness . Ensure scene safety, identify hazards, and use standard precautions . In\nthe primary assessment, form a general impression and perform a rapid scan for life\nthreats . Quickly assess core temperature if the chief complaint is coldness . Evaluate\nmental status using AVPU .\nStages of\nHypothermia\nCore\nTemperature\n(Fahrenheit)\nSigns and Symptoms\nMild \u003e 93.2 but \u003c 98 Alert, shivering, rapid pulse/respirations,\nskin red/pale/cyanotic\nModerate 86 to 93.2 Shivering stops, decreased muscle activity,\ndeteriorating mental status\nSevere \u003c 86 Lethargic, stops fighting cold, stiff/rigid\nappearance\nCore Temp \u003c 80 \u003c 80 Pulse slows/weakens, respirations\nslow/absent, cardiac dysrhythmias\npossible, pupillary action slow, may appear\ndead\nIf cardiac arrest is suspected, begin chest compressions . Ensure an adequate airway\nand breathing; assist with BVM if breathing is slow or shallow . Warm, humidified\noxygen helps rewarm the patient internally . Palpate for the carotid pulse for up to 60\nseconds . CPR is recommended for patients with no detectable pulse or breathing .\nPerfusion may be compromised, and bleeding may be hard to find . All hypothermic\npatients require immediate transport due to complications like cardiac dysrhythmias\nand blood clotting issues . Handle patients gently to avoid causing a cold heart to\nfibrillate . If transport is delayed, protect the patient from further heat loss .\nHistory taking includes investigating the chief complaint and obtaining medical\nhistory . Note the duration of exposure, medications, and underlying medical\nproblems . Secondary assessment involves focusing on hypothermia severity and\naffected areas . Pay attention to skin temperature, texture, and turgor . Vital signs\nindicate severity . Slow, shallow respirations can cause low oxygen . Low blood\npressure and slow pulse may indicate moderate to severe hypothermia . Evaluate\nmental status using AVPU . Use a hypothermia thermometer based on local protocol .\nReassessment involves repeating the primary assessment, checking vitals and chief\ncomplaint, and monitoring consciousness and vital signs . Rewarming can cause\ncardiac dysrhythmias .\nManagement of cold emergencies starts with moving the patient from the cold\nenvironment . Remove wet clothing and cover the patient with dry blankets . Provide\nwarm, humidified oxygen if available . Handle gently; do not massage extremities . Do\nnot allow the patient to eat or use stimulants .\nMild hypothermia: Passive rewarming is appropriate. Place the patient in a\nwarm environment and remove wet clothing. Apply heat packs/hot water\nbottles to groin, axillary, and cervical regions. Increase ambulance\ncompartment heat. Give warm fluids by mouth if the patient can swallow.\nModerate/Severe hypothermia: Do not actively rewarm. Rewarming can\ncause fatal cardiac dysrhythmias. The goal is to prevent further heat loss.\nRemove the patient immediately from the cold and remove wet clothing.\nCover with blankets and transport. Handle very gently to decrease ventricular\nfibrillation risk. If unable to move immediately, shelter the patient from wind\nand contact with cold objects. Cover with blankets and a waterproof cover,\nincluding the head and neck.\nEmergency care for local cold injuries includes removing the patient from the cold .\nHandle the injured part gently and protect it . Remove wet or restrictive clothing .\nConsider active rewarming if there is no risk of re-injury or if transport is significantly\ndelayed, and if local protocols allow . Consult medical control .\nfrostnip: Contact with a warm object may be sufficient.\nimmersion foot: Remove wet footwear, gradually rewarm the foot, and\nprotect it from further cold. Cover loosely with a dry sterile dressing. Never\nrub or massage injured tissues as this can cause more damage. Do not reexpose\nthe injury to cold.\nfrostbite: Remove clothing from the injured part. Cover loosely with a dry\nsterile dressing. Do not break blisters or rub the area. Do not apply heat or\nrewarm the part. Do not allow the patient to stand or walk on a frostbitten\nfoot. If hospital care is delayed and medical control advises field rewarming,\nuse a warm water bath immersion at 102-104 degrees. Dress the area with a\nsterile dry dressing, including between injured fingers/toes. Expect severe\npain. Never attempt rewarming if there is any chance the part might freeze\nagain.\n4. Heat-Related Emergencies: Physiology and Types\nIn hot environments or during vigorous activity, the body tries to eliminate heat\nthrough sweating and dilation of blood vessels . Removing clothing and moving to a\ncooler environment also helps . hyperthermia is a core temperature at or above 101\ndegrees Fahrenheit .\nRisk Factors for Heat Illness\nHigh air temperature reduces radiation\nHigh humidity reduces evaporation\nLack of acclimation to heat\nVigorous exercise causes fluid and electrolyte loss\nChildren, especially newborns and infants\nGeriatric patients\nPatients with heart disease, COPD, diabetes, dehydration, obesity, or limited\nmobility\nAlcohol and certain drugs cause dehydration and decrease sweating\nThere are three forms of heat emergencies: heat cramps, heat exhaustion, and\nheat stroke . All three can be present in the same patient . High-risk individuals are\nsimilar to those at risk for cold illnesses .\nHeat Cramps: Painful muscle spasms occurring after vigorous exercise. They\ndon\u0027t only occur when it\u0027s hot. The exact cause is unclear. They occasionally\noccur in leg or abdominal muscles.\nheat exhaustion (Heat Collapse): Caused by hypovolemia from losing water\nand electrolytes through heavy sweating. High humidity and exertion in poorly\nventilated areas contribute. Signs and symptoms include dizziness,\nweakness, fainting, nausea, vomiting, headache, cold clammy skin with ashen\npallor, dry tongue, and thirst. Vital signs are usually normal, pulse may be\nrapid and weak, and body temperature is normal or slightly elevated (up to\n104Â°F).\nheat stroke: The least common but most serious heat emergency. It happens\nwhen the body is subjected to more heat than it can handle, and normal\ncooling mechanisms are overwhelmed. Untreated heat stroke is always fatal.\nTypical situations include vigorous activity outdoors, poorly ventilated hot\nindoor spaces, heat waves without air conditioning, and children left in hot\nlocked cars. Signs and symptoms include hot, dry, or flushed skin (sweating\nmay still occur). There is a rapid rise in body temperature (up to 106Â°F).\nChanges in behavior, unresponsiveness, seizures, rapid weak pulse, increased\nrespiratory rate, and cessation of perspiration can occur.\n5. Assessment and Management of Heat-Related Emergencies\nScene size-up for heat emergencies involves an environmental assessment . A heat\nemergency might be secondary to a medical or trauma emergency . Consider calling\nadvanced life support for unconscious patients, altered mental status, or those\nneeding IV fluids . Look for mechanism of injury indicators, protect yourself from\nheat/biological hazards, stay hydrated, and use standard precautions .\nSigns and Symptoms\nof Heat Emergencies\nHeat\nCramps\nHeat Exhaustion Heat Stroke\nMuscle Spasms Yes No No\nDizziness, Weakness,\nSyncope\nNo Yes No (often\nunresponsive)\nNausea, Vomiting,\nHeadache\nNo Yes Yes\nSkin Appearance Normal Cold, clammy,\nashen pallor\nHot, dry/flushed\n(may still sweat)\nBody Temperature Normal Normal or slightly\nelevated (up to\n104Â°F)\nRapid rise (up to\n106Â°F)\nMental Status Alert May be altered Altered,\nunresponsive,\nseizures\nPulse Normal Rapid, weak Rapid, weak\n(becomes weaker)\nRespirations Normal Normal Increased\nPerspiration Yes Yes (heavy) May stop\nPrimary assessment starts with a general impression and observing patient\ninteraction . Assess mental status using AVPU . Ensure a patent airway in responsive\npatients; position unresponsive patients to protect the airway . Insert an oral airway\nand provide BVM ventilations for unresponsive patients . Assess perfusion and\nbleeding . Assess skin condition and treat for shock by removing from heat and\npositioning . If bleeding, manage according to protocol . Transport rapidly for heat\nstroke signs .\nHistory taking includes investigating the chief complaint, obtaining medical history,\nand noting factors predisposing to dehydration or heat problems . Determine\nheat/humidity exposure and activities before symptom onset . Secondary\nassessment involves a full body exam for unresponsive patients or a focused exam\nfor conscious patients . Assess for muscle cramps, confusion, mental status, and vital\nsigns . Pay attention to skin temperature, turgor, and moisture . Perform a careful\nneurologic exam . Vital signs may be altered; hyperthermic patients may be\ntachycardic and tachypneic . Falling blood pressure indicates shock . Skin\ntemperature can be normal/cold/clammy in heat exhaustion and hot in heat stroke .\nCheck temperature with a thermometer and pulse oximetry .\nReassessment involves repeating the primary assessment and watching for\ndeterioration . Transport heat stroke patients immediately in a cool ambulance .\nPassively cool by removing clothing and actively cool by spraying water and fanning .\nMonitor vital signs every five minutes and evaluate interventions . Avoid overcooling .\nNotify the receiving facility early about a heat stroke patient . Document\nenvironmental conditions and prior activities .\nManagement of heat emergencies:\nHeat Cramps: Remove the patient from the hot environment and loosen\nclothing. Administer high-flow oxygen. Have the patient sit or lie down until\ncramps subside. Replace fluids by mouth. Cool the patient with water\nspray/mist and fan. Activity can resume when cramps are gone. Hydration by\ndrinking water is the best prevention and treatment. Transport if cramps\npersist.\nheat exhaustion: Treat according to specific steps (skill drill 33-1).\nheat stroke: Recovery depends on treatment speed. The objective is to lower\nbody temperature by any means. Move the patient out of the hot environment\nand into the ambulance. Set AC to maximum cooling and remove clothing.\nAdminister high-flow O2 and assist ventilations if needed. Provide cold water\nimmersion if possible. Spray with cool water and fan aggressively to\nevaporate moisture. Exclude other causes of altered mental status and check\nblood glucose if possible. Transport immediately and notify the hospital. Do\nnot overcool. Call for advanced life support if the patient shivers.\n6. Water-Related Emergencies: Drowning and Diving\nDrowning is respiratory impairment from submersion or immersion in liquid . Risk\nfactors include alcohol, seizure disorders, geriatric patients with cardiovascular\ndisease, and unsupervised access to water for children . Drowning often follows\npanic in the water, leading to fatigue and sinking . It can happen in shallow water . A\nlaryngospasm (spasm of larynx and vocal cords) may occur, meant to prevent water\nfrom entering the lungs . Severe cases lead to progressive hypoxia and\nunconsciousness .\nSpinal injuries in submersion incidents should be suspected if the submersion\nresulted from a diving mishap or fall, the patient is unconscious with no information to\nrule out neck injury, or the conscious patient complains of weakness, paralysis, or\nnumbness in arms/legs . Most spinal injuries in diving incidents affect the cervical\nspine . Stabilize suspected injuries while the patient is still in the water .\nDiving emergencies can be serious, occurring with or without gear . They are\ncategorized into descent, bottom, and ascent emergencies .\nDescent Emergencies: Caused by increased pressure as a person dives\ndeeper. Commonly affected areas are lungs, sinus cavities, middle ear, teeth,\nand area under the mask. Pain (\"squeeze problems\") usually forces divers to\nreturn to the surface to equalize pressure. Pain persisting after returning to\nthe surface, especially in the ear, requires transport as a ruptured eardrum\nmay have occurred. Cold water entering the middle ear through a ruptured\neardrum can cause loss of balance and orientation. The diver may shoot to\nthe surface, leading to ascent problems.\nBottom Emergencies: Rarely occur and are usually due to faulty gear\nconnections or accidental carbon monoxide in the air supply. They can cause\ndrowning or necessitate rapid ascent.\nAscent Emergencies: The most serious and often require aggressive\nresuscitation.\nAir Embolism: The most dangerous and common scuba diving\nemergency. Air bubbles enter blood vessels. It happens when a diver\nholds their breath during rapid ascent. Air pressure in the lungs stays high\nwhile external pressure decreases, causing alveoli to rupture, potentially\nleading to pneumothorax or air embolism. Signs and symptoms include\nblotching of the skin, froth at the nose/mouth, severe pain in\nmuscles/joints/abdomen, dyspnea/chest pain, dizziness, nausea, vomiting,\ndifficulty speaking, cough, cyanosis, vision problems, paralysis/coma,\nirregular pulse, and cardiac arrest.\nDecompression Sickness (The Bends): Gas bubbles (especially nitrogen)\nobstruct blood vessels. It results from rapid ascent, diving too long/deep,\nor repeated dives. Nitrogen breathed dissolves in blood and tissues.\nComplications include blockage of tiny blood vessels, depriving parts of\nthe body of blood supply, and severe pain in tissues/spaces. Signs include\nabnormal joint pain causing the patient to \"double up\". Distinguishing\nbetween air embolism and decompression sickness can be difficult. Air\nembolism usually occurs immediately upon reaching the surface, while\ndecompression sickness signs may appear hours later. Emergency\ntreatment for both involves basic life support and recompression in a\nhyperbaric chamber.\n7. Assessment and Management of Water-Related Emergencies\nAssessment of diving and drowning emergencies begins with scene size-up and\nsafety . Use standard precautions like gloves and eye protection . Never attempt a\nwater rescue without proper training and equipment . Call for additional resources\nearly . Consider trauma and spinal immobilization .\nAssessment Steps for Water Emergencies\nScene Size-Up: Scene safety, standard precautions, call for additional resources,\nconsider trauma/spinal immobilization, look for mechanism of injury indicators\nPrimary Assessment: Form general impression, assess chest pain, dyspnea,\nsensory changes (diving emergency), determine level of consciousness (AVPU),\nbe suspicious of drug/alcohol use\nAirway and Breathing: Open airway, assess breathing, consider spinal trauma,\nsuction vomit, provide BVM ventilations if inadequate, high-flow oxygen for\nresponsive patients, auscultate breath sounds\nCirculation: Difficult to find pulse, begin CPR/AED, evaluate for shock/perfusion,\nassess for bleeding if trauma suspected\nTransport Decision: Always transport to hospital, inhalation of any fluid can cause\ndelayed complications, decompression sickness/air emboli need recompression\nchamber\nHistory Taking: Investigate chief complaint, medical history, injury-specific\nsigns/symptoms, pertinent negatives, depth/duration/time of dive, previous diving\nactivity\nSecondary Assessment: Examine lungs/breath sounds (responsive), look for\nhidden life threats/trauma (unresponsive), check for decompression sickness/air\nemboli, signs of hypothermia, peripheral pulses, skin\ncolor/discoloration/itching/pain/paresthesia\nVital Signs: Check pulse rate/rhythm/quality (peripheral and central), listen for\nheartbeat, check respiratory rate/quality/rhythm, listen for lung sounds, assess\npupil size/reactivity, oxygen saturation (may be false low)\nReassessment: Repeat primary, monitor for deterioration, assess mental\nstatus/vitals every 5 minutes, document circumstances (submersion time, water\ntemp/clarity, spinal injury possibility), bring dive equipment to hospital\nEmergency care for drowning or diving emergencies starts with rescue and removal\nfrom water . Immobilize and protect the spine if a fall or diving injury is suspected .\nArtificial ventilation should begin as soon as possible, even before leaving the water .\nRemove vomit from the airway . Assist ventilations with BVM or pocket mask .\nProvide chest compressions and use the AED if in cardiac arrest . Administer oxygen\nif the patient is breathing spontaneously . Treat for hypothermia .\nFor conscious patients suspected of air embolism or decompression sickness:\nRemove from water and keep calm . Administer oxygen and consider pneumothorax .\nMonitor breath sounds . Provide prompt transport to the emergency department or\nnearest recompression facility . Treat hypothermia from cold water immersion the\nsame way as hypothermia from cold exposure . Breath-holding syncope in shallow\nwater can lead to loss of consciousness due to decreased stimulus for breathing and\nresults in drowning . Treatment is the same as for a drowning patient .\nPrevention is key . Pools should be fenced, and lack of adult supervision is a\ncommon cause of child drownings . Alcohol is associated with half of teenage and\nadult drownings .\n8. High Altitude Sickness\nDysbarism injuries are caused by differences between atmospheric pressure and\ngas pressure in body tissues, fluids, and cavities . Altitude sickness occurs when\nunacclimated people are exposed to diminished oxygen pressure at high altitudes .\nIllnesses affect the central nervous and pulmonary systems . They range from acute\nmountain sickness to high altitude cerebral edema (HACE) and high altitude\npulmonary edema (HAPE) .\nAcute Mountain Sickness: Can occur above 5,000 feet due to diminished\noxygen pressure and hypoxia. It results from ascending too high, too fast, or\nnot being acclimated. Signs and symptoms include headache, lightheadedness,\nfatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, difficulty sleeping, shortness of\nbreath during exertion, and possibly a swollen face. Treatment is stopping the\nascent and descending.\nHigh Altitude Pulmonary Edema (HAPE): Can happen above 8,000 feet.\nFluid collects in the lungs, hindering oxygen passage into the bloodstream.\nSigns and symptoms include shortness of breath, a cough with pink sputum,\ncyanosis, and rapid pulse.\nHigh Altitude Cerebral Edema (HACE): Can happen above 12,000 feet and\nmay accompany HAPE. It can quickly become life-threatening. Signs and\nsymptoms include a severe, constant, throbbing headache, lack of muscle\ncoordination and balance, extreme fatigue, vomiting, and loss of\nconsciousness.\nTreatment for HAPE and HACE involves descending to a lower altitude, providing\noxygen, and rapid transport . Provide positive pressure ventilation with a BVM for\ninadequate respirations . CPAP may help patients with respiratory distress from HAPE\n.\n9. Lightning Strikes\nAn estimated 25 million cloud-to-ground lightning strikes occur annually in the US .\nLightning is the fifth most common cause of death from isolated environmental\nphenomena . Direct strikes target those in outdoor activities or large open areas .\nMany are indirectly struck near a struck object . The cardiovascular and nervous\nsystems are most commonly injured . Respiratory and cardiac arrest are the most\ncommon causes of lightning-related deaths . Tissue damage usually occurs over the\nskin as the strike duration is short . Skin burns are typically superficial .\nCategories of\nLightning Strikes\nCharacteristics\nMild Loss of consciousness, amnesia, confusion, tingling,\nnon-specific signs, superficial burns\nModerate Seizures, respiratory arrest, dysrhythmias (resolve\nspontaneously), superficial burns\nSevere Cardiopulmonary arrest\nEmergency care and treatment: Protect yourself from being struck . Move the patient\nto a sheltered area . Use reverse triage: prioritize anyone in cardiac or respiratory\narrest first . Stabilize the spine and open the airway with a jaw thrust . If pulses are\npresent, assist ventilation . If in cardiac arrest, use the AED as soon as possible .\nControl bleeding and transport . Patients with signs/symptoms but no obvious life\nthreats should be transported for evaluation .\n10. Bites and Envenomations: Spiders and Insects\nIn the US, only the female black widow and the brown recluse spider deliver\nserious, life-threatening bites .\nCharacteristics of\nVenomous Spiders\nin the US\nBlack Widow Brown Recluse\nSize ~2 inches (legs\nextended)\n~1 inch long\nColor Usually black Dull brown\nMarkings Bright red/orange\nhourglass on belly\nViolin-shaped mark (brown to\nyellow) on back\nHabitat Dry, dim places around\nbuildings, wood piles,\ndebris\nDark areas like corners of old\nbuildings, under rocks, wood\npiles\nBite Pain Sometimes overlooked\n(site may become numb),\nbut usually causes\nlocalized pain\nNot painful at first, becomes so\nwithin hours\nVenom Type Neurotoxic (nerve tissue\ndamage)\nCytotoxic (severe local tissue\ndamage)\nLocal Effects Localized pain, agonizing\nmuscle spasms\n(especially in abdomen)\nSwelling, tenderness,\npale/mottled/cyanotic center,\npossibly small blisters. Scab\nforms, creating a large ulcer.\nSystemic\nSymptoms\nDizziness, sweating,\nnausea, vomiting, rashes,\nchest tightness, difficulty\nbreathing, severe\ncramps. Usually subside\nin 48 hours.\nRarely cause systemic\nsymptoms.\nAntivenom Available, reserved for\nsevere bites due to side\neffects\nNot mentioned as a common\ntreatment\nHigh-Risk Groups Older people, children \u003c\n5\nNot specified as distinctly\ndifferent from general\npopulation\nEmergency Care BLS for respiratory\ndistress, rapid transport,\nbring spider if possible\nBLS, rapid transport, bring\nspider if possible\nStings from bees, wasps, yellow jackets, and ants are usually painful but not a\nmedical emergency . Remove the stinger and venom sac by scraping with a firm\nedge . Use ice packs for pain control . Anaphylaxis can occur if the patient is allergic .\nSigns of anaphylaxis include flushed skin, low blood pressure, difficulty breathing,\nwheezes, hives, or swelling of the throat/tongue . Be prepared to assist with an\nEpiPen auto-injector and support airway/breathing .\n11. Bites and Envenomations: Snakes and Scorpions\nSnake bite fatalities in the US are rare, about 15 per year . Only 19 of approximately\n115 native US species are venomous . Venomous species include rattlesnakes,\ncopperheads, cottonmouths (pit vipers), and coral snakes . Snakes usually bite when\nprovoked or accidentally injured, except for the aggressive cottonmouths . Protect\nyourself with caution and proper gear . One-third of bites from venomous snakes\ndon\u0027t result in significant injury . Venomous snakes have hollow fangs that inject\npoison . Poisonous snake bites typically leave two small puncture wounds with\ndiscoloration, swelling, and pain . Non-venomous snakes leave a horseshoe of tooth\nmarks . Fang marks indicate a poisonous bite .\nPit Vipers: Include rattlesnakes, copperheads, and cottonmouths. They have\ntriangular, flat heads and heat-sensing pits near their nostrils. Fangs are\nhollow teeth connected to venom sacs.\nRattlesnakes: Most common pit viper, often with diamond patterns, can\ngrow large.\nCopperheads: Two to three feet long, red copper color with brown/red\nbands. Inhabit wood piles and abandoned dwellings. Account for most\nvenomous bites in the eastern US. Bites are rarely fatal but venom causes\nsignificant tissue damage in extremities.\nCottonmouths (Water Moccasins): About four feet long, olive brown with\nblack bands. Aggressive water snakes. Fatalities are rare, but tissue\ndestruction can be severe.\nSigns of Pit Viper Envenomation: Severe burning at the site followed by\nswelling and blue discoloration (ecchymosis) within 5-10 minutes,\nspreading over 36 hours. Venom interferes with clotting, causing bleeding\nat distant sites. Other symptoms may include weakness, nausea, vomiting,\nsweating, fevers, fainting, vision problems, altered consciousness, and\nshock if swelling occurs. Mark the edges of swelling with a pen.\nTreatment for Pit Viper Bites: Calm the patient and place in a supine\nposition. Clean the bite area. Apply ice. Consider pressure immobilization\nbandage on an arm/leg. Keep the affected extremity below the heart. Be\nalert for anaphylaxis and treat with Epi auto-injector if appropriate. Do not\ngive anything by mouth. Be alert for vomiting. If bitten on the trunk, keep\nsupine and quiet, transport quickly. Monitor vital signs and mark swelling\nprogression. Treat for shock if signs appear. Bring the killed snake or a\nphoto. Notify the hospital and describe the snake. Transport appropriately.\nIf no envenomation signs, perform BLS, apply a sterile dressing, and\nimmobilize the site. All suspected snake bite patients should go to the ED.\nTreat the wound like a deep puncture to prevent infection.\nCoral Snakes: Small reptiles with bright red, yellow, and black bands around\nthe body. \"Red on yellow will kill a fellow, red on black, venom will lack\" helps\nidentify venomous coral snakes. They inject venom by chewing, leaving\npuncture or scratch wounds. Due to small mouth/teeth, they usually bite small\nareas like fingers/toes. Venom is a powerful neurotoxin causing nervous\nsystem paralysis. Within hours, bizarre behavior and progressive paralysis of\neye movements and respiration can occur. Successful treatment relies on\nsnake identification and respiratory support. Antivenom is available but not\nwidely stocked. Emergency care is the same as for a pit viper bite.\nScorpions are arachnids with a venom gland and stinger . They are rare in the US,\nmostly in the Southwest deserts . With one exception, stings are painful but not\ndangerous, causing localized swelling/discoloration . A specific type of scorpion\u0027s\nvenom can cause severe systemic reactions: circulatory collapse, severe muscle\ncontractions, excessive salivation, hypertension, convulsions, and cardiac failure .\nNotify medical control, administer BLS, and transport rapidly if this type of sting is\nsuspected .\n12. Bites and Envenomations: Ticks and Marine Animals\nTicks are tiny insects that attach to the skin . Found in brush, shrubs, trees, sand\ndunes, and on animals . Bites are not painful, but infectious diseases can spread\nthrough tick saliva .\nDiseases\nTransmitted by\nTicks\nCharacteristics\nRocky Mountain\nspotted fever\nOccurs 7-10 days after bite. Symptoms: nausea, vomiting,\nheadache, weakness, paralysis, cardiorespiratory collapse.\nLyme disease Reported across the US except Hawaii. First symptoms: fever,\nflu-like symptoms, bull\u0027s-eye rash spreading over days/weeks.\nPainful joint swelling (especially knees) can occur and may\ncause permanent disability if untreated. Responds to prompt\nantibiotic treatment. Most common in summer.\nProvide supportive care and transport . If access to care is delayed, remove the tick\nby grasping the head with fine tweezers and pulling straight out . Clean the area with\nantiseptic and save the tick for identification . Do not handle the tick with fingers .\nPatients should follow up with a healthcare provider .\nMarine animal envenomations are common . Stinging cells (nematocysts) are found\nin fire coral, Portuguese man-of-war, sea wasps, sea nettles, true jellyfish, sea\nanemones, and coral . Signs and symptoms include painful red lesions, lesions\nextending in a line, headache, dizziness, muscle cramps, and fainting . Treatment:\nRemove from water . Scrape off tentacles with a stiff object like a credit card . Do not\nmanipulate remaining tentacles . Treat for anaphylactic shock if a systemic allergic\nreaction occurs . Give BLS and transport immediately .\nToxins from spines of sea urchins, stingrays, and spiny fish (lionfish, scorpion fish,\nstone fish) are heat sensitive . Treatment: Immobilize the affected area and soak in\nhot water for 30 minutes . Transport the patient . Be familiar with local marine life if\nworking near the ocean .\nGeneral emergency treatment for marine envenomations: Limit further discharge by\navoiding fresh water, wet sand, showers, or careless handling . Keep the patient calm\nand reduce motion of the affected extremity . Remove remaining tentacles by\nscraping . Immersion in vinegar may help alleviate symptoms . Provide transport to\nthe emergency department .\n13. Conclusion and Review\nThis chapter covered environmental emergencies, including cold exposure,\nhypothermia, frostbite, heat emergencies, drowning, diving emergencies, and\nlightning strikes . Review questions help reinforce understanding of heat loss\nmechanisms, indicators of hypothermia, rewarming techniques, treatment for local\ncold injuries, management of heat emergencies, and recognizing diving-related\nconditions . The concept of reverse triage in lightning strikes is also reviewed,\nprioritizing those in cardiac arrest . Understanding these environmental emergencies\nand their appropriate management is crucial .",

Introduction to Obstetrics and Neonatal Care\nThis chapter focuses on obstetrics and neonatal care.\nIt covers the anatomy and physiology of the female reproductive system\nduring pregnancy.\nYou will learn emergency treatment for childbirth.\nThis includes the stages of labor and normal delivery.\nComplications of pregnancy and neonatal evaluations are also covered.\n2. Anatomy and Physiology of the Female Reproductive System in\nPregnancy\nThe female reproductive system includes several key organs.\nThe ovaries are two glands containing thousands of follicles.\nEach follicle contains an egg.\nOvulation happens about two weeks before menstruation.\nThe fertilized egg implants in the endometrium.\nOrgan Description Function During Pregnancy\nOvaries Two glands, one on each side of\nthe uterus.\nContain thousands of follicles,\neach with an egg. Ovulation\noccurs.\nFallopian\nTubes\nExtend laterally from the uterus,\none per ovary.\nFertilization usually occurs\nhere.\nUterus A muscular organ that encloses\nand protects the fetus.\nProduces contractions during\nlabor, pushes fetus through\nbirth canal.\nBirth Canal Made up of the vagina and the\nlower third of the uterus (cervix).\nPassageway for the newborn\nto the outside world.\nVagina Outermost cavity of the female\nreproductive system, lower part\nof birth canal.\nCompletes the passageway for\nthe newborn.\nPerineum The area between the vagina and\nthe anus.\nN/A\nBreasts Produce breast milk carried\nthrough ducts to the nipple.\nProvide nourishment to the\nnewborn.\n3. The Placenta, Umbilical Cord, and Amniotic Sac\nThe placenta is a disc-shaped structure.\nIt is attached to the uterine wall.\nThe placenta provides nourishment to the fetus.\nIt keeps the woman\u0027s and fetus\u0027s circulation separate.\nSubstances can pass between them.\nAnything the woman ingests can affect the fetus.\nThe umbilical cord connects the woman and fetus through the placenta.\nThe umbilical vein carries oxygenated blood to the fetus\u0027s heart.\nThe umbilical artery carries deoxygenated blood to the placenta.\nThe umbilical cord is the fetus\u0027s lifeline.\nThe fetus develops inside the amniotic sac.\nThis sac is fluid-filled and bag-like.\nIt contains about 500 to 1,000 milliliters of amniotic fluid.\nThe fluid isolates and protects the fetus.\nThe amniotic fluid is released in a gush when the sac ruptures.\nThis usually happens at the start of labor.\n4. Normal Physiological Changes During Pregnancy\nFour major body systems change during pregnancy.\nThese are the respiratory, cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, and reproductive\nsystems.\nHormone levels increase to support fetal development.\nHormones prepare the body for childbirth.\nBody System Changes During Pregnancy\nRespiratory Increased respiratory rates. Decreased minute volumes.\nCardiovascular Overall blood volume increases up to 50%. Heart rate increases\nup to 20%. Cardiac output significantly increased. Speed of\nclotting increases.\nMusculoskeletal Hormones make joints looser or less stable in the third trimester.\nCenter of gravity changes, increasing fall risk.\nReproductive Uterus is displaced, increasing risk of direct fetal injury from\ntrauma. Rapid uterine growth in second trimester. Uterus\npushes up on the diaphragm.\nGastrointestinal Increased risk for gastroesophageal reflux, nausea, vomiting,\nand aspiration.\n5. Complications of Pregnancy\nMost pregnant women are healthy, but complications can occur.\nDiabetes can develop during the second half of pregnancy.\nThis is called gestational diabetes.\nIt usually resolves after delivery.\nHypertensive disorders include gestational hypertension.\nGestational hypertension is high blood pressure without systemic effects.\nSystolic pressure is over 140, diastolic over 90.\nSevere gestational hypertension has systolic over 160, diastolic over 110.\nPreeclampsia can develop after 20 weeks.\nSigns include severe hypertension and persistent headache.\nVisual abnormalities like seeing spots can occur.\nSwelling in the hands and feet is common.\nUpper abdominal or gastric pain may be present.\nAnxiety or altered mental status can happen.\nEclampsia is characterized by seizures due to hypertension.\nTo treat seizures, lay the patient on her side.\nMaintain her airway and give oxygen.\nSuction if vomiting occurs.\nProvide rapid transport and call for ALS.\nTransporting on the left side prevents supine hypotensive syndrome.\nThis syndrome is caused by uterine compression of the aorta and vena cava.\nBleeding can indicate various issues.\nSudden severe abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding in the first trimester\nmight be an ectopic pregnancy.\nAn ectopic pregnancy develops outside the uterus, often in the fallopian tube.\nHemorrhage before labor can be serious.\nIn early pregnancy, it may be a spontaneous abortion (miscarriage).\nIn later pregnancy, it might be abruptio placentae or placenta previa.\nAbruptio placentae is premature placental separation from the uterine wall.\nHypertension or trauma often cause it.\nPlacenta previa is when the placenta covers the uterus opening.\nAny vaginal bleeding in pregnancy is serious.\nTreat for shock if signs are present.\nPlace a sterile pad over the vagina; do not insert anything.\nAn abortion can be spontaneous or induced.\nSpontaneous abortion is pregnancy loss before 20 weeks without\nintervention.\nInduced abortion is elective termination before viability.\nSerious complications are bleeding and infection.\nIf a woman is in shock, treat and transport promptly.\nBring any passed tissue to the hospital.\nNever pull tissue from the vagina.\nAbuse during pregnancy is common.\nIt increases the chance of spontaneous abortion and premature delivery.\nLow birth weight is also more likely.\nThe woman risks bleeding, infection, and uterine rupture.\nPay attention to signs of abuse.\nAbused patients may not be honest about injuries.\nTalk to the patient privately away from a potential abuser.\nSubstance abuse affects the fetus.\nEffects include low birth weight and prematurity.\nSevere respiratory distress or death can occur.\nFetal alcohol syndrome affects infants of women who abused alcohol.\nBe cautious when dealing with addicted patients.\nClues include drug paraphernalia or alcohol bottles.\nStatements from family or the patient can indicate addiction.\nThe newborn may need immediate resuscitation.\n6. Special Considerations for Trauma and Pregnancy\nTrauma involving a pregnant woman means two patients: the woman and\nfetus.\nPregnant women have an increased fall risk.\nHormonal changes loosen joints.\nIncreased uterine weight affects balance.\nRisk/Consideration Details Assessment Points\nIncreased risk of\nfalling\nHormonal changes loosen\njoints; increased uterine\nweight affects balance.\nAssess for signs of falls and\nrelated injuries.\nBlood volume\nchanges\nIncreased total blood\nvolume and heart rate.\nCan lose significant blood\nbefore shock signs appear.\nBe alert for subtle signs of\nshock.\nFetal distress before\nshock\nFetus may be in trouble\nbefore maternal shock\nsigns.\nAssess fetal movement and\nreport changes.\nVulnerability of\nuterus\nUterus vulnerable to\npenetrating trauma and\nblood injuries. Trauma can\nbe life-threatening due to\nrich blood supply.\nSuspect uterine injury with\nblunt or penetrating\nabdominal trauma.\nAbruptio placentae\nrisk\nTrauma is a leading cause.\nEspecially with blunt\ntrauma to the abdomen.\nSuspect with blunt abdominal\ntrauma, vaginal bleeding, and\nsevere abdominal pain.\nSeatbelt injuries Improper positioning can\ninjure mother and fetus.\nCarefully assess abdomen\nand chest for seatbelt marks,\nbruising, or trauma.\nCardiac arrest in\npregnancy\nFocus on CPR and\ntransport. Compressions\nmay be higher on the\nsternum in late pregnancy.\nPerform CPR according to\nprotocols; adjust hand\nplacement in late pregnancy.\nAssessment and\nManagement\nFocus on assessing and\nmanaging the woman.\nSuspect shock based on\nmechanism. Be prepared\nfor vomiting.\nMaintain open airway,\nanticipate vomiting,\nadminister high-flow oxygen,\nensure adequate ventilation,\nassess circulation, control\nexternal bleeding.\nTransport\nconsiderations\nTransport on her left side.\nCall for ALS early.\nTransport to specialty\ncenter if available.\nEnsure proper patient\npositioning for transport.\nRequest additional resources\nas needed.\nGestational age\ndetermination\nHelps determine fetus size\nand uterus position.\nAttempt to determine\ngestational age during\nhistory taking.\n7. Cultural and Social Considerations in Pregnant Patient Care\nCultural sensitivity is important when assessing a pregnant patient.\nCultural values can affect self-care choices during pregnancy.\nThey can also influence birth process plans.\nSome cultures may not allow male healthcare providers to examine female\npatients.\nRespect these differences and honor patient requests.\nThe United States has a high teenage pregnancy rate.\nPregnant teenagers may not know or may deny their pregnancy.\nRemember pregnancy is a possibility when assessing female teenagers.\nRespect the teenager\u0027s privacy and need for independence.\n8. Patient Assessment in Childbirth Emergencies\nChildbirth can become an emergency.\nScene size-up includes standard precautions.\nStandard precautions include gloves, face protection, and eye protection.\nA gown should be used if time permits.\nConsider calling for additional resources.\nDetermine the mechanism of injury or nature of illness.\nAvoid tunnel vision during a call.\nPrimary assessment starts with a general impression.\nDetermine if delivery is imminent.\nAddress other life threats.\nPerform a rapid exam.\nAssess airway and breathing.\nIn uncomplicated births, these are usually not an issue.\nTrauma or medical conditions can cause life threats.\nProvide airway management and high-flow oxygen if needed.\nAssess circulation.\nBlood loss is expected after delivery, but not significant bleeding.\nQuickly assess for life-threatening bleeding.\nBegin treating immediately for shock signs.\nControl bleeding, give oxygen, and keep the patient warm.\nThe transport decision is opposite of load and go if delivery is imminent.\nIf delivery is intimate, prepare to deliver at the scene.\nThe ideal place is the ambulance or the woman\u0027s home.\nThe area should be warm, private, and have room to move.\nIf delivery is not intimate, transport the patient.\nPerform the rest of the assessment en route.\nTransport women in the second and third trimesters on their left side.\nRapidly transport patients with significant bleeding, pain, or hypertension.\nTransport if they are seizing or have altered mental status.\nHistory taking includes a thorough obstetric history.\nAsk for her expected due date.\nInquire about any complications.\nAsk if she has received prenatal care.\nDetermine if a complicated delivery is expected.\nGet the patient\u0027s complete medical history.\nObtain a SAMPLE history.\nAsk about prenatal care specifically.\nIdentify complications during pregnancy.\nDetermine the due date, fetal movement, and contraction frequency.\nGet a history of previous pregnancies and complications.\nDetermine the possibility of multiple births.\nAsk about drug or medication use.\nIf her water has broken, ask about the fluid color.\nGreen fluid may indicate meconium.\nMeconium is fecal stool.\nMeconium can indicate newborn distress.\nAspiration of meconium during delivery is possible.\nSecondary assessment includes a physical examination.\nIf the patient is in labor, focus on contractions and possible delivery.\nCheck for crowning if you suspect imminent delivery.\nDo not visually inspect the vagina if delivery is not imminent.\nObtain a complete set of vital signs and pulse oximetry.\nBe alert for tachycardia, hypo- or hypertension.\nHypertension, even mild, can mean a serious problem.\nReassessment involves repeating the primary assessment.\nFocus on ABCs and vaginal bleeding, especially after delivery.\nObtain another set of vitals and compare them.\nRecheck interventions and treatment effectiveness.\n9. Communication and Documentation in Childbirth Emergencies\nNotify the receiving hospital if delivery is imminent.\nProvide an update on the woman\u0027s and newborn\u0027s status after delivery.\nInclude the patient\u0027s pregnancy status in your radio report.\nThis is for pregnant patients with unrelated complaints.\nIf delivery happens in the field, you will have two patients.\nComplete two patient care reports.\n10. Stages of Labor\nThere are three stages of labor.\nThe first stage is dilation of the cervix.\nThe second stage is delivery of the fetus.\nThe third stage is delivery of the placenta.\nThe first stage begins with contractions.\nIt ends when the cervix is fully dilated.\nThe first stage is usually the longest.\nIt averages 16 hours with the first delivery.\nOther signs of labor include bloody show.\nUterine rupture of the amniotic sac can occur.\nIn true labor, contractions increase in frequency and intensity.\nLabor is longer in a primigravida (first pregnancy).\nIt is shorter in a multigravida (multiple pregnancies).\nA woman may experience false labor (Braxton Hicks contractions).\nThe table on the slide distinguishes true from false labor.\nSome women experience premature rupture of membranes.\nThe amniotic sac ruptures too early.\nThe fetus may not be developed.\nThe patient may or may not go into labor.\nProvide supportive care and transport.\nToward the end of the third trimester, the fetus\u0027s head descends into the\npelvis.\nThis positions the fetus for delivery.\nThis descent into the pelvis is called lightening.\nThe sensation may accompany the descent.\nThe second stage begins when the fetus enters the birth canal.\nIt ends with the newborn\u0027s delivery.\nDecide whether to deliver at the scene or transport.\nUterine contractions are usually closer and last longer.\nThe perineum will bulge significantly.\nThe fetus\u0027s head may appear at the vaginal opening.\nThis is called crouching.\nThe third stage begins after the newborn\u0027s birth.\nIt ends with the placenta\u0027s delivery.\nThe placenta must completely separate from the uterine wall.\nThis can take up to 30 minutes.\n11. Normal Delivery Management\nConsider scene delivery when it is intimate.\nThis means it will happen within minutes.\nPrepare for delivery if reaching the hospital is impossible.\nNatural disaster or weather can make transport impossible.\nTo determine imminence, ask specific questions.\nAsk about pregnancy duration and due date.\nAsk if it\u0027s her first pregnancy.\nInquire about contractions: frequency and duration.\nAsk about spotting or bleeding.\nAsk if her water has broken.\nAsk if she feels the need for a bowel movement or to push.\nAsk about previous C-sections or pregnancy problems.\nAsk about drug, alcohol, or medication use.\nDetermine the possibility of multiple deliveries.\nAsk if the physician expects complications.\nIf the patient feels the need to push or move her bowels, prepare for delivery.\nVisually inspect the vagina for crowning.\nDo not touch the vaginal area until delivery is imminent.\nOnce labor starts, it cannot be stopped.\nNever hold the patient\u0027s legs together.\nDo not let her go to the restroom.\nReassure her the bowel movement sensation is normal.\nThis sensation means she is about to deliver.\nYou are only assisting the woman with delivery.\nHelp guide and support the baby as it is born.\nYour vehicle should have a sterile OB kit.\nPosition the patient by removing or pushing up clothing.\nPants and undergarments should be removed.\nPreserve her privacy as much as possible.\nPlace her on a firm surface padded with blankets or towels.\nElevate her hips 2 to 4 inches with a pillow or blanket.\nSupport her head, neck, and upper back.\nHave her keep legs and hips flexed with feet flat.\nHer knees should be spread apart.\nWhen preparing in the field, put on a face shield and gown.\nPlace towels or sheets on the floor to soak up fluids.\nOpen the OB kit carefully to maintain sterility.\nUse sterile sheets from the kit to make a delivery field.\nYour partner should be at the patient\u0027s head to comfort her.\nAdminister oxygen if the patient allows.\nNausea is common during delivery.\nSome patients will vomit.\nContinually check for crowning.\nSome patients have precipitous labor and birth (very fast).\nPosition yourself to see the perineal area.\nTime the patient\u0027s contractions.\nRemind her to take quick, short breaths during contractions.\nShe should not strain between contractions.\nEncourage her to rest and breathe deeply through her mouth.\nFollow the steps in skill drill 34-1 to deliver the newborn.\nWhen delivering the head, observe it exiting the vagina.\nProvide support as it emerges.\nPlace your sterile gloved hand over the head\u0027s bony parts.\nControl the delivery of the head.\nContinue to support the head as it rotates.\nDo not poke your fingers into the newborn\u0027s eyes or fontanels.\nAn unruptured amniotic sac should be noted.\nUsually, it ruptures at the start of labor.\nIf not ruptured by crowning, it appears as a fluid-filled sac.\nThe sac will suffocate the fetus if not removed.\nPuncture the sac with a clamp or tear it.\nTwisting it between your fingers can tear it.\nPuncture away from the fetus\u0027s head or face.\nOnly do this procedure when the head is crowning.\nClear the newborn\u0027s mouth and nose with a bulb syringe if required.\nWipe the mouth and nose with gauze.\nCheck for the umbilical cord around the neck (nuchal cord).\nFeel for it with one finger as soon as the head delivers.\nUsually, you can gently slip the cord over the head.\nIf not, you must cut it.\nWhen delivering the body, the head is the largest part.\nOnce the head is born, the body usually delivers easily.\nSupport the head and upper body as the shoulders deliver.\nDo not pull the fetus from the birth canal.\nThe newborn will be slippery.\nThey may be covered with vernix caseosa, a white cheesy substance.\n12. Post-Delivery Care and Placenta Delivery\nFor post-delivery care, if the mother is able, hand the newborn to her.\nPlace the newborn on her abdomen for skin-to-skin contact.\nDry off the newborn.\nWrap him or her in a warm blanket or towel.\nEnsure the top of the head is covered.\nKeep the newborn\u0027s neck in a neutral position.\nWipe the newborn\u0027s mouth with sterile gauze as needed.\nClamp and cut the umbilical cord approximately 60 seconds after birth.\nObtain the first minute Apgar score.\nThe placenta delivers itself usually within minutes after birth.\nIt can take as long as 30 minutes.\nAfter placenta delivery and before transport, place a sterile pad over the\nvagina.\nStraighten the woman\u0027s legs.\nGently massage the woman\u0027s abdomen with a firm, circular motion.\nThis helps slow bleeding.\nPlace one hand cupped over the fundus and the other above the pubic bone.\nRecord the time of birth in your report.\nEmergency situations include if more than 30 minutes pass without placenta\ndelivery.\nExcessive bleeding (more than 500 ml) before placenta delivery is an\nemergency.\nSignificant bleeding after placenta delivery is also an emergency.\nIf any of these occur, transport the woman and newborn promptly.\n13. Neonatal Assessment and Resuscitation\nThe first minute after birth is the golden minute.\nPerform initial steps of newborn care during this minute.\nThese include airway positioning and suctioning if needed.\nDry and warm the patient.\nProvide tactile stimulation.\nNormally, a newborn breathes within 30 seconds.\nThe heart rate should be 100 beats per minute or higher.\nMany newborns need stimulation to breathe and circulate blood.\nPosition the airway in the normal or sniffing position.\nSuction the mouth and then the nose if necessary.\nVigorously dry the head, body, and back.\nRub the newborn\u0027s back.\nGently flick or slap the soles of the feet.\nThis is tactile stimulation.\nIf good tone and ventilation signs are absent after 30 seconds, use positive\npressure ventilations.\nUse a mask for ventilations.\nThe table shows newborn resuscitation steps.\nFor additional resuscitation, observe respiration, skin color, and movement.\nEvaluate heart rate by palpating the umbilical cord base or brachial artery.\nListen to the chest with a stethoscope.\nHeart rate is the most important measure for further resuscitation.\nIf chest compressions are needed, use the hand circling technique for two\npeople.\nPerform bag valve mask ventilation after every third compression.\nUse a compression to ventilation ratio of 3 to 1.\nHands-on CPR is not as effective as ventilation with CPR.\nThe figure shows chest compressions using the hand circling technique.\nIf you see meconium and the newborn is not breathing, quickly suction.\nSuction the mouth then nose after delivery.\nDo this before providing rescue ventilations.\nThe Apgar score assesses a newborn\u0027s status.\nIt is a standard scoring system.\nA number (0, 1, or 2) is assigned to five areas.\nArea of Activity Score 0 Score 1 Score 2\nAppearance Blue/pale\nbody\nPink body, blue\nextremities\nPink body and\nextremities\nPulse Absent Below 100 bpm 100 bpm or higher\nGrimace\n(Irritability)\nNo response Grimace/weak cry when\nstimulated\nCries, pulls away,\ncoughs\nActivity (Muscle\nTone)\nLimp Some flexion of\nextremities\nActive movement\nRespirations Absent Slow, irregular, weak cry Strong cry, good\nbreathing\nThe five areas are appearance, pulse, grimace, activity, and respirations.\nThe total of the five numbers is the Apgar score.\nCalculate the Apgar score at 1 minute and 5 minutes after birth.\nThe highest possible score is 10.\nThe table shows how to calculate the Apgar score.\nSteps for assessing a newborn: quickly calculate the Apgar score for a\nbaseline.\nStimulation should increase the respiration rate.\nIf not, begin bag valve mask ventilations.\nIf breathing well, check the pulse rate.\nFeel the brachial pulse or umbilical cord base.\nAuscultate the chest with a stethoscope.\nThe pulse rate should be at least 100 bpm.\nIf not, begin ventilations with a BVM.\nReassess respirations and heart rate every 30 seconds.\nAssess oxygen via pulse oximetry, best at the right wrist.\nObserve for central cyanosis.\nIf present, administer blow-by oxygen.\nHold oxygen tubing at high flow close to the face.\nSet the flow rate at 5 liters per minute.\nRequest a second unit if the newborn is in distress.\nThis is needed if resuscitation is required.\nIf ventilation is needed, use a newborn bag valve mask.\nEnsure a good mask-to-face seal.\nUse gentle pressure to make the chest rise with each ventilation.\nIf the newborn does not breathe or have an adequate heart rate, continue\nCPR.\nRapidly transport the newborn.\nDo not stop CPR until the newborn responds or is pronounced dead.\n14. Complications of Delivery\nBreech delivery is when the buttocks are delivered first.\nPresentation is the position of the infant at birth.\nMost infants are born head first (vortex presentation).\nThe fetus is at great risk for trauma in a breech delivery.\nProlapsed cords are more common with breech deliveries.\nBreech deliveries usually take longer.\nYou may have time to transport to the hospital.\nIf the buttocks have passed through the vagina, delivery has begun.\nPrepare for a breech delivery the same as a normal one.\nAllow the buttocks and legs to deliver spontaneously.\nSupport them to prevent rapid expulsion.\nLet the legs dangle while supporting the trunk and chest.\nThe head is usually face down and should deliver spontaneously.\nMake a V with gloved fingers in the vagina.\nThis keeps the vaginal walls from compressing the fetus\u0027s airway.\nA limb presentation is when an arm, leg, or foot is delivered first.\nThe head or buttocks are not the presenting part.\nAn infant with a limb presentation cannot be delivered in the field.\nTransport the patient immediately.\nIf a limb protrudes, cover it with a sterile towel.\nNever try to push it back in or pull on it.\nPlace the patient on her back with her head down and pelvis elevated.\nAlternatively, use the kneel-to-chest position.\nA prolapsed umbilical cord comes out before the fetus.\nThis must be treated in the hospital.\nDo not attempt to push the cord back in.\nTry to keep the fetus\u0027s head from compressing the cord.\nInsert your gloved hand into the vagina.\nGently push the fetus\u0027s head away from the cord.\nPlace the woman supine with the foot of the stretcher raised.\nElevate her hips on a pillow.\nWrap a sterile, saline-moistened towel around the exposed cord.\nGive the patient high-flow oxygen.\nTransport rapidly.\nSpina bifida is a developmental defect.\nA portion of the spinal cord or meninges may protrude.\nIt may protrude outside the vertebrae or body.\nCover the exposed area with a sterile, moist dressing immediately after birth.\nThis prevents potentially fatal infections.\nMaintain the newborn\u0027s body temperature.\nMoisture from the dressing can lower temperature.\nMultiple gestations (twins) occur once every 30 births.\nTwins are usually smaller than single fetuses.\nDelivery is typically not difficult.\nAbout 10 minutes after the first birth, contractions resume.\nThe birth process repeats for the second twin.\nThe procedure for delivering twins is the same as a single fetus.\nYou will need supplies from additional OB kits.\nClamp and cut the cord of the first newborn immediately after birth.\nDo this before the second delivery.\nRecord the birth time of each twin separately.\nTwins may look premature due to their size.\nPremature births are before 8 months (36 weeks).\nA newborn weighing less than 5 pounds is premature.\nA premature newborn is smaller and thinner than a full-term one.\nThe head is proportionally larger.\nVernix caseosa is absent or minimal.\nThere is less body hair.\nPremature newborns need special care.\nThey often require resuscitation.\nPerform resuscitation unless physically impossible.\nPremature newborns as small as one pound have survived with care.\nThey can develop normally.\nPost-term pregnancy lasts longer than 41 weeks.\nPostterm fetuses can be larger, sometimes 10 pounds or more.\nLarger size can cause problems for the woman and fetus.\nLabor and delivery can be more difficult.\nThere\u0027s an increased chance of fetal injury.\nA C-section is more likely required.\nThe woman risks perineal tears and infection.\nPostterm newborns risk meconium aspiration and infections.\nBeing stillborn is also a risk.\nNewborns may not have developed normally due to uterine size restriction.\nBe prepared to resuscitate the newborn.\nRespiratory and neurologic functions may be affected.\nFetal demise is when the fetus has died in utero.\nLabor onset may be premature but progresses normally.\nAn extremely foul odor may indicate an inner uterine infection.\nThe delivered fetus may have skin blisters and sloughing.\nDark discoloration can be present.\nThe head will be soft and perhaps grossly formed.\nDo not attempt to resuscitate an obviously dead neonate.\n15. Postpartum Complications\nPostpartum complications can arise after childbirth.\nExcessive bleeding is when bleeding exceeds 100 milliliters.\nIf bleeding continues after placenta delivery, massage the uterus.\nTreat signs and symptoms of shock.\nExcessive bleeding is usually because uterine muscles aren\u0027t fully contracted.\nIt is potentially life-threatening.\nCover the vagina with a sterile pad, changing it often.\nConsider oxygen if necessary.\nMonitor vital signs frequently.\nTransport the patient immediately.\nNever hold the woman\u0027s legs together to control bleeding.\nDo not pack anything into the vagina.\nPostpartum patients are at increased risk of a venous emboli.\nMost commonly, this is a pulmonary embolism.\nA pulmonary embolism is a clot that travels through the bloodstream.\nIt lodges in the pulmonary circulation.\nThis blocks blood flow to the lungs.\nIt is potentially life-threatening.\nIf a woman reports sudden difficulty breathing after delivery, consider\npulmonary embolism.\nSuspect pulmonary embolism in women of childbearing age with respiratory\ncomplaints.\nEspecially consider it if they recently delivered.\nSudden onset of difficulty breathing or altered mental status is a sign.\n16. Review Questions and Key Takeaways\nThe first stage of labor ends when the presenting part of the baby is visible.\nA 23-year-old woman 24 weeks pregnant with hand edema, headache, and\nvisual disturbances with high blood pressure is likely experiencing\npreeclampsia.\nEclampsia is when a patient has seizures from high blood pressure.\nTo prevent supine hypotensive syndrome in an 8-month pregnant woman,\ntransport her on her left side.\nImmediately after the infant\u0027s head delivery, check the umbilical cord position\nfor a nuchal cord.\nIf the umbilical cord is around the neck, attempt to gently slip it over.\nThe need for newborn resuscitation is based on respiratory effort, heart rate,\nand color.\nAn Apgar score of 8 at one minute indicates a heart rate of 90 (1 point), pink\nbody with blue hands (1 point), rapid respirations (2 points), and resistance to\nstraightening legs (2 points), and active movement (2 points).\nThe score is 1 point for heart rate \u003c100, 1 point for acrocyanosis (pink body,\nblue extremities).\nThe most effective way to prevent cardiopulmonary arrest in a newborn is to\nensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation.\nIf you see an arm protruding from the vagina in a woman in labor, this is a limb\npresentation.\nCover the limb and transport immediately.\nA newborn is considered term if born after 37 weeks and before 42 weeks.",

Introduction to Pediatric Emergencies\nTreating children is different from treating adults.\nChildren vary anatomically, physically, and emotionally from adults.\nTheir illnesses and injuries differ based on age and development.\npediatrics is the specialized medical practice for young patients.\nCaring for children can be challenging due to their age and developmental level.\nChildren may not be able to describe what is wrong.\nFear of EMS providers and pain can make assessment difficult.\nParents or caregivers may be stressed or frightened.\n2. Communication and Family Support\nCaring for a child means caring for both the patient and caregivers.\nFamily members often need emotional support.\nA calm parent helps the child remain calm.\nAgitated parents can make a child\u0027s care more difficult.\nRemaining calm, efficient, and professional is important.\nFor infants, the caregiver can hold the baby during assessment.\nFor toddlers, reassure them with simple words and a calm voice if a parent is\nunavailable.\nFor preschool-aged children, communicate simply and directly.\nDo not lie to a preschooler as it harms trust.\nFor school-aged children, talk to the child, not just the caregiver.\nGive school-aged children simple explanations about pain.\nAsk school-aged children\u0027s parents for distraction advice.\nFor adolescents, allow them to be involved in their own care.\nAllow adolescents to speak openly and ask questions.\nMaintain professional composure when dealing with sensitive issues like sexual abuse.\nAfter a child\u0027s death, support the grieving family.\nLearn and use the child\u0027s name.\nSpeak to the family at eye level and maintain contact.\nUse the word \"dead\" or \"died\" when informing the family.\nAcknowledge the family\u0027s feelings.\nOffer to call family members.\nKeep instructions short and simple.\nAsk if family members want to hold the child.\nWrap the child in a blanket if the family holds them.\nDo not remove tubes or equipment if the family is present.\n3. Growth and Development Stages\nChildhood extends from birth to age 18.\nChildren\u0027s thoughts and behaviors are grouped into five stages.\nStage Ages Key Considerations\nInfancy First year Rapid growth; cannot differentiate strangers from parents;\ncrying is main expression. Relatively larger head predisposes\nto hypothermia. Mobility increases danger. May cry if\nseparated from parents.\nToddler 1 to 3 years Rapid growth and development; explorers by nature,\nincreasing injuries. Lack of molars increases choking risk.\nStranger anxiety; may resist separation from caregiver.\nDifficulty describing pain; use visual scales.\nPreschool\nAge\n3 to 6 years Rich imagination; fearful about pain; may believe injury is\npunishment. Can understand directions; describe painful\nareas. Much history still from caregivers. Modesty\ndeveloping.\nSchool Age 6 to 12\nyears\nBegin to understand death is final. Assessment more like an\nadult. Talk to the child; give simple explanations for pain.\nUnderstand physical and emotional pain.\nAdolescence 13 to 18\nyears\nPhysically similar to adults, emotionally still children. Time of\nexperimentation and risk behaviors. Can understand complex\nconcepts; allow involvement in care. Clear understanding of\npain.\n4. Pediatric Anatomy and Physiology Differences\nSystem Pediatric Characteristics Adult Comparison Source\nRespiratory Smaller airway diameter and\nlength; smaller lungs. Heart\nopening higher and more\nanterior. Larger and rounder\nocciput. Tongue larger relative\nto mouth size and more\nanterior. Long, flappy epiglottis.\nTracheal cartilage less\ndeveloped.

Burns\nare generally less severe\nfor the same exposure.\nLower body surface area\nto body mass ratio leads\nto less fluid and heat\nloss.\n5. Patient Assessment Techniques\nAssessment begins at dispatch.\nMentally prepare for approaching and treating a child.\nPlan for pediatric scene size-up and equipment.\nGather information from dispatch like age, gender, location, MOI/NOI, and chief\ncomplaint.\nNote the patient\u0027s position.\nComplete an environmental assessment for safety threats.\nUse the pediatric assessment triangle (pat) to determine if the patient is sick.\nThe PAT takes less than 30 seconds to perform.\nIt requires no equipment.\nThe three elements of the PAT are Appearance, work of breathing, and Circulation.\nAppearance assesses muscle tone and mental status.\nLook at level of consciousness, interactiveness, and muscle tone.\nThe mnemonic TICKLES (Tone, Interactiveness, Consolability, Look or gaze,\nSpeech or cry) helps determine if a patient is sick.\nwork of breathing looks for signs of increased effort.\nSigns include abnormal airway noise, accessory muscle use, retractions, head\nbobbing, nasal flaring, tachypnea, and tripod position.\nThe body tries to compensate for oxygenation and ventilation problems.\nCirculation to the skin assesses perfusion.\nPallor (pale skin) is seen in compensated shock, anemia, or hypoxia.\nMottling is another sign of poor perfusion.\nCyanosis indicates decreased blood oxygen.\nFrom the PAT, decide if the patient is stable or unstable.\nIf unstable, assess ABCs, treat life threats, and transport immediately.\nIf stable, continue with the assessment process.\nPerform necessary interventions and discuss transport options.\nPerform a hands-on assessment following X-ABCs.\nX is for exsanguination (life-threatening bleeding).\nA is Airway: ensure it is open and clear. Position in the neutral sniffing position.\nB is Breathing: Look, listen, and feel. Feel for chest rise and fall. Belly breathing is\nadequate in infants.\nC is Circulation: Determine pulse, bleeding, or shock. Palpate brachial or femoral\npulse in infants, carotid in older children. Assess skin temp and moisture, estimate\ncap refill.\nD is Disability: Use AVPU or pediatric GCS to assess level of consciousness. Check\npupil response and symmetrical movement.\nE is Exposure: Remove clothing to observe face, chest wall, and skin. Keep infants\nand young children warm to prevent hypothermia.\n6. Transport Decisions and Considerations\nIf the pediatric patient is stable, obtain history and perform a secondary assessment at\nthe scene.\nTransport and provide additional treatment as needed.\nRapid transport is indicated for specific conditions:\nSignificant mechanism of injury.\nHistory of or capable of serious illness.\nPhysical abnormality noted during primary assessment.\nPotentially serious anatomical abnormality or significant pain.\nAbnormal level of consciousness or altered mental status.\nAny signs or symptoms of shock.\nConsider the type of problem, benefits of advanced life support, local protocols, and\nyour comfort level.\nTransport time to the hospital is also a factor.\nIf the patient\u0027s condition is urgent, transport immediately to the closest facility.\nSpecial facilities (trauma centers, children\u0027s hospitals) provide complete care.\nThe most appropriate facility is not always the closest.\nAsk if you can deliver the patient to the most appropriate facility without risk or delay.\nIf not, transport to the closest facility.\nPatients less than 40 pounds not requiring spinal immobilization should be transported\nin a car seat.\nMount the car seat to the stretcher following manufacturer instructions.\nPatients younger than two must be transported rear-facing due to immature neck\nmuscles.\nFor pediatric patients requiring spinal immobilization, use a long backboard or suitable\ndevice.\nPediatric patients in cardiopulmonary arrest should be on a device that secures to the\nstretcher.\nDo not use the pediatric car seat for patients in cardiac arrest.\nThe goal is to secure and protect the patient during transport.\n7. History Taking in Pediatric Patients\nThe approach to history taking depends on the child\u0027s age.\nFor infants, toddlers, and preschool-aged children, obtain history from the parent or\ncaregiver.\nFor adolescents, most information comes from the patient.\nAsk adolescents about sexual activity, pregnancy, drugs, or alcohol in private.\nQuestion about the immediate illness or injury based on the chief complaint.\nWhen interviewing the caregiver or child about the chief complaint, obtain:\nMechanism of injury or nature of illness.\nHow long the patient has been sick or injured.\nKey events leading to the illness or injury.\nPresence of fever.\nEffects on the child\u0027s behavior and activity level.\nRecent eating, drinking, and urine output.\nChange in bowel or bladder habits.\nPresence of vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, or rashes.\nObtain the caregiver\u0027s name and phone number if they cannot go to the hospital.\nUse the SAMPLE history, adapting questions to the patient\u0027s age and developmental\nstage.\nThe process for obtaining OPQRST is the same as for adults.\nOPQRST questions should also be based on the patient\u0027s age and developmental\nstage.\n8. Secondary Assessment and Physical Exam\nA secondary assessment of the entire body is used when there is potential for hidden\nillness or injuries.\nIt helps identify problems not obvious during the primary assessment.\nUse the DCAP-BTLS mnemonic for the secondary assessment.\nA focused assessment is performed on patients without life-threatening conditions.\nFor infants, toddlers, and preschool-aged children without life threats, assess from the\nfeet to the head.\nFor school-aged children and adolescents, use the head-to-toe approach like adults.\nDuring the physical exam, examine specific areas:\nHead: assess for bruising, DCAP-BTLS, and fontanelles in infants.\nNose: clear nasal congestion as it can cause respiratory distress.\nEars: look for drainage indicating skull fracture.\nMouth: check for bleeding or airway obstruction. Note breath smell for possible\ndiabetes.\nNeck: look for tracheal deviation.\nChest: assess for DCAP-BTLS, listen and feel. Check clavicles.\nBack: look for DCAP-BTLS.\nAbdomen: inspect for distension, palpate for guarding, pain, tenderness. Look for\nseat belt abrasions or bruising.\nExtremities: check pms (Pulse, Motor, Sensation), look for symmetry, and range of\nmotion.\n9. Vital Signs Assessment\nVital signs assess circulatory status but have limitations in pediatric patients.\nNormal heart rates vary with age.\nBlood pressure is usually not assessed in children younger than three.\nAssessment of the skin is a better indicator of circulatory status.\nUse appropriately sized equipment.\nUse a blood pressure cuff covering two-thirds of the upper arm.\nSystolic blood pressure for children 1-10 years old can be estimated as (Child\u0027s age in\nyears x 2) + 70.\nRespiratory rates can be difficult to interpret.\nCount respirations for at least 30 seconds and double it.\nIn infants and children younger than three, evaluate respirations by assessing\nabdominal rise and fall.\nAssess pulse rate by counting for at least a minute.\nNote pulse quality and regularity.\nNormal vital signs vary with age.\nVital Sign Infants (0-\n1 yr)\nToddlers\n(1-3 yrs)\nPreschool\n(3-6 yrs)\nSchool-\nAge (6-12\nyrs)\nAdolescent\n(13-18 yrs)\nSource\nRespiratory\nRate\n30-60 24-40 22-34 18-30 12-26\nPulse Rate\n(bpm)\n100-160 90-150 80-140 70-120 60-100\nSystolic BP\n(mmHg)\nNot\ntypically\nassessed\n(Age x 2) +\n70 est.\n(Age x 2) +\n70 est.\n(Age x 2) +\n70 est.\n90-140\nAssess vital signs in the order: Respirations, Pulse, Blood Pressure last.\nCompare pupil size.\nPulse oximetry measures oxygen saturation.\nReassess vital signs every 15 minutes if stable, every 5 minutes if unstable.\nContinually monitor respiratory effort, skin, and level of consciousness.\nParents or caregivers can assist by calming the child.\nCommunicate and document all information for emergency department personnel.\n10. Respiratory Emergencies\nRespiratory emergencies are the leading cause of cardiopulmonary arrest in children.\nFailure to recognize and treat declining respiratory status leads to death.\nRespiratory distress means the child is working harder to breathe.\nIf untreated, respiratory distress will progress to respiratory failure.\nEarly signs of respiratory distress include behavioral changes like combativeness,\nrestlessness, and anxiety.\nSigns of increased work of breathing include nasal flaring, abnormal breath sounds,\naccessory muscle use, and tripod position.\nAs respiratory failure progresses, breathing efforts decrease.\nChest rise lessens with inspiration.\nThe body has used up energy stores.\nBehavioral changes occur, leading to altered consciousness.\nPatients may have periods of apnea.\nThe heart rate slows due to hypoxic heart muscles.\nRespiratory failure does not always indicate airway obstruction.\nOther causes include trauma, nervous system problems, dehydration, or metabolic\ndisturbances.\nA child\u0027s condition can worsen from distress to failure quickly.\nTreatment for respiratory distress includes supplemental oxygen.\nAssist ventilation with a bag valve mask (BVM) and 100% oxygen if needed.\nAllow the patient to remain in a comfortable position.\n11. Specific Respiratory Conditions\nAsthma: smaller airway passages are inflamed and swell, producing mucus.\nIt is a true emergency if not treated promptly.\nCauses include infection, exercise, cold air, smoke, and emotional stress.\nSigns are wheezing, cyanosis, respiratory arrest, or tripod position.\nTreatment: allow position of comfort, administer supplemental oxygen, administer\nalbuterol (with or without ipratropium) via MDI or nebulizer. Contact ALS and assist\nventilations if needed.\nPneumonia: an infection of the lungs, often secondary to a pre-existing infection.\nCan also result from chemical ingestion, lung injury, or submersion.\nChildren with immunodeficiency are at increased risk.\nSigns: rapid breathing, grunting or wheezing sounds, nasal flaring, tachypnea,\nhypothermia or fever, diminished breath sounds or crackles.\nTreatment is supportive: administer supplemental oxygen and bronchodilator if\nwheezing.\nDiagnosis is confirmed at the hospital.\nCroup: infection of the airway below the vocal cords, usually viral.\nTypically seen in children 6 months to 3 years.\nEasily passed between children.\nStarts with cold symptoms, cough, and low-grade fever.\nHallmark signs: stridor and a seal bark cough.\nResponds well to oxygen or humidified oxygen.\nBronchodilators are not indicated and can worsen the condition.\nEpiglottitis: infection of soft tissue above vocal cords, usually bacterial.\nIncidence decreased with vaccination.\nEpiglottis can swell significantly.\nChildren look ill, report sore throat, high fever.\nOften in tripod position and drooling.\nBronchiolitis: viral infection (often RSV) causing inflammation of bronchioles.\nHighly contagious.\nMore common in premature infants.\nResults in copious secretions requiring suctioning.\nOccurs in the first two years, more common in males.\nBronchioles inflame, swell, and fill with mucus.\nAirways easily blocked.\nLook for signs of dehydration, shortness of breath, fever.\nTreatment: allow position of comfort, administer humidified oxygen, consider ALS\nbackup.\nPertussis (Whooping Cough): bacterial disease spread by respiratory droplets.\nLess common due to vaccinations.\nStarts like a common cold (sneezing, runny nose).\nProgresses to severe coughing with a distinctive whoop sound on inspiration.\nInfants may develop pneumonia or respiratory failure.\nTreatment: keep airway open, transport. Follow standard precautions (mask, eye\nprotection).\n12. Airway Adjuncts and Oxygen Delivery\nAirway adjuncts help maintain the airway or assist ventilation.\nThese include OPAs, NPAs, bite blocks, and BVM devices.\nOral Pharyngeal Airway (OPA): keeps tongue from blocking airway, makes suctioning\neasier.\nUse in unconscious patients in possible respiratory failure.\nDo not use in conscious patients, those with a gag reflex, or who ingested\ncaustic/petroleum products.\nNasal Pharyngeal Airway (NPA): usually well tolerated, less likely to cause vomiting.\nUsed in responsive patients with possible respiratory failure.\nRarely used in infants younger than one year.\nDo not use in patients with nasal obstruction or head trauma.\nPotential problems with airway adjuncts:\nSmall diameter airway can obstruct with mucus, blood, vomit.\nAirway too long can stimulate vagal nerve (slow heart rate) or enter esophagus\n(gastric distension).\nCan cause laryngeal spasm and vomiting if inserted into responsive patient.\nNPA should not be used with facial trauma due to bleeding risk.\nOxygen delivery devices:\nBlow-by technique: provides \u003e21% oxygen at 6 L/min. Not as effective as\nmask/cannula, but better than none.\nNasal cannula: provides 24-44% oxygen at 1-6 L/min. Some children prefer it.\nNon-rebreather mask: delivers up to 95% oxygen at 10-15 L/min. Patient exhales\nCO2 without rebreathing it.\nBag-Valve Mask (BVM): provides nearly 100% oxygen at 10-15 L/min.\nNon-rebreather, nasal cannula, or simple face mask are for patients with adequate\nrespirations.\nPatients with respirations fewer than 12 or more than 60, altered consciousness, or\ninadequate tidal volume need assisted ventilations with a BVM.\nBVM is indicated for patients with respirations too slow or too fast, unresponsive, or\nnot responding purposefully to pain.\nTwo-person BVM is similar to one-person, but one holds the mask and the other\nventilates. It is usually more effective for maintaining a tight seal.\n13. Cardiopulmonary Arrest and Shock\nCardiopulmonary arrest in children is most often associated with respiratory arrest.\nChildren are affected differently by decreasing oxygen than adults.\nFocus on effective CPR, early use of an AED, and transport.\nShock develops when the circulatory system cannot deliver enough blood to vital\norgans.\nIt results in organ failure and cardiopulmonary arrest.\nCompensated shock is the early stage where the body compensates.\nDecompensated shock is the later stage where blood pressure falls.\nCommon causes of shock in children: traumatic injury, dehydration, severe infection,\nneurologic injury, anaphylaxis, heart disease, tension pneumothorax, blood around the\nheart.\nChildren respond to fluid loss differently than adults.\nThey may increase heart rate and respirations, show pale or blue skin.\nSigns of shock in children: tachycardia, poor capillary refill (\u003e2 seconds), mental\nstatus change.\nBegin treating shock by assessing ABCs and intervening.\nIf obvious life-threatening external hemorrhage, the order is CAB (Circulation, Airway,\nBreathing).\nIf cardiac arrest is suspected, the order is also CAB for chest compressions.\nChildren in shock often have increased respirations but blood pressure falls only in\nsevere shock.\nLimit management to simple interventions.\nEnsure airway is open, prepare for artificial ventilation, control bleeding.\nGive supplemental oxygen by mask or blow-by.\nKeep the patient warm.\nProvide rapid transport to the nearest appropriate facility.\nContact ALS backup as needed.\n14. Anaphylaxis and Bleeding Disorders\nAnaphylaxis: a life-threatening allergic reaction involving multiple body systems.\nCharacterized by airway swelling and blood vessel dilation.\nCommon causes: insect stings, medications, food.\nSigns and symptoms: hypoperfusion, stridor, wheezing, increased work of\nbreathing, restlessness, agitation, sense of impending doom, hives.\nTreatment: keep the patient calm, administer oxygen, assist parent with prescribed\nEpi auto-injector. Provide rapid transport.\nHemophilia: a congenital condition where the patient lacks normal clotting factors.\nMostly hereditary and severe.\nPredominantly in males.\nBleeding may occur spontaneously.\nAll injuries become serious due to blood loss as blood does not clot.\nTransport immediately.\nDo not delay applying tourniquets for life-threatening hemorrhage.\n15. Neurologic Emergencies\nUse the AEIOU-TIPS mnemonic for major causes of altered mental status.\nUnderstand normal developmental and age-related changes in behavior.\nListen carefully to the caregiver\u0027s opinion.\nSigns and symptoms of altered mental status vary from confusion to coma.\nManagement focuses on ABCs.\nSeizures: disorganized electrical activity in the brain.\nSubtle in infants (sucking, bicycling movements).\nMore obvious in older children (repetitive muscle contractions, unresponsiveness).\nCommon causes are listed on a slide.\nAfter a seizure, muscles relax, becoming flaccid.\nBreathing is labored during the post-ictal state.\nThe post-ictal state is over when the child regains normal consciousness.\nStatus epilepticus is seizures every few minutes without regaining consciousness\nor lasting over 30 minutes.\nRecurring or prolonged seizures are potentially life-threatening.\nIf seizing or unconscious, protect the patient from harm and call for ALS.\nManagement: Protect the airway (top priority). Place in recovery position if\nvomiting, have suction ready. Provide 100% oxygen (non-rebreather or blow-by).\nBegin BVM ventilations if no improvement. Monitor breathing and consciousness.\nTransport to appropriate facility.\nMeningitis: inflammation of the tissues covering the spinal cord and brain.\nRecognizing it in children is important.\nRisk factors: males, newborns, compromised immune systems, history of\nbrain/spinal cord/back surgery, head trauma, shunts/pins/foreign bodies in\nbrain/spinal cord.\nSigns and symptoms vary by age.\nCommon symptoms in all ages: fever, altered level of consciousness.\nSeizure may be the first sign.\nInfants \u003c2-3 months may have apnea, cyanosis, fever, high-pitched cry,\nhypothermia.\nMeningeal irritation causes pain with movement, often a stiff neck.\nInfant sign: increasing irritability and bulging fontanelle without crying.\nBacterial meningitis can have rapid onset, leading to shock and death.\nBacterial meningitis signs: small, pinpoint cherry red spots or larger purple-black\nrash.\nSuspected meningitis patients are considered contagious.\nFollow standard precautions. Follow up on diagnosis for possible antibiotics if\nexposed.\nTreatment: give oxygen, assist ventilations if needed. Reassess vital signs\nfrequently. Transport to the highest level of service.\n16. Gastrointestinal Emergencies\nNever take a complaint of abdominal pain lightly.\nSignificant bleeding can occur internally without outward signs of shock.\nMonitor for signs and symptoms of shock.\nGastrointestinal complaints are common in children.\nCommon causes: ingestion of certain foods or substances.\nSymptoms: abdominal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.\nVomiting and diarrhea can cause dehydration.\nIf appendicitis is suspected, promptly transport to the hospital.\nObtain history from the caregiver, especially regarding:\nNumber of wet diapers.\nTolerance of liquids.\nFrequency of diarrhea.\nPresence of tears when crying.\n17. Poisoning Emergencies\nPoisonings are common in children.\nOccur via ingestion, inhalation, injection, or absorption.\nCommon sources: alcohol, aspirin, cosmetics, cleaning products (bleach), plants, iron,\nprescription/illicit drugs, vitamins.\nSigns and symptoms vary widely based on substance, age, and weight.\nChild can appear normal initially or be confused, sleepy, or unconscious.\nSome substances are lethal with just one pill in a small child.\nInfants can be poisoned by siblings, parents, or caregivers; be alert for abuse.\nMay be exposed in settings where harmful substances are smoked.\nAfter primary assessment, ask the patient or caregiver:\nWhat substance was involved?.\nApproximately how much and how long ago?.\nAny changes in behavior or consciousness?.\nAny choking or coughing after exposure?.\nContact medical control for assistance in identifying poisons and treatment.\nPerform external decontamination.\nAssess ABCs and monitor breathing.\nProvide oxygen and ventilations if necessary.\nIf signs of shock, position supine, keep warm, and transport.\nMay give activated charcoal per medical control or protocol.\n18. Dehydration and Fever Emergencies\nDehydration: fluid loss is greater than intake.\nMost common causes: vomiting and diarrhea.\nIf untreated, can lead to shock and death.\nInfants and children are at greater risk due to smaller fluid reserves.\nLife-threatening dehydration can occur in hours in infants.\nSigns of mild dehydration: dry lips, decreased saliva, few wet diapers.\nSigns of moderate dehydration: sunken eyes, sleepiness, irritability, loose skin,\nsunken fontanelles.\nSigns of severe dehydration: mottled, cool, clammy skin, delayed cap refill,\nincreased respirations.\nManagement: Assess ABCs. ALS backup is necessary for severe dehydration.\nTransport all patients with moderate or severe dehydration.\nFever: increase in body temperature, usually from infection.\nTemperatures 100.4Â°F or higher are abnormal.\nRarely life-threatening alone, but fever with a rash can indicate serious conditions\nlike meningitis.\nCommon causes: infection, status epilepticus, cancer, drug ingestion (aspirin),\narthritis, systemic lupus, high environmental temperatures.\nResult of increased heat generation and decreased heat loss.\nAccurate body temp is important.\nRectal temperature is most accurate for infants and toddlers.\nSigns may include respiratory distress, shock, stiff neck, rash, hot skin, flushed\ncheeks, seizures, bulging fontanelles (infants).\nAssess for other signs/symptoms.\nProvide rapid transport and management.\nFollow standard precautions if communicable disease suspected.\nFebrile seizures: common in children 6 months to 6 years, caused by fever alone.\nTypically occur on the first day of a febrile illness.\nCharacterized by generalized tonic-clonic seizure activity.\nUsually last fewer than 15 minutes with little or no post-ictal state.\nMay indicate a more serious problem like meningitis.\nManagement: Assess ABCs, provide cooling measures.\nAll patients with febrile seizures need to be seen at the hospital.\n19. Drowning Emergencies\nDrowning is the second most common cause of unintentional death in children 1-4\nyears.\nChildren can drown in pools, lakes, bathtubs, puddles, or buckets.\nOlder adolescents drown while swimming or boating; alcohol can be a factor.\nThe primary result is lack of oxygen.\nLack of oxygen affects heart, lungs, and brain even in minutes.\nSubmersion in icy water can cause hypothermia.\nDiving increases the risk of neck and spinal cord injuries.\nSigns and symptoms vary by submersion time.\nSymptoms: coughing, choking, difficulty breathing, altered mental status, seizure,\nunresponsiveness.\nManagement: request ALS, assess and manage ABCs. Administer oxygen or BVM. If\ntrauma suspected, apply cervical collar and backboard.\n20. Pediatric Trauma Emergencies\nUnintentional injuries are the number one killer of children.\nQuality of care after injury greatly impacts recovery chances.\nChildren\u0027s muscles and bones are still growing.\nAdolescents are prone to extremity fractures.\nFemur fractures are rare but cause major blood loss.\nChildren\u0027s bones and soft tissues are less developed, affecting how force impacts\nthem.\nChild\u0027s head is proportionately larger, exerting more stress on neck during deceleration\ninjury.\nChildren are often injured due to underdeveloped judgment and lack of experience.\nAlways assume serious neck or head injuries in vehicle collisions.\nInjury area depends on child\u0027s height and bumper position.\nSports injuries are common; immobilize the cervical spine for sports-related injuries.\nHead injuries are common due to head-to-body ratio.\nInfant skull is softer and thinner, increasing brain tissue injury risk.\nScalp and facial vessels bleed easily, causing significant blood loss.\nNausea and vomiting are common signs.\nImmobilization is necessary for possible head or spine injury after trauma.\nImmobilization can be difficult due to body proportions.\nChest injuries are often due to blunt rather than penetrating trauma.\nFlexible chest can cause flail chest without external signs.\nSignificant internal chest injuries may be present.\nAbdominal injuries are common.\nMonitor for shock.\nPrevent hypothermia by keeping warm with blankets.\nIf low pulse, ventilate and monitor during transport.\nMonitor all children with abdominal injuries for shock.\nBurns are generally more serious than in adults.\nHigher surface area to mass ratio increases shock risk, hypothermia risk, and\nairway problems.\nCommon causes: hot substances (scalding water, stove), caustic substances\n(cleaners, paint thinners).\nOlder children burned by flames.\nInfection is common; use sterile techniques.\nConsider abuse in any burn situation and report suspicions.\nSeverity: minor (partial thickness \u003c10%), moderate (partial thickness 10-20%),\nsevere (full thickness any %; partial thickness \u003e20%; any burn to hands, feet, face,\nairway, genitalia).\nManagement is the same as adults.\nExtremity injuries: bones are immature with active growth centers (growth plates).\nGrowth plates are potential weak spots.\nIncomplete or greenstick fractures can occur.\nManagement is generally the same as adults.\n21. Pain Management\nThe first step is recognizing that the patient is in pain.\nUse visual clues and the Wong-Baker FACES Pain Scale as some children use nonverbal\nor limited vocabulary.\nPain interventions are limited:\nPositioning.\nIce packs.\nExtremity evaluation.\nThese interventions decrease pain and swelling.\nKindness and emotional support are important tools.\n22. Disaster Management (Jumpstart Triage)\nUse the Jumpstart triage system instead of START triage for pediatric patients.\nIntended for patients younger than 8 or appearing to weigh less than 100 pounds.\nFour triage categories, designated by colors:\nGreen: Minor, not an immediate need for treatment. Able to walk (except infants).\nYellow: Delayed, spontaneous breathing, peripheral pulses, responsive to painful\nstimuli.\nRed: Immediate, apnea and respiratory failure, breathing but without a pulse,\ninappropriate response to painful stimuli.\nBlack: Apnea without a pulse, or apnea and unresponsive to rescue breathing.\n23. Child Abuse and Neglect\nChild abuse: improper or excessive action that harms a child or infant.\nIncludes physical abuse, sexual abuse, neglect, and emotional abuse.\nOver half a million child abuse victims annually.\nMany suffer life-threatening conditions or die.\nYou must report suspected child abuse.\nAbuse is likely to reoccur, potentially causing permanent injury or death.\nAbuse occurs in every socio-economic status.\nBe aware of the surroundings and document findings objectively.\nYou may testify in abuse cases, making accurate records essential.\nAsk yourself questions to identify potential abuse:\nIs the injury typical for the child\u0027s developmental level?.\nIs the reported mechanism of injury consistent?.\nIs the parent or caregiver behaving appropriately?.\nIs there evidence of drinking or drug abuse at the scene?.\nWas there a delay in seeking help?.\nIs there a good relationship between caregiver and child?.\nDoes the child have multiple injuries in different healing stages?.\nDoes the child have unusual marks (cigarettes, heating, branding)?.\nDoes the child have several types of injuries?.\nAre there burns on hands/feet with a glove distribution?.\nUnexpected decreased level of consciousness?.\nIs the child clean and appropriate weight?.\nAny rectal or vaginal bleeding?.\nWhat is the condition of the home (clean, dirty, warm, cold, food)?.\nThe mnemonic CHILD ABUSE helps remember points to look for.\nChild abuse (the mnemonic itself).\nHistory inconsistencies.\nInjuries: multiple types or stages.\nLack of concern from caregiver.\nDelay in seeking care.\nBruises: note color and location; suspicious on back, buttocks, face (usually inflicted).\nBurns: suspicious on penis, testicles, vagina, buttocks (usually inflicted). Burns\nencircling hand or foot (glove distribution) are suspicious. Suspect abuse with\ncigarette burns or grid pattern burns.\nFractures: humerus or femur fractures without major trauma are suspicious. Falls out\nof bed usually don\u0027t cause fractures. Maintain suspicion for femur or complete fracture\nin infants/young children.\nShaken baby syndrome: life-threatening head trauma from shaking or head impact.\nBleeding in head, cervical spine damage from shaking.\nNeglect: refusal or failure to provide necessities. Neglected children are often dirty,\nthin, developmentally delayed.\nBehavioral indicators: withdrawn, fearful, or hostile children. Be concerned if a child\navoids discussing injury cause. Alert for conflicting stories or lack of caregiver concern.\nAbuser can be parent, caregiver, relative, or friend.\nEMTs in all states must report suspected abuse. Most states have special forms.\nSupervisors are generally forbidden from interfering with reporting.\nLaw enforcement and child protective services determine if abuse occurred.\nSexual abuse: victims can be any age or gender. Maintain a high index of suspicion.\nAssessment limited to determining dressing needs for injuries (bruises, fractures). Do\nnot examine genitalia unless bleeding is evident.\nDo not allow child or EMT to wash, urinate, or defecate.\nEnsure same-gender EMT or police officer stays with the child.\nMaintain professional composure.\nObtain as much information as possible.\nTransport all child victims; sexual abuse is a crime.\n24. Sudden Unexpected Infant Death Syndrome (SUIDS/SIDS)\nSudden unexpected infant death (SUID): sudden death where cause is unknown until\ninvestigation.\nOne cause of SUID is Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), death unexplained by\nanother cause.\nAbout 3,500 infants die of SIDS annually.\nRecommendations to reduce SIDS risk: place baby on their back in a crib free of\nbumpers, blankets, toys.\nHave baby sleep in the same room, but not the same bed.\nBreastfeeding and pacifier use are associated with lower risk.\nSIDS risk factors (impossible to predict): mother \u003c20, mothers who smoke, use alcohol\nor drugs, low birth weight.\nSIDS can occur at any time of day.\nEMT tasks in SIDS cases: scene assessment, patient assessment/management,\ncommunication/support for family.\nPatient assessment for a SIDS victim: blue, pale, not breathing, unresponsive.\nOther potential causes to consider: infection, child abuse, airway obstruction,\nmeningitis, accidental poisoning, hypoglycemia, metabolic defects.\nBegin assessment with XABCs. Provide interventions as needed.\nIf signs of postmortem changes are present (depending on time passed), call medical\ncontrol.\nIf no postmortem changes, begin CPR immediately.\nNote any marks or bruises on the child before procedures.\nDocument any interventions not done prior to your arrival.\nScene assessment: inspect the environment, noting conditions where found.\nConcentrate on signs of illness (medications, humidifiers, thermometers), house\ncondition, hygiene, family interaction, and where infant was discovered.\nCommunication and support for the family after death: a devastating event evoking\nstrong emotions in healthcare providers.\nFollow or allow the family to express grief. Offer empathy and understanding.\nFamily may want resuscitation attempts conflicting with protocols.\nIntroduce yourself, ask date of birth and history.\nDo not speculate on the cause of death.\nAsk if they want to hold the child and say goodbye.\nHelpful interventions: use child\u0027s name, speak at eye level, maintain contact.\nUse \"dead\" or \"died\", not euphemisms.\nAcknowledge feelings, offer to call family.\nKeep instructions short and basic. Ask each family member individually if they want to\nhold the child.\nWrap the child in a blanket and stay with them.\nEach culture expresses grief differently. Some require intervention.\nMost caregivers feel responsible for the death.\nSome EMS systems arrange home visits for closure, requiring special training.\nChild\u0027s death is stressful for providers. Take time off, talk to colleagues. Be alert for\nPTSD signs in self/others, consider professional help.\n25. Apparent Life-Threatening Events (ALTES)\nInfants found not breathing, cyanotic, or unresponsive may resume breathing/color\nwith stimulation.\nThis is an Apparent Life-Threatening Event (ALTE).\nCharacteristics: cyanosis, apnea, distinct change in muscle tone, choking, or gagging.\nAfter the event, the child may appear healthy with no signs of illness or distress.\nManagement: strict attention to airway management.\nAssess the infant\u0027s history.\nAllow caregivers to ride in the back.\nPhysicians will determine the cause of this brief, unexplained event.\nSigns and symptoms include brief color changes (pale or cyanosis), choking,\nabsent/low/irregular breathing, abnormal muscle tone, decreased consciousness, no\nabnormality on assessment.\nTransport is required for evaluation.",

Introduction to Geriatric Emergencies and the Aging Process\nYear Projected Population Aged 65+ (Millions)\n2012\ngeriatrics focuses on the assessment and treatment of disease in individuals aged\n65 or older . The population aged 65 and older is projected to nearly double between\n2012 and 2050 . Caring for geriatric patients presents unique challenges due to\nchronic conditions, multiple medications, and the physiological changes of aging .\nHuman growth and development peak in the late 20s and early 30s, after which the\naging process begins . This process is inevitable and includes changes in\nphysiological functions, like a decline in liver and kidney function . All body tissues\nage, and the decrease in functional capacity of organ systems is normal, impacting\nhow a patient responds to illness .\n2. Communication and Generational Considerations in Geriatric\nCare\nUnderstanding and appreciating the life of an older person is important . It requires\ntime and patience to interact with older individuals . Always treat patients with\nrespect and avoid ageism, the stereotyping that can lead to discrimination . Older\npeople can remain fit and active, though not at the same level as in their youth .\nEffective verbal communication is essential for successful assessment and\ntreatment . Communication can be challenging due to conditions like dementia .\nWhen caring for older individuals, use their name or \"sir\" or \"ma\u0027am\".\nAsk how they prefer to be addressed to build trust.\nIdentify yourself and be aware of your presentation.\nLook directly at the patient at eye level in good lighting.\nSpeak slowly and distinctly.\nHave one person talk to the patient, asking one question at a time.\nDo not assume all older patients have hearing loss.\nGive the patient time to respond, unless urgent.\nListen to the answer they provide.\nExplain actions before performing them.\nAvoid talking about the patient as if they are not present.\n3. Common Complaints and Leading Causes of Death in Older\nAdults\nChanging physiology predisposes geriatric patients to unique problems . Simple\ninjuries can have severe consequences .\nCommon Conditions Leading Causes of Death\nChronic Lower Respiratory Disease\nInfluenza\nPneumonia\nHeart Disease\nCancer\nStroke\nAlzheimer\u0027s Disease\nDiabetes\nAccidents/Falls\nA simple rib fracture in an 80 or 90-year-old can lead to pneumonia or death . Hip\nfractures from low-mechanism falls are common with dire consequences . Hip\nfractures are more likely with weakened bones due to osteoporosis or infection .\nSedentary behavior during healing can predispose patients to pneumonia and blood\nclots . Many older people do not return to their pre-injury activity level after a hip\nfracture .\n4. Age-Related Changes in the Respiratory System\nAge-related changes in the respiratory system increase susceptibility to illness .\nAirway musculature weakening can decrease breathing capacity . Alveoli may\nenlarge, losing elasticity and making air expulsion difficult . Slower chemoreceptors\ncause a delayed response to hypoxia . Loss of protective airway mechanisms\nincludes decreased cough and gag reflexes .\nPneumonia is a leading cause of death from infection in older Americans.\nAging causes immune suppression, increasing infection risk.\nIncreased mucus, secretions, and inflammation interfere with oxygenating\nblood.\nManagement is the same as for other patients.\nMaintain high suspicion for geriatric patients with pneumonia signs.\npulmonary emboli are sudden blockages by venous clots.\nPatients may have shortness of breath and chest pain.\nIt can be confused with cardiac, lung, or musculoskeletal issues.\nRisk factors include nursing home residence, hospitalization, trauma,\ncancer, blood clot history, heart failure, pacemaker, paralyzed extremities,\nobesity, smoking, or recent long-distance travel.\nSymptoms include tachycardia, sudden dyspnea, shoulder/back/chest\npain, cough, syncope (with larger clots), anxiety, apprehension, low-grade\nfever, leg pain, redness, unilateral pedal edema, fatigue, and cardiac\narrest.\nTreatment focuses on airway, ventilatory, and circulatory support.\nSupplemental oxygen and ventilation may be needed.\n5. Age-Related Changes in the Cardiovascular System\nSigns/Symptoms Older Adults Younger\nAdults\nMyocardial Infarction Often silent or atypical Classic chest\npain\nHeart Failure (Right-\nSided)\nJugular vein distension, ascites,\nperipheral edema, enlarged liver\nHeart Failure (Left-\nSided)\nPulmonary edema, shortness of breath,\ncrackles, proximal nocturnal dyspnea\nThe heart hypertrophies with age, possibly due to stiffening blood vessels . Cardiac\noutput declines over time due to decreasing stroke volume . Arteriosclerosis\ncontributes to systolic hypertension, burdening the heart . The ability to speed up\ncontractions, increase strength, and constrict vessels decreases with stiffer vessels .\nAtherosclerosis is the buildup of fat and cholesterol in arteries.\nOlder people are at increased risk for aneurysms. Severe blood loss can\noccur if an aneurysm ruptures.\nStiff blood vessels result in higher systolic blood pressure. Stiffening and\ndegeneration of heart valves may impede blood flow.\nChanges in the heart\u0027s electrical conduction system can lead to abnormal rate\nor rhythm.\northostatic hypotension is a blood pressure drop with position change. The\nbody adapts less to rapid postural changes.\nvenous stasis can cause clots, leading to deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary\nemboli. Loss of proper vein function in the legs also occurs.\nMyocardial infarcts (heart attacks) often lack classic symptoms in geriatrics.\nUp to one-third of older patients have silent heart attacks. This is more\ncommon in women and patients with diabetes. Atypical signs include\nepigastric/abdominal pain, loss of bowel/bladder control, nausea, vomiting,\nweakness, dizziness, lightheadedness, syncope, fatigue, and confusion.\nOther signs include diaphoresis, pale/cyanotic/mottled skin, abnormal breath\nsounds, and increased peripheral edema. Treatment involves airway,\nventilatory, and circulatory support, aspirin, and assisting with nitroglycerin.\nHeart failure symptoms vary based on the affected side. Right-sided failure\nshows fluid backup in the body (jugular vein distension, ascites, peripheral\nedema). Left-sided failure causes fluid in the lungs (pulmonary edema,\nshortness of breath, crackles). Proximal nocturnal dyspnea is sudden\nrespiratory distress waking a person at night due to fluid accumulation in the\nlungs. Symptoms include coughing, suffocation feeling, cold sweats, and\ntachycardia. Treatment is airway, ventilatory, and circulatory support.\n6. Stroke in the Geriatric Population\nStroke is a leading cause of death in older people . Preventable risk factors include\nsmoking, hypertension, diabetes, Afib, obesity, and a sedentary lifestyle .\nUncontrollable factors include age, race, and gender .\nSigns and symptoms include altered level of consciousness, one-sided\nnumbness, weakness, or paralysis. Other signs are slurred speech, aphasia,\nvisual disturbances, headache, dizziness, incontinence, and potentially\nseizures.\nHemorrhagic strokes involve bleeding into the brain from broken vessels;\nthey are less common but more fatal.\nIschemic strokes occur when blood clots block blood flow to part of the\nbrain.\nDetermining the onset of symptoms is important. Patients with symptom\nonset within a few hours might be candidates for stroke center therapy.\nA transient ischemic attack (TIA) can have the same symptoms as a stroke.\nAlways manage the patient as if they are having a stroke.\n7. Age-Related Changes in the Nervous System\nSense Age-Related Changes Impact\nVision Decline in acuity, depth\nperception, light accommodation\nIncreased likelihood of falls and\nmedication errors\nHearing Difficulty hearing high\nfrequencies, balance problems\nFalls more likely\nTaste Diminished sense of taste Lessened interest in eating,\nweight loss, malnutrition, fatigue\nTouch Decreased sense of touch and\npain perception\nMay not know if injured\nNormal findings in older people include changes in thinking speed, memory, and\nposture stability . The brain decreases in weight and volume with age, increasing\nspace in the cranium and the risk of head injuries . There is a loss of neurons that\naffects control of breathing, heart rate, blood pressure, hunger, thirst, and body\ntemperature . Performance of most sense organs declines with age .\nVision changes include cataracts, which interfere with vision, making it hard\nto distinguish colors and see clearly. Decreased tear production leads to drier\neyes. Older people may have difficulty differentiating colors and decreased\nnight vision. Presbyopia, the inability to see up close, is caused by less lens\nelasticity. Other diseases affecting vision include glaucoma, macular\ndegeneration, and retinal detachment.\nHearing changes in the inner ear make high-frequency sounds difficult to\nhear. Ear changes can also cause balance problems, increasing fall risk.\nHeredity and noise exposure contribute to hearing loss. Check for hearing aid\nuse during assessment.\nThe sense of taste diminishes due to decreased taste buds, potentially\nleading to less interest in eating, weight loss, malnutrition, and fatigue.\nA decreased sense of touch and pain perception from nerve fiber loss means\nan injured person may not realize it. Decreased sensation of hot and cold also\noccurs.\ndementia is a chronic, generally irreversible condition with slow onset,\nprogressive disorientation, shortened attention span, and loss of cognitive\nfunction. Causes include Alzheimer\u0027s, Parkinson\u0027s, stroke, and genetic factors.\nPatients may show loss of cognitive function, memory problems, decreased\nattention span, decreased communication ability, and confusion.\ndelirium is a sudden change in mental status, consciousness, or cognitive\nprocesses. It is marked by inability to focus, think logically, and maintain\nattention. It affects a significant percentage of hospitalized older adults. It is\nusually caused by reversible physical ailments like fever or metabolic causes.\nLook for histories of intoxication/withdrawal, UTIs, bowel obstruction,\ndehydration, fever, cardiovascular disease, hyperglycemia/hypoglycemia,\ndepression, malnutrition, and environmental emergencies. Assess for hypoxia,\nhypovolemia, hypoglycemia, and hypothermia. Changes in circulation, breath\nsounds, motor function, and pupillary response may be seen.\nSyncope should always be assumed to be an underlying life-threatening\nproblem until proven otherwise. It is often caused by interrupted blood flow to\nthe brain.\nneuropathy is a disorder of the peripheral nervous system nerves, impairing\ntheir function and structure. Symptoms depend on the affected nerves\n(motor, sensory, autonomic) and their location.\n8. Age-Related Changes in the Gastrointestinal and Renal\nSystems\nChanges in the gastrointestinal system affect digestion . Reduced saliva volume\ncauses mouth dryness . Dental loss is widespread, contributing to nutritional and\ndigestive problems . Gastric secretions are reduced . Changes in gastric mobility lead\nto slower emptying . The incidence of certain bowel diseases increases with age .\nBlood flow to the liver declines, decreasing enzyme activity and metabolism . This\naffects how medications impact patients .\nPoor muscular tone of sphincters can lead to regurgitation, heartburn, and\nacid reflux. The rectal sphincter also weakens.\nGI bleeding is common. Causes include inflammation, infection, and\nobstruction. Hematemesis (vomiting blood) is seen with upper GI bleeding.\nmelena (black, tarry stools) usually indicates bleeding in the lower tract. Red\nblood often signifies a local source like hemorrhoids. Patients may experience\nweakness, dizziness, or syncope with GI bleeding. GI bleeding can be lifethreatening.\nSpecific common GI problems include diverticulitis, bleeding in the\nupper/lower GI system, peptic ulcer disease, gallbladder disease, or a bowel\nobstruction. Ask about NSAID and alcohol use. Orthostatic vital signs can help\ndetermine hypovolemia. Treatment includes airway, ventilatory, and\ncirculatory support.\nAcute abdomen complaints in the pre-hospital setting pose the threat of\nblood loss, leading to shock and death. Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a\nrapidly fatal condition.\nAge-related changes in the renal system include reduced function and blood flow .\nKidney weight decreases, leading to a loss of functioning filtering surface . Renal\nblood flow can decrease by 50% . Acute illnesses in older patients often involve\nelectrolyte imbalance due to a markedly decreased thirst mechanism . This can\ncause rapid and severe dehydration .\nIncontinence is not a normal part of aging and can cause skin irritation,\nbreakdown, and UTIs. Bladder capacity decreases with age.\nstress incontinence occurs during activities like coughing, laughing,\nsneezing, lifting, and exercise.\nurge incontinence is triggered by fluids, running water, or thinking about\nthe bathroom.\nUrinary retention, or difficulty urinating, is the opposite of incontinence. An\nenlarged prostate (benign prostate hypertrophy) in men can pressure the\nurethra, making voiding difficult.\nBladder and urinary tract infections can cause inflammation. Severe urinary\nretention can lead to renal failure.\n9. Age-Related Changes in the Endocrine and Immune Systems\nA significant change in older persons is a decrease in metabolism . This affects the\nbody\u0027s metabolism, temperature, growth, and heart rate . Symptoms attributed to\nthis include slower heart rate, fatigue, drier skin/hair, cold intolerance, and weight\ngain . Increased secretion of antidiuretic hormone can cause fluid imbalance .\nHyperglycemia and increased norepinephrine levels may harm the cardiovascular\nsystem .\nHyperosmolar hyperglycemic nonketotic syndrome (hhns) is a diabetic\ncomplication more common in type 2 diabetes. hhns and diabetic\nketoacidosis (DKA) symptoms often overlap. Symptoms include\nhyperglycemia, polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, dizziness, confusion, altered\nmental status, and possibly seizures. Changes in circulation may include\nwarm, flushed skin, poor skin turgor, pale/dry oral mucosa, and a furrowed\ntongue. Patients may show hypotension and shock signs like tachycardia.\nBlood glucose is typically 600 or higher in hhns, while it varies in DKA. DKA\npresents with Kussmaul\u0027s respirations; hhns does not. Treatment includes\nairway, ventilatory, and circulatory support.\nOlder people\u0027s immune systems may be weakened . They may not develop a fever;\nhypothermia can indicate severe systemic infection . Anorexia, fatigue, weight loss,\nfalls, or changes in mental status may be the primary symptom of infection .\nPneumonia and UTIs are common in bedridden patients . When infection occurs,\nsigns and symptoms may be decreased or minimized .\n10. Age-Related Changes in the Musculoskeletal and Skin\nSystems\nCommon Musculoskeletal\nConditions\nDescription\nOsteoporosis Decrease in bone mass and strength, leading to\nfractures\nOsteoarthritis Progressive joint disease destroying cartilage,\nforming bone spurs, causing stiffness\nAging leads to a widespread decrease in bone mass, especially in postmenopausal\nwomen . Bones become more brittle and break more easily . Spinal discs narrow,\ncausing a decrease in height and changes in posture . Joints lose flexibility and may\nbe immobilized by arthritis . Decreased motion and muscle mass result in less\nstrength . Changes in physical abilities can affect confidence in mobility . The muscle\nsystem atrophies and weakens, strength declines . Joint ligaments and cartilage lose\nelasticity, and cartilage degenerates . Stooped posture comes from atrophy of\nsupporting structures and kyphosis (forward curling of the spine) .\nosteoporosis makes patients more susceptible to fractures. Bone loss is\ninfluenced by genetics, smoking, activity level, diet, alcohol consumption,\nhormonal factors, and body weight.\nOsteoarthritis affects joints like hands, knees, hips, and spine. Patients\ncomplain of pain and stiffness that worsens with exertion.\nChanges also occur in the skin . Proteins that make skin pliable decline . The fat layer\nunder the skin becomes thinner . Bruising is more common because skin tears easily .\nSweat glands respond less readily to heat due to atrophy .\nPressure ulcers, or bedsores, develop when pressure cuts off blood flow to\nskin areas. Padding under bony areas and in voids prevents these ulcers.\nUlcers have various stages. They can be painful and cause complications like\nbleeding, sepsis, and bone inflammation.\n11. Toxicology and Polypharmacy in Geriatric Patients\nOlder people are more susceptible to toxicology due to decreased kidney function,\naltered GI absorption, or decreased liver vascular flow . Kidneys undergo many\nchanges with age . Decreased liver function makes it harder to detoxify blood and\neliminate substances like medications and alcohol . Common over-the-counter\nmedications used by older people include aspirin, antacids, cough syrups, and\ndecongestants . These can have negative effects mixed with herbal substances,\nalcohol, or prescriptions .\npolypharmacy refers to the use of multiple prescription medications by one\npatient. Negative effects can include overdosing and negative medication\ninteractions. Medication non-compliance is also an issue due to financial\nchanges, inability to open containers, and impaired cognitive, vision, or\nhearing ability.\n12. Behavioral Emergencies in Older Adults\nDepression is not normal aging but a medical disease affecting millions of older\nAmericans . It is treatable with medication and therapy . Untreated depression is\nassociated with a higher suicide rate in geriatrics . Risk factors include history of\ndepression, chronic disease, and loss . Substance abuse, isolation, prescription\nmedicine use, or chronic medical conditions contribute to depression onset .\nSuicide: Most older adult suicide victims have recently been diagnosed with\ndepression and seen a doctor within a month before the event. Older men\nhave the highest suicide rate in the US. Older persons attempting suicide\nchoose more lethal means and have diminished capacity to survive.\nPredisposing events include death of a loved one, physical illness,\ndepression/hopelessness, alcohol abuse/dependence, or loss of meaningful\nlife roles.\nWhen assessing a patient showing signs of depression, ask if they are\nconsidering suicide. If yes, ask if they have a plan. Include this in your report.\n13. The GEMS Triangle for Assessing Older Patients\nThe GEMS diamond was created to highlight differences in older patients . It is an\nacronym for issues to consider when assessing an older patient .\nG stands for geriatric: Older patients differ from younger ones. Be familiar\nwith normal aging changes and treat with compassion and respect.\nE stands for Environmental Assessment: Assess the environment for clues\nto the patient\u0027s condition and the emergency\u0027s cause. Preventative care is\nvital as older patients may not notice risks.\nM stands for Medical Assessment: Older patients have multiple medical\nproblems and take numerous medications (prescription, OTC, herbal).\nObtaining a thorough medical history is very important.\nS stands for Social Assessment: Older people may have smaller social\nnetworks due to loss of loved ones. They may need help with daily living\nactivities. Consider pamphlets about agencies helping older people.\n14. Special Considerations and Assessment of Geriatric Medical\nPatients\nAssessing geriatric patients has special considerations . These include\ncommunication issues, hearing/visual deficits, and altered consciousness .\nComplicated medical histories and medication effects also affect assessment .\nScene safety: geriatric patients are often in homes, retirement homes, or\nskilled nursing facilities. Access may be hampered if they cannot reach the\ndoor. Note unsafe environmental conditions. Look for clues explaining history\nor current problem. In facilities, find staff to explain the call reason. With\naltered mental status, find someone for history and baseline behavior.\nMechanism of Illness and Injury (NOI): NOI can be difficult to determine with\naltered mental status or dementia. Ask family, caregivers, or bystanders why\nthey called. Multiple chronic diseases complicate NOI determination. Chest\npain, shortness of breath, and altered consciousness are always serious.\nPrimary Assessment: Address life threats and determine transport priority.\nMaintain high suspicion for serious injuries, even with minor mechanisms.\nGeneral Impression: Assess stable or unstable condition as you\napproach. Use AVPU for level of consciousness.\nAirway and Breathing (A\u0026B): Aging and disease can compromise airway\nprotection. Loss of gag reflex and swallowing occurs. Ensure open airway,\nfree from obstruction (dentures, vomit, fluid, blood). Suction may be\nneeded. Anatomic changes affect breathing effectiveness. Loss of\nprotective reflexes decreases ability to clear secretions. Treat airway and\nbreathing issues with oxygen immediately.\nCirculation (C): Poor perfusion is serious. Changes negatively affect\ncirculation. Lower heart rates and weaker/irregular pulses are common.\nVascular changes may make radial pulse hard to feel. Treat circulatory\nproblems with oxygen immediately. Determine if a cardiac abnormality is\nacute or chronic; manage acute emergencies rapidly.\nTransport Decision (D): Complaints compromising airway, breathing, or\ncirculation require priority transport. Determine and treat life-threatening\nconditions; transport priority patients. Older people lack reserves and\ndecompensate quickly. Consider early ALS treatment and immediate\ntransport.\n15. History Taking and Secondary Assessment of Geriatric\nPatients\nFind and account for all medications . Communication can be complicated, but\nthorough history is critical . Determine early if altered consciousness is acute or\nchronic . Multiple diseases and vague complaints complicate assessment .\nTake a full set of vital signs and determine the patient\u0027s normal. The chief\ncomplaint may relate to a chronic condition. Obtain a list of medications and\ntake them to the hospital if possible. Transport to a facility familiar with the\npatient\u0027s history if possible. Last oral intake is important for diabetic patients\nand may indicate dehydration.\nSecondary assessment: Protect patient modesty and keep them warm\nduring the exam.\nVital signs: Medications like beta blockers keep heart rate low, preventing\ntachycardia seen in dehydration/shock. Weak/irregular pulses are common.\nCirculatory compromise makes radial pulse hard to feel; use other pulse\npoints. Blood pressure tends to be higher. Capillary refill is unreliable due to\nskin changes and reduced circulation. Respiratory rate should be normal, but\nchest rise is compromised by stiffness. Pulse oximetry requires adequate\nperfusion for accuracy.\nReassessment: Reassess geriatric patients often as conditions can\ndeteriorate quickly. Recheck interventions, identify and treat changes.\nDocument all history, medication, assessment, and intervention information.\nGuidelines for assessing geriatric patients are available.\n16. Trauma in the Geriatric Population\nIncreased Risks and Complications of\nTrauma\nFactors\nHigher risk of serious injury or death Slower homeostatic compensatory\nmechanism\nComplicated assessment Limited physiologic reserves\nSubtler physical findings Normal aging effects\nLonger healing process Existing medical conditions\nOlder patients have a higher risk of serious injury or death from trauma than younger\npatients . Several conditions increase this risk and complicate assessment . Physical\nfindings may be more subtle and easily missed . The healing process takes longer .\nOlder pedestrians are more likely to have life-threatening complications after being\nstruck by a vehicle . Secondary impacts can cause serious injuries .\nOlder people are more likely to experience burns due to altered mental status,\ninattention, and compromised neurologic status. Mortality from burns\nincreases with pre-existing conditions and a weakened immune system. Fluid\nreplacement is complicated by renal compromise.\nThere is higher mortality from penetrating trauma, especially gunshot\nwounds. Penetrating trauma can easily cause serious internal bleeding.\nFalls are the leading cause of fatal and non-fatal injuries in older adults.\nNearly half of fatal falls result in traumatic brain injuries.\nChanges in pulmonary, cardiovascular, neurologic, and musculoskeletal\nsystems make older patients more susceptible to trauma. Brain shrinkage\nincreases the risk of cerebral bleeding after head trauma. Skeletal changes\nand spinal curvature require extra padding during spinal immobilization. Loss\nof strength, sensory impairment, and medical illness increase fall risk.\nA geriatric patient\u0027s overall physical condition may lessen their ability to\ncompensate for simple injuries.\nosteoporosis predisposes to hip and pelvis fractures; compression fractures\nof the spine are more likely.\nBrain shrinkage makes older patients more likely to sustain closed head\ninjuries like subdural hematomas. Acute subdural hematomas are among the\ndeadliest head injuries. Serious head injuries are often missed because\nmechanisms seem minor. Factors predisposing to serious head injuries\ninclude long-term alcohol abuse, recurrent falls, repeated head injuries, and\nanticoagulation medications.\n17. Environmental Injuries and Trauma Assessment in Older Adults\nChanges in the endocrine system cause delayed internal temperature regulation .\nHeat gain and loss are further delayed by impaired circulation, decreased sweat\nproduction, chronic diseases, medication, and alcohol use . Half of hypothermia\ndeaths occur in older people . Most indoor hypothermia deaths involve geriatric\npatients . Death rates from hyperthermia more than double in older people . People\nover 85 are at the highest risk . Trauma in geriatric patients is rarely isolated to a\nsingle issue .\nTrauma Assessment: Look for clues indicating if a medical incident preceded\nthe trauma. Address life threats and determine transport priority. Transporting\nolder patients to a trauma center is recommended.\nGeneral Impression: Get information from someone familiar with the\npatient if possible. Use AVPU and GCS for mental status.\nAirway: Diminished cough ability makes suctioning important. Assess for\ndentures but don\u0027t remove unless they obstruct the airway.\nCirculation: Alcohol and anticoagulants worsen internal/external bleeding.\nOlder patients can go into shock more easily. Hypertensive patients may\nhave normal blood pressure while in shock.\nInvestigate the chief complaint and consider past medical conditions.\nSecondary Assessment: Perform physical exams like on younger adults, but\nconsider damage likelihood. Head injuries are life-threatening. Examine the\nchest, considering impaired breathing. Look for bruising and trauma evidence.\nAssess pulse, blood pressure, and vital signs. Capillary refill is unreliable due\nto compromised circulation. Beta blockers inhibit tachycardia expected in\nshock. Repeat the primary assessment. geriatric patients are more likely to\ndecompensate after trauma.\nBroken bones are common and should be splinted. Do not force kyphosis into\nnormal position. Provide blankets and heat to prevent hypothermia. Provide\npsychological support along with medical treatment. Document assessment,\ntreatment, and reassessment, including status changes.\n18. Responding to Calls in Nursing and Skilled Facilities\nCalls at nursing homes or skilled facilities can be challenging . Patients often have\naltered consciousness and cannot provide NOI or mechanism of injury . The most\nimportant information is what is wrong and what is different today that prompted the\ncall . Talk to the staff who care for the patient daily .\nInfection control is a high priority.\nMRSA infections are common in close quarters like nursing homes. It can\nbe found in ulcers, feeding tubes, and catheters. Protect yourself and\nreduce spread by washing hands before and after every patient contact.\nProperly dispose of or disinfect equipment and use standard precautions.\nVRE is a cause of hospital-acquired infections.\nRSV infects upper and lower respiratory tracts. It is highly contagious and\nfound in nasal/throat discharges. Wear appropriate PPE and\ndecontaminate the ambulance/equipment.\nC. diff causes hospital-acquired infectious diarrhea. Healthcare workers\ncan carry it after contact with contaminated feces. Alcohol-based hand\nsanitizers do not kill C. diff. Contact precautions with gowns, gloves, and\nhand-washing with soap and water are essential to prevent transmission.\nSARS-CoV-2 causes COVID-19, a respiratory illness affecting vulnerable\nolder people, especially with pre-existing conditions. It spreads through\nairborne droplets.\n19. Caring for Dying Patients and Advanced Directives\nMore terminally ill older patients are choosing to die at home . Dying patients receive\npalliative or comfort care . This focuses on relieving pain and providing emotional\nsupport for the patient and loved ones . Your interaction with a dying patient impacts\nthe family long-term; be understanding, sensitive, and compassionate .\nAdvanced directives are legal papers guiding relatives/caregivers about\nmedical treatment for patients unable to speak for themselves.\nA Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) order gives permission not to attempt\nresuscitation from cardiac arrest. A valid DNR must be signed by the\npatient/surrogate and a physician/healthcare provider.\nA DNR does not mean \"do not treat\". If the patient is alive, provide\nsupportive measures like oxygen, pain relief, and comfort.\nA healthcare power of attorney is an advanced directive where an\nauthorized person makes medical decisions for the patient.\nA POLST (Physician Orders for Sustaining Treatment) provides medical\norders in addition to advanced directives. Orders may be specific to\npatients with life-threatening conditions or frail health.\nIf there is any question about orders or no written orders, initiate\nresuscitation.\n20. Elder Abuse and Neglect\nElder abuse is any action by a person that takes advantage of an older person\u0027s\nproperty or emotional state . Abuse can be acts of commission (words/actions\ncausing harm, like verbal, physical, sexual assault) . Abuse can also be acts of\nomission (failure to act, like denying nutrition or medical care) .\nElder abuse is often hidden. Definitions of abuse/neglect vary. Victims are\nhesitant to report due to feeling traumatized or fearing punishment.\nAbused persons are often frail with chronic medical conditions or dementia.\nAbuse most often occurs in women older than 75.\nAbusers may be products of child abuse themselves, with abuse being\nretaliatory. Most abusers are not trained in older person care. Environments\nlike nursing homes are sites where older people sustain harm (physical,\nphysiological, financial, pharmacological).\nBe suspicious of abuse if answers about injuries are concealed or avoided, or\nif answers are unbelievable.\nInformation suggesting abuse includes caregiver apathy or defensiveness,\ncaregiver not allowing patient to answer, repeated ER visits, history of being\naccident prone, unbelievable/vague/inconsistent injury explanations. Other\nsigns include chronic pain without explanation, self-destructive behavior,\neating/sleep disorders, depression, lack of energy, and substance/sexual\nabuse history. Many abused patients make false statements due to fear of\nretribution.\nSigns of physical abuse include bruises on buttocks/lower back, genitals/inner\nthighs, cheeks/ear lobes, neck, upper lip, or inside the mouth. Pressure\nbruises from a hand may be oval grab marks, pinch marks, or hand prints.\nHuman bites are typically on upper extremities and can cause\nlacerations/infections. Inspect earlobes for signs of twisting, pulling, or\npinching. Investigate multiple bruises in various stages or signs of being\nundernourished.\nTypical abuse burns are caused by cigarettes, matches, heated metal, forced\nimmersion in hot liquids, chemicals, and electrical sources.\nCheck for signs of neglect like lack of hygiene, poor dental hygiene, poor\ntemperature regulation, or lack of reasonable home amenities.

Introduction to Special Challenges in Emergency Care\nThis report discusses patients with special challenges in emergency care.\nIt covers the needs of patients with developmental, sensory, and physical\ndisabilities.\nUnderstanding the unique anatomy and physiology of these patients is\ncrucial.\nSpecial care is also needed for patients relying on medical technology.\nEven with medical equipment, the focus must remain on the patient.\nFollow the ABCs (Airway, Breathing, Circulation) as a core principle.\nPatient Group Key Characteristics\nDevelopmental Disabilities May impair physical ability, learning, language, or\nbehavioral skills\nSensory Disabilities Affect vision or hearing\nPhysical Disabilities Affect body movement and physical function\nMedical Technology\nAssistance\nRely on devices for breathing, eating, urination, or\nbowel function\nBariatric Patients Have excessive body fat\n2. Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities\nIntellectual disability is a subset of developmental disability.\nIt involves limitations in intellectual functioning and daily living skills.\nDiagnosis is made before age 18.\nPossible causes include genetic factors, birth complications, or\nenvironmental factors.\nAutism spectrum disorder is characterized by deficiencies in social\ncommunication and repetitive behaviors.\nPatients may have abnormal sensory responses.\nThey might laugh or hum in response to pain.\nSensitivity to noise or physical stimulation can be increased.\nKeep the environment calm and minimize stimulation.\nUse short, direct, and simple phrases.\nAllow extra time for processing communication.\nDemonstrating techniques on a trusted individual can help.\nDown syndrome is a genetic chromosomal defect.\nIt results in mild to severe intellectual impairment.\nIncreased maternal age is a risk factor.\nPhysical abnormalities include a round head, flat occiput, and large\nprotruding tongue.\nThey have an increased risk for medical complications like heart defects\nand leukemia.\nIntubation can be difficult due to large tongues and small cavities.\nThe jaw thrust maneuver or nasopharyngeal airway may be needed.\nApproximately 15 percent have instability in the upper spine.\nThis places them at increased risk with trauma.\nApproach calmly and friendly.\nIntroduce team members and explain procedures.\nMove slowly and deliberately.\nMake sure you are at eye level.\nCondition Characteristics Care Considerations\nIntellectual\nD.\nLimitations in intellect and\ndaily living skills\nRely on patients/family for info;\nsusceptible to same diseases\nAutism Deficiencies in social\ncommunication; repetitive\nbehaviors; abnormal sensory\nR.\nKeep environment calm; minimize\nstimulation; use simple phrases;\nallow time\nDown\nSyndrome\nMild to severe intellectual\nimpairment; physical\nabnormalities; increased risks\nApproach calmly; introduce team;\nexplain actions;\nintubation/ventilation challenges\n3. Sensory and Physical Disabilities\nSensory disabilities affect vision or hearing.\nVisual impairment can range from partial to total.\nCauses include congenital disease, injury, or nerve degeneration.\nLook for signs like a cane or service animal.\nMake yourself known upon entering a room.\nIntroduce yourself and your team.\nRetrieve and provide visual aids.\nTell the patient what is happening and identify noises.\nDescribe the situation and surroundings.\nAmbulatory patients can be led by a light touch or by resting their hand on\nyour shoulder.\nAsk the patient their preferred method.\nGently guide, never pull or push.\nCommunicate obstacles in advance.\nTake canes or walkers with you during transport.\nService animals can remain with the patient.\nHearing impairment ranges from slight to total deafness.\nCauses include nerve damage or faulty transmission.\nClues include hearing aids or failure to respond.\nAssist with hearing aids if needed.\nFace the patient to allow lip reading.\nDo not exaggerate lip movements or look away.\nPosition yourself about 18 inches in front.\nDo not speak louder, try lowering your pitch.\nConsider American Sign Language, paper, or pencil.\nOnly one person should ask questions.\nPhysical disabilities include conditions like cerebral palsy and spina bifida.\nCerebral palsy is due to damage to the developing brain.\nIt causes poorly controlled body movement.\nSymptoms range from mild to severe.\nObserve the airway closely.\nDo not assume intellectual disability.\nLimbs may be underdeveloped and prone to injury.\nUnsteady gait is common, leading to falls.\nPad the patient for comfort.\nNever force extremities into positions.\nTake walkers and wheelchairs during transport.\nBe prepared for seizures and keep suctioning ready.\nSpina bifida is a birth defect with incomplete spinal column closure.\nThis often leaves spinal and neurologic damage.\nAssociated conditions include hydrocephalus and paralysis of lower\nextremities.\nAsk caregivers the best way to move the patient.\nParalysis is the inability to move one or more body parts voluntarily.\nPossible causes include stroke, trauma, or birth defect.\nSensation can be normal or increased.\nFacial paralysis can cause communication challenges.\nThe diaphragm may need ventilator assistance.\nPatients may have specialized equipment like catheters or feeding tubes.\nDifficulty swallowing may require suctioning.\nAsk caregivers the best way to move these patients.\nDisability\nType\nCommunication Strategies Transport Considerations\nVisual\nImpairment\nMake yourself known;\nintroduce team; describe\nsurroundings; identify noises\nTake cane/walker; service animal\nmay remain; gentle guidance;\ncommunicate obstacles\nHearing\nImpairment\nAssist with hearing aids; face\npatient; lower pitch; sign\nlanguage/writing\nN/A\nCerebral\nPalsy\nN/A Observe airway; pad for comfort;\ndo not force extremities; take\nwalkers/wheelchairs\nSpina Bifida Ask patient/caregivers best\nway to move\nAsk patient/caregivers best way\nto move\nParalysis Facial paralysis may cause\nchallenges; suctioning may be\nneeded\nAsk parents/caregivers best way\nto move\n4. Care for Bariatric Patients\nObesity is a condition with excessive body fat.\nIt results from an imbalance between calories consumed and used.\nObesity is defined as being 30% or more over ideal body weight.\nSevere obesity is two to three times over ideal body weight.\nObesity can negatively affect quality of life.\nAssociated health problems include mobility difficulties, diabetes, high\nblood pressure, heart disease, and stroke.\nPatients may feel embarrassed about their condition.\nPlan early for extra help or specialized equipment if transport is needed.\nFind the easiest and safest exit route.\nThere is a risk of dropping the patient or injuring team members.\nTreat the patient with dignity and respect at all times.\nAsk the patient the best way to move them.\nAvoid lifting with only one limb to prevent injury.\nCoordination and communication are crucial during lifting.\nDiscuss all moves prior to lifting.\nThis prevents soft tissue injury or deep vein thrombosis.\nLook for pinch and pressure points from equipment.\nBecome familiar with specialized equipment and resources.\nLarge patients may have difficulty breathing in a supine position.\nPlan egress routes to accommodate large patients, equipment, and crew.\nNotify the receiving hospital early.\n5. Patients Reliant on Medical Technology\nMany patients with chronic diseases live at home with medical devices.\nTracheostomy tubes provide an airway between the neck and trachea.\nThey can be temporary or permanent.\nSecretions can build up around the tube.\nTubes are prone to obstruction by mucus or foreign bodies.\nThe DOPE mnemonic helps recognize obstruction causes.\nD stands for Displacement, Dislodged, or Damaged tube.\nO stands for Obstruction (blood, secretions, vomit).\nP is for Pneumothorax.\nE is for Equipment failure (kinking, ventilator issue, empty O2).\nCommon problems include bleeding, air leaking, or infection.\nSuction the patient in a comfortable position.\nInsert the suction catheter no more than 1-2 inches.\nDo not suction for more than 10 minutes.\nDo not force the catheter.\nOxygenate before and after suctioning.\nCall for advanced life support.\nHome oxygen can be delivered by gas cylinders or concentrators.\nGas cylinders are heavy and bulky but don\u0027t need electricity.\nConcentrators take ambient air and provide almost 100% oxygen.\nConcentrators need electricity and usually supply 1-3 liters.\nPatients must have a backup plan for power failure.\nAsk why they are on oxygen and their baseline requirements.\nMechanical ventilators are used when patients cannot breathe on their own.\nCauses include lung disease, brain injury, or muscular dystrophy.\nIf the ventilator malfunctions, remove the patient.\nApply a tracheostomy collar or face mask over the stoma.\nCaregivers will know how the ventilator works.\nApnea monitors are used for infants to monitor heart and respiratory rate.\nThey sound an alarm if rates are low.\nThey attach with electrodes to a belt.\nThey provide a pulse ox reading.\nBring the monitor to the receiving facility if possible.\nInternal cardiac pacemakers regulate the heart.\nSome include an AED function.\nNever place D-fib or pacing pads over the device.\nGather history about the pacemaker.\nPatients may have an identification card.\nLeft Ventricular Assist Devices (LVADs) take over heart ventricle function.\nThey bridge to transplant or are a permanent solution.\nIt may be difficult to palpate a pulse with an LVAD.\nAssess perfusion by level of consciousness, skin, and blood pressure.\nRisks include bleeding, infection, blood clots, or heart failure.\nCall the patient support team and contact medical control.\nCheck connections and batteries if the alarm sounds.\nNotify advanced life support.\nAn external defibrillator device is a vest with monitoring and pads.\nIt provides alerts and prompts before delivering a shock.\nLeave the vest in place during CPR unless it interferes.\nTransport any patient who has received a shock.\nCentral venous catheters provide venous access via the vena cava.\nThey are used for chemotherapy, antibiotics, nutrition, or dialysis.\nCommon problems include broken lines, infection, or bleeding.\nA gastrostomy tube (G-tube) is placed into the stomach for feeding.\nIt can be inserted through the nose/mouth or surgically through the\nabdominal wall.\nIt may become dislodged.\nImmediately stop fluid flow if dislodged.\nAssess for signs of bleeding in the stomach.\nPatients are at increased risk of aspiration.\nHave suctioning readily available.\nTransport patients with difficulty breathing while sitting or on their right\nside with head elevated.\nDiabetic patients with G-tubes may become hypoglycemic.\nContinue the feeding tube and transport the pump unless it\u0027s\ndysfunctional.\nMedical\nTechnology\nPurpose Common Problems\nTracheostomy\nTube\nProvides airway Obstruction (mucus, foreign\nbodies); bleeding; air leaking;\ninfection\nHome Oxygen Provides oxygen via\ncylinder or concentrator\nCylinders heavy/bulky;\nconcentrators need electricity;\nsupply runs out\nMechanical\nVentilator\nAssists breathing Malfunction\nApnea Monitor Monitors infant\nheart/respiratory rate\nAlarm sounds for low rates\nInternal Cardiac\nPacemaker\nRegulates heart rhythm Pads should not be placed over\ndevice\nLVAD Takes over heart ventricle\nfunction\nBleeding; infection; blood clots;\nacute heart failure; pulse difficult\nto palpate\nExternal\nDefibrillator\nVest with monitoring and\npads for shock delivery\nCan interfere with CPR; patient\nneeds transport after shock\nCentral Venous\nCatheter\nProvides venous access Broken/clotted lines; infection;\nbleeding\nGastrostomy\nTube (G-tube)\nProvides stomach access\nfor feeding\nDislodgement; bleeding;\naspiration risk\n6. Other Special Situations and Considerations\nShunts drain excess cerebral fluid from the brain.\nThey keep pressure from building up.\nTypes include ventricular peritoneum or ventricular atrium shunts.\nA device beneath the skin may be felt.\nShunts can become blocked or infected.\nInfections may occur soon after insertion.\nSigns of problems include high-pitched crying (infants), headache,\nvomiting, altered mental status, irritability, or fever.\nDifficulty with coordination, blurred vision, seizures, redness along the\nshunt, or bradycardia may occur.\nVagal nerve stimulators treat seizures not controlled by medication.\nThey stimulate the vagal nerve at intervals.\nThey are used with medications to reduce seizure frequency.\nThey are located under the skin.\nOstomies (colostomy, ileostomy, urostomy) are surgical openings.\nThey allow waste elimination into external bags.\nAssess for signs of dehydration with diarrhea or vomiting.\nThe area around the stoma is prone to infection.\nSigns of infection include warmth, redness, or tenderness.\nContact medical control or follow protocols for care.\nHome care patients receive services in their home.\nThis includes infants, older adults, and those with chronic illnesses.\nServices range from meals and cleaning to personal care and wound care.\nObtain status and history from the home healthcare provider.\nHospice care is for terminally ill patients.\nIt provides comfort (palliative) care.\nMost hospice patients have do not resuscitate (DNR) orders.\nFollow local protocols and legal documents like DNRs.\nCare at home impacts the family; show compassion and sensitivity.\nAscertain the family\u0027s wishes about remaining home or transport.\nFollow protocols for handling death.\nPoverty and homelessness present special challenges.\nIndividuals may lack basic needs like housing, food, and healthcare.\nLack of disease prevention leads to increased probability of illness.\nThe homeless population includes those with mental illness, brain trauma,\nvictims of abuse, and those with addiction.\nProvide emergency care and transport to the appropriate facility.\nAll healthcare facilities must provide assessment and treatment regardless\nof ability to pay.\nBecome familiar with community social services resources.\n7. Conclusion\nThis lecture covered patients with special challenges.\nUnderstanding the unique needs of these patients is vital.\nThe focus should always be on the patient, following the ABCs.\nKnowledge of intellectual, developmental, sensory, and physical disabilities is\nimportant.\nCare for bariatric patients requires planning and dignity.\nPatients with medical technology need specific care and troubleshooting.\nSituations like shunts, vagal nerve stimulators, ostomies, home care, hospice,\npoverty, and homelessness require informed care.\nInteracting with caregivers is an important part of assessment.\nCompassion, understanding, and sensitivity are crucial in all interactions.\nThis report summarizes key considerations for patients with special\nchallenges.\n",

Introduction to Emergency Medical Transport\nAn ambulance is a vehicle used for treating and transporting patients who\nneed emergency care to the hospital.\nEmergency medical transport aims to provide effective preparation for\ntransport.\nIt also focuses on safe emergency vehicle operations.\nAppropriate transport decisions are covered.\nSafe patient transfer techniques are a key part.\nA responsible approach to patient care during transport is emphasized.\nEMTs play a vital role in each phase of an ambulance call.\n2. Ambulance Design and Equipment\nType of Design Description\nType 1 Basic ambulance design\nType 2 Basic ambulance design\nType 3 Basic ambulance design\nModern ambulances are designed based on nfpa 1917, the standard for\nautomotive ambulances.\nDesigns incorporate suggestions from the ambulance industry and EMS\npersonnel.\nComponents include a driver\u0027s compartment.\nThere is a patient\u0027s compartment large enough for two EMTs and at least one\nsupine patient.\nAdditional patients can be seated on the bench or swivel seat with safety\nrestraints.\nEquipment and supplies are needed for emergency medical care at the scene\nand during transport.\nSupplies also safeguard personnel and patients from hazardous\nconditions.\nThey also carry out light extrication procedures.\nA two-way radio is included for communication.\nEquipment and supplies should be durable and standardized.\nThey are stored according to how urgently and often they are used.\nItems for life-threatening conditions are placed within easy reach.\nItems for cardiac arrest, bleeding, and blood pressure are placed at the\nsides of the stretcher.\nCabinets and drawers should have transparent fronts and be labeled.\nThey should open easily and close securely.\nMedical equipment includes basic supplies, PPE, sharps containers, airway\nand ventilation equipment, wound supplies, splinting, childbirth supplies, AED,\npatient transfer equipment, medications, and communications.\nAirway and ventilation equipment includes OPAs and NPAs for different ages,\nCPAP equipment, and advanced airway equipment.\nPortable artificial ventilators that operate independently of oxygen are\nneeded.\nBag valve masks, non-rebreathers, nebulizer masks, and suction units are\nincluded.\nAt least two types of oxygen supply units, portable and installed, are\nrequired.\nCPR equipment includes a CPR board and potentially a mechanical device for\nchest compressions.\nPatient transfer equipment includes stretchers, stair chairs, backboards, and\nimmobilization devices.\nA jump kit is a five-minute kit with everything needed within the first five\nminutes, except the AED.\nSafety equipment includes warning devices, fire extinguishers, hard hats,\nfloodlights, and flashlights.\nNavigational aids like GPS and MDTs are used.\nDetailed street maps should also be kept as backup.\nextrication equipment is kept in an outside compartment for simple light\nextrication.\nAt least one EMT should be in the patient compartment during transport.\n3. The Nine Phases of an Ambulance Call: Preparation and\nDispatch\nAn ambulance call has nine different phases.\nThe first phase is preparation.\nIn the preparation phase, all equipment and supplies are checked and made\nready.\nNew equipment is placed only after proper instruction and medical director\nconsultation.\nEquipment should be durable and standardized.\nDaily inspections are part of the preparation phase.\nInspections include checking fuel, oil, transmission fluid, engine cooling,\nbatteries, and brake fluid.\nWheels, tires, interior, and exterior lights are checked.\nWindshield wiper fluid, horn, siren, and air conditioner are checked.\nCommunication systems must work.\nWindows and mirrors must be clean.\nMedical and safety equipment is inspected for cleanliness, quality, and\nfunction.\nStandard traffic safety rules are reviewed.\nSafety devices like seat belts must be working properly.\nOxygen tanks and all equipment must be secured appropriately.\nThe second phase is dispatch.\nDispatch must be accessible 24 hours a day.\nThe dispatcher gathers information about the call.\nThis includes the nature of the call, the caller\u0027s name, location, and\ncallback number.\nThe exact location, number of patients, severity of conditions, and other\npertinent information are gathered.\n4. The Nine Phases of an Ambulance Call: En Route and Arrival at\nthe Scene\nThe third phase is en route.\nThe en route phase to the scene is often the most dangerous.\nCrashes cause many serious injuries.\nAlways fasten seat belts and shoulder harnesses before moving the\nambulance.\nReview dispatcher information and prepare to assess and care for the patient.\nAssign specific duties and scene management tasks.\nDecide which equipment to take to the patient.\nThe fourth phase is arrival at the scene.\nIf first on scene, perform a scene size-up and report findings to dispatch.\nLook for safety hazards for all personnel, bystanders, and the patient.\nEvaluate the need for additional units or assistance.\nDetermine the mechanism of injury or nature of illness.\nEvaluate the need for spinal precautions.\nFollow standard precautions for mass casualty incidents.\nEstimate and communicate the number of patients to the incident\ncommander.\nPark safely at the scene.\nChoose a position that allows efficient traffic flow.\nPark 100 feet before or past a crash to create a barrier.\nDo not park alongside the scene as it may block other vehicles.\nPark uphill and upwind of smoke or hazardous materials.\nLeave warning lights or devices on.\nKeep a safe distance from operations at the scene.\nStay away from fires, hazards, downed wires, and unstable structures.\nSet the parking brake.\nPark as close as possible to facilitate care and transport.\nIf blocking traffic is necessary, do so quickly and safely.\nTraffic control is for orderly flow, warning other drivers, and preventing\nanother crash.\nPlace warning devices like reflectors on both sides of a crash as soon as\npossible.\n5. The Nine Phases of an Ambulance Call: Patient Transfer and\nTransport\nThe fifth phase is the transfer of the patient.\nThe patient must be prepared for transport.\nThis includes securing the patient to a backboard, scoop stretcher, or\nwheeled ambulance stretcher.\nProperly lift the patient into the patient compartment.\nSecure the patient with at least three body straps.\nUse deceleration or stopping straps over the patient\u0027s shoulders.\nThis is especially important if the patient is lying flat or on a backboard.\nThe sixth phase is en route to the receiving facility, also called transport.\nProvide dispatch with information when ready to leave.\nThis includes the number of patients and the destination.\nBeginning mileage may also be reported in some jurisdictions.\nMonitor the patient en route.\nRecheck stable patients every 15 minutes.\nRecheck unstable patients every 5 minutes.\nContact the receiving facility to inform them of arrival.\nDo not abandon the patient emotionally.\nBe aware of the patient\u0027s level of need.\nUse common sense and defensive driving techniques.\n6. The Nine Phases of an Ambulance Call: Delivery, En Route to\nStation, and Post-Run\nThe seventh phase is arrival at the receiving facility and patient delivery.\nInform dispatch as soon as you arrive at the hospital.\nReport your arrival to the triage nurse or other arriving personnel.\nPhysically transfer the patient.\nPresent a complete verbal report.\nComplete a detailed patient report.\nThe eighth phase is en route to the station.\nRestock items used during the call if not done at the hospital.\nInform dispatch of your status and location.\nThe ninth phase is post-run.\nClean and disinfect the ambulance and equipment if not done at the hospital.\nRestock supplies if not done at the hospital.\nThe post-run phase includes completing and filing any additional reports.\nInform dispatch of your status, location, and availability.\nThis is the appropriate time for debriefing following the call.\nRoutine ambulance inspections can be performed.\nRefuel the vehicle.\ncleaning removes dust, dirt, blood, or visible contaminants.\nDisinfecting kills pathogenic agents with chemical.\nHigh-level disinfection uses potent means to kill pathogens.\nSterilization removes microbial contamination, often using heat.\nAfter each call, strip used linens and place them in plastic bags.\nDiscard medical waste in appropriate receptacles.\nWash contaminated areas with soap and water.\nDisinfect all non-disposable equipment used.\nClean the stretcher and spillage with an EPA-registered solution or\nbleach/water mix.\n7. Safe Emergency Vehicle Operations: Driver Characteristics and\nPractices\nCertain driver characteristics are needed to operate an emergency vehicle.\nPhysical fitness and alertness are necessary.\nDrivers should not be driving if taking medications that cause drowsiness or\nslow reaction time.\nDriving under the influence of alcohol is prohibited.\nDriving after long or multiple consecutive shifts should be avoided.\nNotify your employer if you feel unable to safely operate the vehicle due to a\nprevious shift.\nEmotional maturity and stability are necessary to operate under stress.\nDrivers cannot drive based on personal preference just because lights and\nsirens are on.\nThe vehicle must be operated with due regard for safety of others and\npreservation of property.\nSafe driving practices are essential.\nAll drivers and passengers must wear seatbelts and shoulder restraints.\nIf removed for care, fasten the seatbelt again as soon as possible.\nUnrestrained patients and equipment can become airborne during a collision.\nBecome familiar with how your vehicle accelerates, corners, sways, and\nstops.\nOn a multi-lane highway, stay in the extreme left or fast lane.\nThis allows other motorists to move right when they see or hear you.\n8. Safe Emergency Vehicle Operations: Siren Use, Anticipation,\nand Blind Spots\nThe decision to use emergency lights and sirens depends on several factors.\nThese include local protocols and patient conditions.\nThe anticipated clinical outcome of the patient is considered.\nConsider the patient\u0027s condition before activating lights and sirens as they\nmay increase anxiety.\nDriver anticipation is crucial.\nAlways assume motorists have not heard or seen you until proven otherwise.\nLook at the direction of other vehicles\u0027 front tires for early indication of their\nturn.\nAlways drive defensively.\nMaintain a cushion of safety by keeping a safe following distance.\nAvoid being tailgated from behind.\nEnsure blind spots in mirrors do not prevent seeing other vehicles or\npedestrians.\nTo distance yourself from a tailgater, slow down or contact police.\nNever get out of the ambulance to confront a driver.\nThere are three blind spots around the ambulance.\nThe rearview mirror creates a blind spot in front of the driver.\nThe rear of the vehicle cannot be fully seen through the mirror.\nThere are blind spots on the sides of the vehicle.\nScan mirrors frequently for hazards.\nUse a spotter and predetermined hand signals when backing up.\n9. Safe Emergency Vehicle Operations: Speed, Vehicle Size, and\nRoad Conditions\nExcessive speed is unnecessary, dangerous, and does not increase patient\nsurvival chances.\nIt makes providing care in the back difficult.\nExcessive speed hinders the driver\u0027s reaction time.\nIt increases the time and distance needed to stop.\nsiren syndrome may cause drivers to drive faster due to anxiety.\nA siren requests drivers to yield, but they do not always do this.\nVehicle size and distance are critical for maneuvering, driving, and parking.\nPreventable accidents often happen when backing up.\nAlways use a ground guide outside the ambulance when backing.\nVehicle size and weight greatly influence braking and stopping distances.\nRoad positioning refers to the vehicle\u0027s position on the roadway.\nTo keep the ambulance in the proper lane when cornering, enter high on the\noutside and exit low to the inside.\nAmbulances have a longer braking time and stopping distance.\nThe uneven weight distribution makes ambulances prone to roll over.\nBe alert to changing weather and road conditions.\nhydroplaning can occur at speeds greater than 30 mph when tires lift off the\nroad on water.\nIf hydroplaning occurs, gradually slow down without jamming the brakes.\nWet brakes do not slow as efficiently and may cause the vehicle to pull.\nAvoid driving through large puddles or moving water.\nDecrease visibility in fog, smoke, snow, or heavy rain requires slowing down to\na safe speed.\nAlways use headlights and watch for stopped or slow-moving vehicles.\nOn icy or slippery surfaces, good all-weather tires and appropriate speed\nreduce traction problems.\nConsider using snow tires or chains if permitted by law.\n10. Safe Emergency Vehicle Operations: Laws, Regulations, and\nHazards\nEmergency vehicle drivers are exempt from some normal regulations during a\ncall.\nHowever, certain laws and regulations must be followed.\nMotor vehicle crashes are a large source of lawsuits against EMS personnel\nand services.\nWhen on an emergency call with warning lights and sirens, certain actions\nmay be allowed.\nThese include parking in an otherwise illegal location.\nProceeding through a red light or stop sign is allowed, but never without\nstopping first.\nDriving faster than the posted speed limit may be permitted.\nDriving against traffic on a one-way street or making an illegal turn might\nbe allowed.\nTraveling left of center for an otherwise illegal pass is possible.\nAn emergency vehicle is never allowed to pass a school bus stopped with\nflashing red lights.\nWarning lights and sirens are governed by three principles.\nThe call must be a true emergency.\nAudible and visible warning devices must be used simultaneously.\nThe unit must be operated with due regard for the safety of others.\nState statutes often grant emergency vehicles the right-of-way to disregard\nrules.\nHowever, the operator must not endanger other people or property under\nany circumstances.\nKnow your local right-of-way privileges and exercise them only when\nnecessary for the patient\u0027s well-being.\nPolice escorts should be used only on unfamiliar territory.\nDifferent tones should be used for warning lights or sirens.\nIf being guided, follow at a safe distance.\nIntersection crashes are the most common and serious type involving\nambulances.\nAlways be alert when approaching intersections.\nIf on an urgent call and unable to wait for the light, come to a complete stop.\nCheck for other motorists and pedestrians before proceeding.\nOn highways, shut down lights and sirens until reaching the far left lane.\nUse the same procedure when exiting as when entering the highway.\nOn paved roads, operate at a lower speed and maintain a firm grip on the\nsteering wheel.\nIt is unlawful to exceed the speed limit in school zones, regardless of patient\ncondition.\n11. Safe Emergency Vehicle Operations: Distractions and Fatigue\nWhen the ambulance is in motion, focus entirely on driving and anticipating\nroadway hazards.\nMinimize distractions from mobile dispatch terminals.\nMinimize distractions from mounted radios, stereos, cell phones, or\neating/drinking.\nWhen driving alone, focus on figuring out the safest route and mentally\npreparing for the call.\nThese situations demand complete attention and focus.\nUnderstand that fatigue is a risk.\nRecognize when you are fatigued and alert your partner or supervisor.\nYou should be placed out of service until the fatigue has passed.\nYou must be capable of operating the vehicle safely before returning to\nservice.\n12. Air Medical Operations: Types of Air Ambulances and\nMedevac Criteria\nAir medical operations use air ambulances to evacuate medical and trauma\npatients.\nThere are two different kinds of air ambulances.\nFixed wing units are used for interfacility transfers over greater distances,\nlike 200 to 250 miles.\nrotary wing units, which are helicopters, are efficient for shorter distances.\nSpecially trained crews accompany air ambulance flights.\nEMT duties are limited to providing ground support.\nMedical evacuation (medevac) is performed exclusively by helicopters.\nCapabilities, protocols, and procedures vary between EMS systems.\nReasons for calling a medevac include:\nTransport time to the hospital by ground is too long.\nRoad traffic or environmental conditions prohibit ground ambulance use.\nThe patient requires advanced care beyond the EMT\u0027s capabilities.\nMultiple patients may overwhelm hospital resources reachable by ground.\nPatients who may receive a medevac include those with time-dependent\ninjuries or illnesses.\nPatients suspected of stroke, heart attack, or spinal injury are candidates.\nPatients found in remote areas may receive a medevac.\nTrauma patients and candidates for limb replantation are included.\nPatients needing a burn center, hyperbaric chamber, or venomous bite\ncenter may receive a medevac.\nGenerally, the dispatcher should be notified first when calling for a medevac.\nIn some regions, EMS can communicate with the flight crew after initiating the\nrequest.\n13. Air Medical Operations: Establishing a Landing Zone and\nSafety\nEstablishing a landing zone is crucial for air medical operations.\nThe safest and most effective way to land and take off is similar to fixed-wing\naircraft.\nLanding at a slight angle allows for safer operations.\nEstablishing the landing zone is the responsibility of the ground EMS crew.\nAn appropriate site should be a hard or grassy level surface.\nThe recommended size is 100 by 100 feet, but no less than 60 by 60 feet.\nClear all loose debris from the landing zone.\nThe area should be cleared of overhead or tall hazards.\nMark the landing site using weighted cones.\nAn emergency vehicle can be positioned at a corner with headlights facing\ninward to form an X.\nNever use caution tape or ask people to mark the spot.\nDo not use flares.\nMove non-essential persons and vehicles to a safe distance outside the\nlanding zone.\nCommunicate the direction of strong wind to the flight crew.\nFor landing zone safety, stay away from the helicopter unless directed by the\npilot or crew.\nKeep a safe distance from the aircraft when it is on the ground or \"hot\"\n(blades spinning).\nStay outside the landing zone perimeter unless directed to enter.\nIf asked to enter, stay away from the tail rotor as the tips are invisible.\nAlways approach the helicopter from the front.\nApproach only after the pilot or flight crew member signals it is clear.\nEnter only in the area between 10 o\u0027clock and 2 o\u0027clock.\nNever duck under the body, tail, or rear section of the helicopter.\nWalk in a crouched position when approaching the aircraft.\nBe familiar with your jurisdiction\u0027s helicopter hand signals.\nMake certain all patient care equipment and the patient are properly secured.\nSome helicopters load patients from the side, while others have rear loading\ndoors.\nSmoking and open flames are not permitted within 50 feet of the aircraft.\nWear eye protection at all times.\n14. Air Medical Operations: Special Considerations and Issues\nThere are special considerations for helicopter operations.\nFor night landings, do not shine spotlights or flashlights into the air as they\nmay temporarily blind the pilot.\nDirect low-intensity headlights or lanterns towards the ground at the landing\nsite.\nIlluminate overhead hazards or obstructions if possible.\nIf landing on uneven ground, use extra caution.\nThe main rotor blade will be closer to the ground on the uphill side.\nApproach the aircraft from the downhill side only, or as directed by the flight\ncrew.\nFor a medevac at a hazmat incident, immediately notify the flight crew of the\npresence of hazardous material.\nConsult the flight crew and incident commander about the best approach and\ndistance for the medevac.\nThe landing zone should be uphill and upwind from the hazmat scene.\nProperly decontaminate patients before loading them into the helicopter.\nSeveral factors influence the decision to request a medevac.\nThese include access and the severity of the weather.\nMost helicopter services are limited to flying below 10,000 feet above sea\nlevel.\nmedevac helicopters fly between 130 to 150 miles per hour.\nDue to the confined space in the cabin, assess the number and size of\npatients that can be safely transported.\nmedevac flights are extremely expensive compared to ambulance transport.",

Introduction to Vehicle Extrication and Special Rescue in EMS\nThis chapter covers vehicle extrication and special rescue operations for ems\npersonnel.\nIt details ems rescue operations, including vehicle extrication and its 10\nphases.\nVarious specialized components of ems operations are described, such as\ntactical ems, trench rescue, and high angle rescue.\nThe role of EMTs in these operations is explained.\nSafety aspects of these operations are also discussed.\nEMTs will usually not be responsible for rescue but may assist with\nextrication.\n2. Safety Considerations in Extrication Operations\nExtrication requires mental and physical preparation.\nPriority is patient care, but personal and team safety must come first.\nVehicle safety systems can become hazards after a collision.\nShock-absorbing bumpers may be compressed or loaded.\nApproach vehicles from the side to avoid injury from releasing bumpers.\nAirbags are supplemental restraints required in all cars.\nAirbags fill with gas and quickly deflate.\nAirbags are located in the steering wheel, dash, doors, and seats.\nNon-deployed airbags may inflate spontaneously.\nMaintain clearance around side-impact (5-inch), driver-side (10-inch), and\npassenger-side (20-inch) airbags.\nHaze from deployed airbags is caused by corn starch or talc.\nProtective gear reduces eye or lung irritation.\nalternative fuel vehicles present hazards.\nVehicles can be powered by electricity, hybrid mix, propane, natural gas,\nmethanol, or hydrogen.\nDisconnect the battery to prevent fire or explosion.\nBatteries may be in the trunk or under seats in alternative fuel vehicles.\nHybrid vehicles may have more than one battery.\nHybrid batteries have higher voltage than traditional ones.\nHigh voltage systems may take up to 10 minutes to de-energize.\nAvoid high voltage cables, which are typically orange.\nDamaged high voltage batteries may give off toxic fumes.\nDo not approach vehicles if an unusual odor is detected.\nRetreat if you experience burning in your eyes or throat.\n3. Fundamentals of Extrication: Roles, Responsibilities, and\nCommunication\nYour primary concern in extrication is safety.\nPrimary roles of ems providers are to provide emergency medical care and\nprevent further injury.\nYou may provide care while extrication is ongoing.\nExtrication is removal from entrapment or a dangerous situation.\nentrapment is being caught with no way out or having a body part trapped.\nRoles and responsibilities often vary by jurisdiction.\nems providers assess, provide medical care, triage, package patients, and\nprovide transport.\nThe rescue team secures and stabilizes the vehicle, provides access, and\nextricates patients.\nLaw enforcement controls traffic, maintains order, and establishes a\nperimeter.\nFirefighters extinguish fires, prevent ignition, ensure vehicle safety, and\nremove spilled fuel.\nGood communication and clear leadership are essential for safe and efficient\ncare.\n4. The 10 Phases of Extrication\nThere are 10 phases of extrication.\nPhase Description Source\n1. Preparation Preparing for an incident requiring extrication.\nIncludes pre-incident training and checking tools.\n2. En Route Following procedures and safety precautions\nsimilar to an ambulance call.\n3. Arrival and\nSize Up\nPositioning the ambulance for safety and access.\nPutting on PPE and looking for hazards. Evaluating\nhazards and determining patient count.\n4. Hazard\nControl\nDealing with hazards like downed electrical lines,\nfamily members, bystanders, and unstable vehicles.\nDisconnecting battery cables.\n5. Support\nOperations\nLighting the scene, establishing staging areas, or\nmarking helicopter landing zones. Fire and rescue\npersonnel work together.\n6. Gaining\nAccess\nAccessing the patient after stabilizing the vehicle\nand controlling hazards. Method depends on the\nsituation.\n7. Emergency\nCare\nProviding emergency care to the trapped patient.\nPerforming a primary assessment. Addressing\nhemorrhaging and stabilizing the spine.\n8. Patient\nRemoval\nCoordinating with rescue personnel for the best\nremoval route. Participating in preparation for\nremoval. Re-evaluating the need for rapid\nextrication.\n9. Transfer Performing a complete primary assessment after\nfreeing the patient. Moving the patient in smooth,\nslow, controlled steps. Moving the patient as a unit.\n10.\nTermination\nReturning units to service. Checking and cleaning\nequipment and the ambulance. Completing\nnecessary reports.\n5. Gaining Access to the Patient\nGaining access is a critical phase of extrication.\nThe way to gain access depends on the situation, including terrain and\nvehicle position.\nConsider the patient\u0027s location and position, hazards, and vehicle stability.\nRapid vehicle extrication may be needed for urgent situations.\nThis is done to quickly remove a patient if the environment is threatening\nor CPR is needed.\nExperienced EMTs can perform this in one minute or less.\nProtect the patient from hazards during assessment and extrication.\nAlways describe actions to the patient, even if unresponsive.\nMinimize heat, noise, and force.\nsimple access is trying to get the patient out quickly without tools or\nbreaking glass.\nAutomobiles are built for ease of entry and exit.\nUse door handles or roll down windows before breaking glass.\nForcible entry tools may be necessary.\nThe rescue team should provide access.\nIf the rescue team hasn\u0027t arrived, use tools like hammers, pry bars, or\nhacksaws if available.\ncomplex access requires special tools and training.\nThis includes pneumatic or hydraulic devices.\nIt also includes breaking windows and removing roofs.\nThese advanced skills are typically done by specialized teams.\n6. Emergency Care and Patient Removal During Extrication\nProviding emergency care to a trapped patient is similar to any other patient.\nPerform a primary assessment and provide care once the scene is safe.\nAddress hemorrhaging with direct pressure or a tourniquet.\nProvide manual stabilization for the cervical spine.\nOpen the airway and give high-flow O2 if needed.\nAssist with ventilations if necessary.\nControl external bleeding and treat critical injuries.\nRescue personnel should coordinate with you on the best removal route.\nParticipate in preparing for patient removal.\nDetermine the urgency of extrication.\nDetermine where to position yourself to protect the patient.\nPlan how to move the patient to the backboard and stretcher.\nYour input helps the rescue team plan extrication that protects the patient.\nRe-evaluate if rapid extrication is needed.\nYou will often be placed in the vehicle alongside the patient.\nWear proper protective equipment.\nPerform a complete primary assessment once the patient is freed.\nManually stabilize the spine.\nMove the patient with smooth, slow, controlled steps.\nDesignate one person to be in charge of the move.\nChoose a path that requires the least manipulation.\nEnsure everyone understands the steps and is ready.\nMove only on the team leader\u0027s command.\nMove the patient as a unit.\nContinue to protect the patient from hazards.\nContinue additional assessment and treatment after placing the patient on\nthe stretcher.\n7. Specialized Rescue Situations\nSometimes patients can only be reached by teams trained in special technical\nrescues.\nThese teams have special skills.\nSpecialized\nRescue Type\nDescription and Considerations Source\nTechnical\nRescue\nSituations\nRequires special skills and equipment. Only\ntrained personnel should enter. Many team\nmembers are also EMRs or EMTs. Ensure the\nteam is summoned and en route.\nSearch and\nRescue\nAmbulance is usually summoned to the incident\ncommand post when a person is lost outdoors.\nYour role is to stand by until the person is found.\nMay stay with family members.\nTrench Rescue Cave-ins and trench collapses often have poor\noutcomes. Falling dirt weighs about 100 pounds\nper cubic foot. Risk of secondary collapse exists.\nVehicles must park 500 feet away.\nTactical\nEmergency\nMedical Support\nEMTs take precautions due to potential violence.\nResponding units wait until law enforcement\nsecures the scene. Specially trained EMTs are\nincorporated into SWAT units.\nStructure Fires Ambulance is often dispatched with the fire\ndepartment. Ask the incident commander where\nto park and stage. Determine if there are injured\npatients or if you are standing by.\nTrench collapse victims may become hypoxic from dirt weight.\nAll vehicles should be turned off at trench scenes to avoid vibration.\nRoad traffic should be diverted from the 500-foot safety area.\nConstruction vehicles at the site may be unstable.\nMedical or rescue personnel should never enter a trench without proper\nshoring.\nMedical personnel trained in these rescues provide most medical care.\nBe prepared to receive patients once extricated.\nFor tactical situations, wait for law enforcement to secure the scene.\nMany communities integrate trained EMTs into police SWAT units.\nReport to the incident commander for instructions at tactical scenes.\nTurn off lights, sirens, and outside radio speakers when nearing the scene.\nThe command post is usually in an area safe from the suspect.\nRemain in the command post area.\nPlanning measures are key in tactical situations.\nThe incident commander identifies locations, determines scene safety, and\ndesignates landing zones.\nSearch and rescue in a burning building requires special training and\nequipment.\nFirefighters in turnout gear and breathing apparatus perform these\noperations.\nHazardous materials can complicate a scene.\n8. Key Takeaways and Review Questions\nProper protective equipment varies depending on hazards.\nBlood and fluid impermeable gloves should be used during all patient\ncontacts.\nThe first phase of extrication is preparation.\nIf a power line is entangled in a wrecked vehicle, retreat until the power is off.\nEntering a vehicle by breaking a back window is complex access because it\nrequires tools.\nsimple access is rolling the window down.\nOnce access is gained to a patient pinned by the steering wheel, perform a\nprimary assessment and provide emergency care.\nWhile the EMT is assessing the patient in the vehicle, the rescue team\nassesses entrapment and determines the safest way to extricate.\nProper removal of a critically injured patient involves moving in slow, smooth,\ncontrolled steps as a unit.\nRescue from a grain silo bin is a confined space rescue.\nA backboard should be left in the ambulance during a search in a wooded\narea.\nAt a trench collapse scene, the ambulance should be parked at least 500 feet\naway.",

Caring for Patients at a HAZMAT Incident A\n1. Introduction to Incident Management Systems\nSystem Purpose Framework Components\nNational\nIncident\nManagement\nSystem (NIMS)\nTo promote efficient coordination\nof emergency incidents at\nregional, state, and national\nlevels. It provides a framework for\neffective work among federal,\nstate, and local governments,\nprivate sector, and nongovernmental\norganizations.\nCommunication and\ninformation management,\nresource management, and\ncommand management.\nStandard structure includes\nICS, multi-agency\ncoordination systems, and\npublic information systems.\nIncident\nCommand\nSystem (ICS)\nTo ensure responder and public\nsafety, achieve incident\nmanagement goals, ensure\nefficient use of resources and\ncommunication. Goal is to make\nA component of NIMS.\nSometimes referred to as\nthe Incident Management\nSystem.\nbest use of resources to manage\nthe environment and treat\npatients. Designed to control\nduplication of effort and\nfreelancing.\nMass Casualty Incidents (MCIs) refer to any call involving three or more\npatients.\nAn MCI can also be any situation placing great demand on equipment or\npersonnel, requiring a multi-aid response.\nA multi-aid response is an agreement between neighboring EMS systems for\nassistance when local resources are insufficient.\nThese events can be overwhelming due to many patients and limited\nresources.\nDisasters are widespread events disrupting community functions and\nresources.\nDisasters threaten lives and property.\nMany disasters may not involve personal injuries.\nUnlike MCIs, which generally last only a few hours, disasters can require\nresponders for days, weeks, or months.\nUse of ICS helps do the greatest good for the greatest number of people.\nAs an EMT, you typically work within the EMS medical branch under ICS.\nNIMS provides standardization in terminology, resource classification,\npersonnel training, and certification.\ninteroperability, the ability of different agencies and jurisdictions to\ncommunicate, is a key feature of NIMS.\nCommunication is considered the building block of good patient care.\nUsing common terminology and clear text communication helps multiple\nagencies work effectively.\n2. Roles and Responsibilities within the Incident Command\nSystem\nStaff Type Roles Key Responsibilities\nGeneral\nStaff\nCommand, Finance,\nLogistics, Operations,\nPlanning\nManages overall incident operations,\ntactical operations, financial aspects,\nresources, and problem-solving.\nCommand\nStaff\nPublic Information\nOfficer (PIO), Safety\nOfficer, Liaison Officer\nProvides public and media information,\nmonitors scene safety, and relays\ninformation among staff and agencies.\nThe Incident Commander (IC) is in charge of the overall incident.\nLarge incidents with multiple agencies may require a unified command.\nA single command system has one person in charge, even with multiple\nagencies responding.\nEMTs must know who the IC is, how to communicate, and where the\ncommand post is.\nIn very large incidents, EMTs report to a supervisor under the IC.\nAn IC can transfer command to someone with more experience.\nWhen an incident ends, command should be terminated, and agencies\ndemobilized.\nFinance documents all expenditures for reimbursement.\nFinance functions include time, procurement, compensation/claims, and cost\nunits.\nLogistics is responsible for communications, facilities, food, water, fuel,\nlighting, and medical supplies.\nThe Operations section manages tactical operations at large incidents.\nThe Operations section chief supervises personnel working at the scene,\nassigned to branches, divisions, and groups.\nPlanning solves problems as they arise.\nPlanning obtains data, analyzes plans, and works with other sections.\nPlanning develops the incident action plan, a central tool for disaster\nresponse planning.\nThe incident action plan provides clear information on objectives, tactics, and\nassignments.\nThe Safety Officer monitors the scene for hazards to responders and\npatients.\nThe safety officer can stop operations if a rescuer is in danger.\nThe safety officer should remove hazards before they cause injury.\nThe public information officer (pio) provides information to the public and\nmedia.\nThe PIO must keep the media safe and out of the incident.\nPIOs may cooperate in a joint information center.\nThe liaison officer relays information and concerns among command and\ngeneral staff and other agencies.\n3. Operational Aspects of Incident Management\nCommunications has often been a weak point in major incidents.\nIntegrated communications are recommended so all agencies can\ncommunicate quickly.\nUsing common terminology and clear text is important.\nCommunication allows for accountability and instant communication.\nUsing face-to-face communication limits radio traffic.\nAvoid using 10 codes or signals on the radio.\nCommunication problems should be worked out beforehand with designated\nchannels.\nCommunication equipment must be reliable, durable, field-tested, with\nbackups.\nResource Management involves requesting additional resources when\nneeded.\nUpon arrival, responders should check in with the incident commander or\nsupervisor.\nChecking in allows for job tasking, personnel tracking, and accurate cost\ncalculation.\nAn initial briefing provides information, job function, and responsibilities.\nRecord Keeping is important for tracking time and equipment costs for\nreimbursement.\nAccountability means keeping your supervisor informed of your location,\nactions, and completed tasks.\nThis includes advising your supervisor of uncompleted tasks and needed\ntools.\ndemobilization occurs once the incident is stabilized and hazards are\nmitigated.\nThe IC determines which resources are no longer needed and when to begin\ndemobilization.\ndemobilization allows resources to return promptly to their parent\norganizations.\n4. EMS Response within the Incident Command System\nMedical Branch\nComponent\nRole Key Responsibilities\nMedical Branch\nDirector\nSupervises primary roles\nof triage, treatment, and\ntransport.\nEnsures responding EMS units\nwork with ICS.\nTriage\nSupervisor\nIn charge of counting and\nprioritizing patients.\nEnsures initial assessment for\nevery patient. Must not begin\ntreatment until all patients are\ntriaged.\nTreatment\nSupervisor\nLocates and sets up\ntreatment area with\npatient tiers.\nEnsures secondary triage and\nadequate patient care. Assists\nwith moving patients to\ntransportation area.\nTransportation\nSupervisor\nCoordinates\ntransportation and\ndistribution of patients.\nHelps prevent hospital\noverwhelm. Documents transport\nvehicles, patients, and\ndestinations.\nStaging Officer Assigned when multivehicle/\nagency response\nis needed.\nEmergency vehicles need\npermission to enter the scene.\nStaging area should be away\nfrom the scene.\nPhysicians on\nScene\nMake difficult triage\ndecisions, provide\nsecondary triage, provide\nmedical direction.\nCan provide care in the treatment\nsector.\nRehabilitation\nSupervisor\nEstablishes an area for\nresponder protection and\nneeds.\nMonitors responders for stress.\nExtrication and\nSpecial Rescue\nDetermines needed\nequipment and resources.\nCoordinates rescue operations.\nMorgue\nSupervisor\nCoordinates removal of\nbodies and body parts.\nWorks with medical examiners,\ncoroners, DMAT, and law\nenforcement. Morgue area should\nbe out of view and secured.\nPreparedness involves decisions and planning before an incident.\nPreparedness includes planning for likely natural disasters in the area.\nEMS agencies should have a written disaster plan with regular training.\nA copy of the disaster plan should be in each EMS vehicle.\nLocal EMS organizations should develop an assistance program for responder\nfamilies.\nScene size-up begins with dispatch and continues upon arrival.\nInitial assessments and preliminary decisions are made during size-up.\nSize-up is guided by three questions: What do I have? What do I need? What\ndo I need to do?.\nEstablishing Command is done by the most senior official.\nNotification to other responders and requesting resources should occur.\nA command system ensures resources are effectively coordinated.\nCommand must be established early, preferably by the first arriving, most\nexperienced official.\nThe Medical Branch of ICS supervises triage, treatment, and transport.\nEach medical division or group receives a clear assignment before working.\nResponsible personnel remain at their vehicle in the staging area until\nassigned.\n5. Triage Procedures in Mass Casualty Incidents\nTriage\nCategory\nColor Characteristics\nImmediate Red Highest priority; life-threatening injuries requiring\nimmediate attention.\nDelayed Yellow Significant injuries but can tolerate a delay in\ntreatment.\nMinor or\nMinimal\nGreen Walking wounded; minor injuries.\nExpectant Black Likely to die; injuries are severe beyond current\ncapabilities.\ntriage means to sort patients based on injury severity.\nThe goal of triage is to do the greatest good for the greatest number.\ntriage assessment is brief, and patient categories are basic.\nPrimary triage is the initial triage done in the field.\nSecondary triage is done as patients are brought into the treatment area.\nDuring primary triage, patients are briefly assessed and identified, such as by\nattaching a triage tag.\nAfter primary triage, the triage supervisor communicates information to the\nmedical branch director.\nThis information includes the number of patients, the number in each\ncategory, extrication/movement recommendations, and needed resources.\nWhen initial triage is complete, secondary triage (re-triage) allows\nreassessment and category upgrades.\nThere are four common triage categories: Immediate (Red), Delayed (Yellow),\nMinor or Minimal (Green), and Expectant (Black).\nExpectant patients are those likely to die.\nAn orange tag may indicate an immediate category requiring a specific nontrauma\ndestination.\ntriage tags assist in tracking patients and keeping accurate records.\ntriage tags should be waterproof, easily read, color-coded, and clearly show\nthe category.\nTags become part of the patient\u0027s medical record.\nThe transport officer must be able to identify which patient was transported\nby which unit to which destination and their priority.\n6. START and JumpSTART Triage Methods\nSTART stands for Simple triage and Rapid Treatment.\nSTART is one of the easiest triage methods.\nIt uses a limited assessment of the patient\u0027s ability to walk, respiratory status,\nhemodynamic status (pulse), and neurologic status.\nStep 1 (START): On arrival, call out to patients and direct the walking\nwounded to a landmark.\nThe walking wounded are considered green (third priority) patients.\nStep 2 (START): Assess non-walking patients starting with the first one.\nAssess respiratory status.\nIf not breathing, open the airway with a simple maneuver.\nA patient who still does not breathe is triaged as expectant (black).\nIf the patient begins to breathe after opening the airway, tag them as\nimmediate (red), place in recovery position, and move on.\nIf the patient is breathing, estimate the respiratory rate.\nA patient breathing faster than 30 or less than 10 breaths per minute is\ntriaged as immediate (red).\nIf breathing between 10 and 29 breaths per minute, move to the next step.\nStep 3 (START): Assess hemodynamic status by checking for bilateral radial\npulses.\nAn absent radial pulse implies hypotension, so tag as immediate priority (red).\nStep 4 (START): Assess neurologic status by assessing the ability to follow\nsimple commands.\nA patient who is unconscious or cannot follow simple commands is an\nimmediate priority (red).\nJumpSTART triage is used for pediatric patients.\nIt is intended for children younger than one year or appearing to weigh less\nthan 100 pounds.\nJumpSTART also begins by identifying the walking wounded.\nInfants and children not developed enough to walk or follow commands,\nincluding those with special needs, should be taken to the treatment sector\nfor secondary triage.\nJumpSTART has differences in respiratory status assessment compared to\nSTART.\nIf a pediatric patient is not breathing, immediately check for a pulse.\nIf there is no pulse, label the patient as expectant (black).\nIf not breathing but has a pulse, open the airway with a manual maneuver.\nIf the patient does not begin to breathe, give five rescue breaths and check\nrespirations again.\nA child who does not begin to breathe should be labeled as expectant (black).\nThe most common cause of cardiac arrest in children is respiratory arrest.\nThe next step is to assess the respiratory rate.\nThen assess hemodynamic status by feeling the most comfortable pulse.\nAbsence of a distal pulse labels the child as immediate priority (red).\nThe final assessment for neurologic status uses a modified AVPU.\nA child who is unresponsive, responds to pain by posturing, makes\nincomprehensible sounds, or cannot localize pain is tagged as immediate\n(red).\n7. Special Considerations and Destination Decisions in MCIs\nSpecial triage considerations exist for certain patients.\nHysterical and disruptive patients may need handling as immediate priority.\nThey may be transported off-site even if not seriously injured.\nA responder who becomes sick or injured should be handled as an immediate\npriority.\nInjured responders should be transported offsite as soon as possible.\nIn hazmat incidents, patients are identified as contaminated or\ndecontaminated before triage.\nDestination decisions are based on triage category.\nAll patients triaged as immediate (red) or delayed (yellow) should preferably\nbe transported by ground or air ambulance.\nIn extremely large situations, a bus may transport the walking wounded\n(green).\nImmediate priority patients should be transported two at a time until all are\ntransported.\nDelayed category patients can be transported two or three at a time.\nFinally, the walking wounded are transported.\nExpectant patients who are still alive would receive treatment and transport at\nthis time.\nDead victims are handled and transported according to standard operating\nprocedure.\nEarly notification allows receiving facilities to increase staffing and move\npatients.\n8. Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT) Incidents\nNFPA 704 Hazard\nClassification Levels\nDescription\n0 Little if any health problem\n1 Causes some irritation, but only mild\n2 Causes temporary damage or residual injury\nunless prompt treatment\n3 Extremely hazardous; minimal contact causes\nserious injury\n4 So hazardous minimal contact will cause death\nUpon arrival at a possible hazmat incident, you must step back and assess\nthe situation.\nRushing into an unsafe scene can have catastrophic results.\nIf overcome, you will be unable to assist patients.\nOSHA has published the hazwoper standard for hazmat response.\nFirst responders at an awareness level should understand hazardous\nsubstances and their risks.\nThey should understand potential outcomes and recognize the presence of\nhazardous substances.\nFirst responders should be able to identify the substance if possible.\nUnderstanding their role and the need for additional resources is important.\nA hazardous material is any material posing unreasonable risk to persons,\nproperty, or the environment if not properly controlled.\nTrain yourself to look at the whole scene for critical visual indicators.\nhazmat incidents can involve leaks from trucks or trains, emergencies at\nindustrial plants, underground pipe leaks, fuel tank seepage, or vehicle\ncrashes.\nIt is important to approach the scene from a safe location and direction.\nStaying uphill and upwind is a good starting point.\nUse binoculars and view the scene from a safe distance.\nQuestion anyone involved in the incident.\nIdentification can be difficult despite available resources.\nLittle consistency is used on labels and placards.\nDishonest transporters may not label containers appropriately.\nMaintain a high index of suspicion at truck or train tanker accidents.\nA visible cloud, strange smoke, or a leak/spill can indicate a hazmat incident.\nAn unusual, strong, harsh odor can be an indicator.\nMany hazardous gases or fluids are odorless.\nIf multiple people collapse or are unconscious with respiratory distress,\nassume a hazmat leak.\nAssume the scene is unsafe in such situations.\nThe safety of you, your team, other responders, and the public is the first\npriority.\nIf you see signs of a hazmat incident, stop at a safe distance.\nPark upwind and uphill from the incident.\nRapidly size up the scene and call for hazmat.\nIf you recognize danger when too close, immediately leave the danger zone.\nAssess the situation rapidly and provide as much information as possible\nwhen calling hazmat.\nDo not re-enter the scene.\nDo not leave the area until cleared by the hazmat team.\nDo not allow citizens to enter the scene.\nAvoid all contact with hazardous material.\nNFPA 704 classifies hazmat according to health hazard, fire hazard, chemical\nreactivity, and special hazards.\nToxicity levels measure the health risk.\nHigher numbers indicate greater toxicity.\nHealth hazard levels except zero require special training and protective gear.\n9. Identifying Hazardous Materials and Information Resources\nHazardous materials are stored in a wide range of occupancies and\nlocations.\nThe location and type of building indicate the possible presence of hazardous\nmaterial.\nSafe senses to use are sight and sound.\nUsing other senses that bring you close to a chemical should be done with\ncaution or avoided.\nClues seen and heard from a distance enable precautionary steps.\nA container is a vessel or receptacle holding the material.\nContainer type, size, and material provide clues about the substance.\nDo not rely solely on container type to determine a hazmat incident.\nContainers can be divided into bulk or non-bulk storage.\nBulk storage containers include fixed tanks, highway cargo tanks, railroad\ntank cars, totes, and intermodular tanks.\nBulk containers are generally found in buildings storing large quantities of a\nchemical.\nBulk containers are often surrounded by a secondary containment system.\nSecondary containment is an engineered method to control a spill if the main\nvessel fails.\nTotes have capacities from 119 to 703 gallons and can hold various chemicals.\nShipping and storing totes can be hazardous as they lack secondary\ncontainment.\nIntermodular tanks are shipping and storage vessels holding 5,000 to 6,000\ngallons.\nNon-bulk storage vessels are all other container types.\nThey hold commonly used commercial and industrial chemicals.\nDrums are recognizable barrel-shaped containers.\nBags are commonly used for solids and powders, like pesticide bags.\nPesticide bags must be labeled with specific information.\nCarboys are used for transporting and storing corrosives and other chemicals.\nUninsulated compressed gas cylinders store substances like nitrogen, argon,\nhelium, and oxygen.\nThe Department of Transportation (DOT) marking system uses labels,\nplacards, and other markings.\nMarking systems indicate hazardous material from a safe distance and\nprovide clues.\nPlacards are diamond-shaped indicators on all four sides of transport\nvehicles carrying hazmat.\nLabels are smaller versions of placards placed on individual boxes and\npackages.\nThe DOT system does not require all chemical shipments to be marked.\nGenerally, a certain amount is required before a placard is needed.\nCommercial package services may carry small amounts below the weight limit\nwithout placards.\nSome chemicals require labels and placards for any amount, such as\nexplosives, poisonous gases, and high-level radioactive substances.\nThe Emergency Response Guidebook (ERG) provides guidance for\nresponders at hazmat sites.\nThe ERG is updated every three or four years and covers about 4,000\nchemicals.\nMaterial Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) are a common information source\nabout chemicals.\nMSDS provide information on chemical makeup, potential hazards, first aid,\nand safe handling.\nFacilities using or storing chemicals must have an MSDS on file for each\nchemical.\nShipping papers are required when materials are transported.\nThey include shipper/receiver names/addresses, material identification,\nquantity, and weight.\nShipping papers for road transport are called bills of lading or freight bills,\nlocated in the vehicle cab.\nChemtrec is operated by the American Chemistry Council.\nChemtrec provides invaluable technical information for first responders.\nWhen calling Chemtrec, have basic information ready: chemical name, caller\ninfo, location, shipper/manufacturer, container info, carrier name, recipient,\nand incident description.\n10. HAZMAT Scene Operations and Control Zones\nControl\nZone\nDescription Purpose/Activity\nHot Zone Area immediately\nsurrounding the\nrelease. Most\ncontaminated area.\nAll personnel and equipment must be\ndecontaminated upon leaving.\nWarm Zone Area where personnel\nand equipment\ntransition into and out\nof the hot zone.\nDecontamination area is set up in the\nwarm zone.\nCold Zone Safe area where\npersonnel do not need\nspecial protective\nclothing.\nPersonnel staging, command post, EMS\nproviders, medical monitoring, support,\nand treatment after decon are located\nhere. EMTs report to a designated area\noutside the hot and warm zones.\nAt a hazmat scene, focus efforts on activities ensuring the safety and survival\nof the greatest number of people.\nUse ambulances and public address systems to alert and direct people near\nthe scene to a safer area.\nYou must establish control zones at a hazmat incident.\nControl zones are based on the chemical/physical properties, environmental\nfactors, and scene layout.\nSecuring access helps ensure no one accidentally enters the contaminated\narea.\nIf the incident is inside a structure, control access at normal points of egress\nand ingress.\nIf the incident is outside, control intersections, on/off ramps, service roads,\nand access routes.\nControl zones may expand or contract as needed.\nThe hot zone is the most contaminated area surrounding the release.\nThe warm zone is the transition area.\nThe decontamination area is set up in the warm zone.\nThe cold zone is the safe area where special protective clothing is not\nneeded.\nCommand post, staging, EMS, and post-decon medical areas are in the cold\nzone.\nAn EMT\u0027s role is to report to a designated area outside the hot and warm\nzones.\nIn the cold zone, EMTs provide triage, treatment, transport, and rehabilitation.\n11. HAZMAT Classification and Personal Protective Equipment\nPPE Level Description Required Equipment\nLevel A Most hazardous. Provides full\nbody protection.\nFully encapsulated, chemicalresistant\nprotective clothing,\nSCBA, special sealed equipment.\nLevel B Requires non-encapsulated\nprotective clothing or clothing\ndesigned for a specific hazard.\nEye protection and breathing\ndevices like SCBA.\nLevel C Requires non-permeable\nclothing and eye protection.\nFace mask with filter for inhaled\nair.\nLevel D Minimal protection. Work uniform, such as coveralls.\nThe NFPA 704 standard classifies hazardous materials.\nClassification is based on health hazard, fire hazard, chemical reactivity, and\nspecial hazards.\nToxicity levels measure the health risk of a substance.\nLevels range from 0 (little health problem) to 4 (minimal contact causes\ndeath).\nLevel 0 causes little if any health problem.\nLevel 1 causes some irritation but is only mild.\nLevel 2 causes temporary damage or residual injury without prompt\ntreatment.\nLevel 3 involves extremely hazardous materials where minimal contact causes\nserious injury.\nLevel 4 involves materials so hazardous minimal contact will cause death.\nAll health hazard levels except zero require special training and protective\ngear not standard on most ambulances.\nPersonal Protective Equipment (PPE) levels indicate the amount and type of\ngear needed.\nLevel A is the most hazardous and requires fully encapsulated clothing, SCBA,\nand sealed equipment.\nLevel B requires non-encapsulated protective clothing, eye protection, and\nbreathing devices like SCBA.\nLevel C requires non-permeable clothing, eye protection, and face masks with\nair filters.\nLevel D is the work uniform providing minimal protection.\nAll PPE levels require the use of gloves.\nTwo pairs of rubber gloves are needed in case one pair must be removed due\nto heavy contamination.\n12. Caring for Patients at a HAZMAT Incident\nIt is only practical to provide the simplest assessment and essential care in\nthe hazardous zone.\nThis is due to dangers, time restraints, and bulky protective gear.\nNo bandages or splints are applied in the hot zone except pressure dressings\nfor bleeding control.\nThe EMT providing care in the treatment area should assess and treat\npatients the same as any other patient.\nCare at a hazmat incident must address two issues: trauma and injury/harm\nfrom exposure to the toxic substance.\nMost serious injuries and deaths result from airway/breathing problems.\nIf a patient is in distress, give oxygen at 12-15 liters via non-rebreather.\nAssist ventilations if needed with a bag valve mask and high flow oxygen.\nTreat the patient\u0027s injuries the same as any injury.\nTreatment for toxic substance exposure should focus on supportive care and\ninitiating transport.\nIt may be necessary to cut away clothing and do a rapid rinse for\ndecontamination before transport.\nYou will need increased protective clothing, including an SCBA, two pairs of\ngloves, goggles or face shield, a protective coat, respiratory depression, and a\ndisposable fluid impervious apron.\nThis protective gear helps make decontaminating the ambulance easier.\nTape the cabinet door shut.\nEquipment kits, monitors, and items needed en route should be removed from\nthe patient compartment.\nPlace these items in the front of the ambulance or side compartments before\nloading the patient.\nTurn on the power vent ceiling fan and patient compartment air conditioning\nunit fan.\nWhen leaving the scene, inform the hospital that you are transporting a\ncritically injured patient who has not been fully decontaminated.",

Disaster Management and Public Health Considerations A\n1. Introduction to Terrorism and the EMT\u0027s Role\nYou might respond to a terrorist event during your career.\nThe question is when and where terrorists will strike again.\nYou must be prepared mentally and physically for a possible terrorist event.\nThere are key principles that apply to every response.\nThe U.S. Department of Justice defines international and domestic terrorism.\nThey involve violent or dangerous acts that violate law.\nThese acts intend to intimidate a population or influence government policy.\nMass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping can affect government conduct.\nInternational terrorism occurs primarily outside the United States\u0027 jurisdiction.\nDomestic terrorism occurs primarily within the United States\u0027 jurisdiction.\n2. Types of Terrorism and Emerging Threats\nModern-day terrorism is common in the Middle East.\nDomestic terrorists have carried out multiple attacks in the United States.\nOnly a small percentage of groups turn towards terrorism.\nExamples include religious extremist groups or doomsday cults.\nExtremist political groups also use terrorism.\nViolent supremacy groups are included.\nGroups seeking political, religious, economic, and social freedoms can be terrorists.\nCyber terrorists are also a type.\nSingle-issue groups may also turn to terrorism.\nAn alarming new trend is the lone wolf terrorist attack.\nThis is a frequent threat in the United States.\nLone wolf terrorism is violence or threat of violence by a single actor.\nThe actor pursues political change linked to an ideology.\nThey do not receive orders or support from outside sources.\nThe motives of a lone wolf terrorist are not always clear.\nAttacks may be targeted at schools, festivals, or shopping centers.\nThese attacks are difficult to predict.\nMany lone wolf attacks involve firearms.\nThis type of event is classified as an active shooter event.\nactive shooter events have prompted discussion of gun laws and mental health.\nEducation of the public and first responders on treating casualties is also discussed.\nThe Hartford Consensus recommends a THREAT response plan.\nTHREAT stands for threat suppression and hemorrhage control.\nRapid extrication to safety is included.\nAssessment by medical providers is part of the plan.\nFinally, transport to definitive care is included.\nEMS crews may be equipped with ballistic vests and helmets.\nThey can assist law enforcement with threat and evacuation.\nInteragency training is key for EMS crews working with law enforcement.\nType of\nTerrorism\nPrimary\nLocation\nKey Characteristics Examples\nInternational\nTerrorism\nPrimarily\noutside the\njurisdiction of\nthe United\nStates\nViolent acts or acts dangerous\nto human life; intended to\nintimidate or coerce a civilian\npopulation, influence\ngovernment policy, or affect\ngovernment conduct\nCommon in the\nMiddle East\nDomestic\nTerrorism\nPrimarily within\nthe jurisdiction\nof the United\nStates\nViolent acts or acts dangerous\nto human life; intended to\nintimidate or coerce a civilian\npopulation, influence\ngovernment policy, or affect\ngovernment conduct\nMultiple attacks\ncarried out in the\nUnited States;\nincludes lone wolf\nattacks and active\nshooter events\n3. Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMDs): Classification and Overview\nA weapon of mass destruction (wmd) is designed to cause mass death or damage.\nIt can cause mass casualties or massive damage to property and infrastructure.\nInfrastructure includes bridges, tunnels, airports, and seaports.\nAcronyms like be nice or cbrne help remember wmd types.\nbe nice stands for biologic, nuclear, incendiary, chemical, and explosive.\ncbrne stands for chemical, biologic, radiologic, nuclear, and explosive.\nTo date, explosives have been the preferred wmd for terrorists.\nwmds are relatively easy to obtain or create.\nThey are specifically geared towards killing large numbers of people.\n4. Chemical Agents: Types, Effects, and Treatment\nchemical agents are manufactured substances with devastating effects.\nThey can be liquid, powder, or vapor.\nThis depends on the desired route of exposure and dissemination.\nAgents consist of vesicants, respiratory agents, nerve agents, and metabolic agents.\nvesicants are also called blister agents.\nRespiratory agents are also called choking agents.\nmetabolic agents include cyanides.\nType of\nAgent\nPrimary Route\nof Exposure\nSigns and Symptoms Treatment\nVesicants\n(Blister\nAgents)\nSkin contact,\nrespiratory tract\n(if left on\nskin/clothing)\nBurn-like blisters, skin\nirritation/burning/reddening,\nintense skin pain, gray skin\ndiscoloration,\nswollen/closed/irritated eyes,\npermanent eye injury/blindness,\nhoarseness/stridor, severe\ncough, hematemesis, severe\ndyspnea\nNo antibodies for\nmustard or CX\nexposure; British anti-\nLewisite is an antidote\nfor Agent L; decon\nbefore treatment;\nprompt airway support\nif inhaled; burn centers\nbest equipped for\nwounds/infections\nPulmonary\nAgents\n(Choking\nAgents)\nRespiratory tract\n(inhalation/vapor\nhazard)\nRespiratory symptoms like\ndyspnea/tachypnea; damage to\nlung tissue, fluid leaks into\nlungs, pulmonary edema;\ndifficulty breathing\nRemove patient from\natmosphere;\naggressive ABC\nmanagement; patient\nshould rest; no\nantidotes; rest in\nposition of comfort\nwith head elevated;\ninitiate proper\ntransport; consider\nadvanced life support;\nCPAP may benefit;\nadvanced airway\nmanagement needed\nfor some\nNerve\nAgents\nAny route of\nexposure\nExtremely toxic and rapidly\nfatal; cardiac arrest within\nseconds to minutes;\norganophosphate effects;\nmiosis (pinpoint pupils),\nvomiting, bradycardia,\nexcessive salivation, seizures,\ncoma, apnea, respiratory arrest,\nmuscle paralysis\nProvide O2 and\nventilative support;\nuse a DuoDote autoinjector\n(contains\natropine and\npralidoxime chloride)\nMetabolic\nAgents\n(Cyanides)\nAll routes of\nentry\nAffect body\u0027s ability to use\noxygen; low doses: dizziness,\nlightheadedness, headache,\nvomiting; high doses: shortness\nof breath, respiratory distress,\nflushed skin, tachycardia,\naltered mental status, seizures,\ncoma, apnea, cardiac arrest\nRemove all patient\nclothes;\ndecontaminate for\nliquid contamination;\nsupport ABCs\n5. Biological Agents: Types, Dissemination, and Response\nBiologic agents pose difficult issues as wmds.\nThey can be almost completely undetectable.\nDiseases caused by these agents often resemble minor illnesses.\nBiologic agents are grouped as viruses, bacteria, and neurotoxins.\nThey may be spread in various ways.\nDissemination is how terrorists spread the agent.\nA disease vector is an animal that spreads disease after being infected.\ncommunicability is how easily a disease spreads from human to human.\nIf communicability is high, the person is contagious, like with smallpox.\nincubation is the time between exposure and the first symptoms.\nAgent Type Characteristics Dissemination/Communicability Response/Treatme\nViruses Require a living host\nto multiply; invade\nhealthy cells and\nreplicate\nSpread by direct methods\n(respiratory droplets) or vectors\nSome viral agents\nhave vaccines, but\nnot often treatments\nBacteria Do not require hosts\nto multiply; complex\nand larger than\nviruses\nGenerally cause flu-like\nsymptoms initially\nInfections can be\nfought with\nantibiotics\nNeurotoxins Most potent\n(botulinum toxin);\naffect nervous system\nfunction\nCan cause muscle paralysis\nleading to respiratory arrest\nDepends on the\nspecific neurotoxin;\nricin causes\npulmonary edema,\nrespiratory/circulato\nfailure\nSmallpox\n(Virus)\nHighly contagious;\nstarts with high fever,\nbody aches,\nheadaches before\nrash; lesions are\nidentical in\ndevelopment; small\nblisters beginning on\nface/extremities and\nmoving towards\nchest/abdomen\nHighly contagious, high\ncommunicability\nUse standard\nprecautions (exam\ngloves, HEPA filters,\neye protection)\nViral\nHemorrhagic\nFevers\n(VHF) (Virus)\nCaused by viruses like\nEbola, Rift Valley,\nMarburg, yellow fever;\ncauses blood to seep\nout of tissues/blood\nvessels; flu-like\nsymptoms\nprogressing to\ninternal/external\nhemorrhaging\nSpread by viruses All standard\nprecautions must be\ntaken\nAnthrax\n(Bacteria)\nCaused by bacteria\ndormant in a spore;\ngerm released when\nexposed to optimal\ntemperature/moisture;\npulmonary form is\ndeadliest\nRoutes include inhalation,\ncutaneous, GI; inhalation form\npersists as severe cold\nAntibiotics can treat\nsuccessfully; vaccin\navailable\nPlague\n(Bacteria)\nNatural vectors are\ninfected\nrodents/fleas;\nbubonic plague\ninfects lymphatic\nBubonic plague spread by\nvectors; pneumonic plague\nresults from inhalation and is\ncontagious\nUntreated bubonic\nplague can lead to\nsepsis and death;\npneumonic form has\nsystem (swollen\nlymph nodes);\npneumonic plague is a\nlung infection\nmuch higher death\nrate than bubonic\nBotulinum\nToxin\n(Neurotoxin)\nMost potent\nneurotoxin; produced\nby bacteria; affects\nnervous system\u0027s\nability to function\nIntroduced into the body Causes muscle\nparalysis leading to\nrespiratory arrest\nRicin\n(Neurotoxin)\nDerived from mash\nleft from castor bean;\nquite stable and\nextremely toxic\nRoutes of exposure include\ninhalation\nCauses pulmonary\nedema,\nrespiratory/circulato\nfailure leading to\ndeath; ingestion\nsigns: fever, chills,\nheadache, muscle\naches, GI symptoms\ndehydration, GI\nbleeding, organ\nnecrosis; inhalation\nsigns: fever, chills,\nnausea, local\nirritation, sweating,\nheadache, muscle\naches, productive\ncough, chest pain,\ndyspnea, pulmonary\nedema, severe lung\ninfections, cyanosis,\nseizures, respiratory\nfailure\n6. Radiological and Nuclear Terrorism\nRadiation is ionizing radiation from rays or particles.\nIt is in the form of rays.\nThis energy is found in radioactive material like rocks or metals.\nRadioactive material emits radiation and is unstable.\nIt attempts to stabilize through a natural process called decay.\nEnergy emitted from a strong source includes alpha, beta, gamma, or neutron\nradiation.\nAlpha is the least penetrating type.\nIt cannot move through most objects.\nBeta radiation is slightly more penetrating than alpha.\nIt requires a layer of clothing to stop it.\nGamma rays are faster and stronger than alpha and beta.\nThey penetrate the human body easily.\nLead or several inches of concrete prevent gamma penetration.\nNeutron particles are among the most powerful forms of radiation.\nNeutrons easily penetrate lead.\nSeveral feet of concrete are required to stop neutrons.\nSources of radiological material are generally used for beneficial purposes.\nThese include medicine, killing germs, or construction.\nUsed radiological material is considered waste.\nMaterials are found in hospitals, healthcare facilities, and universities.\nNuclear power plants and chemical/industrial sites also have these materials.\nRadiologic dispersal devices (RDDs) are containers designed to disperse radioactive\nmaterial.\nA dirty bomb can injure victims with radioactive material and the explosive.\nThe destruction capability of a dirty bomb is limited to the attached explosives.\nA dirty bomb is an ineffective wmd.\nNuclear energy is made by altering or splitting radioactive atoms.\nThis results in immense energy, usually heat.\nNuclear material is used in medicine, weapons, naval vessels, and power plants.\nNuclear material gives off all forms of radiation, including neutrons.\nNuclear weapons are kept only in secure facilities.\nThe likelihood of a nuclear attack is extremely remote.\nSmall nuclear devices (SADMs) are believed to be missing since the Soviet Union\u0027s\ncollapse.\nPatients exposed to excessive radiation are victims of acute radiation toxicity.\nThe effect varies based on the amount of radiation and route of entry.\nRadiation can be introduced by all routes and through the body (irradiation).\nBeing exposed to radiation does not make a patient contaminated.\nPatients with a radioactive source on their body are contaminated.\nThey must be initially cared for by hazmat responders.\nOnce deconned, you may treat them.\nStart with ABCs and treat for burns or trauma.\nWear appropriate PPE.\nSecure plastic bags with body fluids obtained from the patient.\nProperly dispose of fluids with other potentially radioactive waste.\nNo suits completely shield from radiation.\nBest protection is time, distance, and shielding.\n7. Explosive and Incendiary Devices\nExplosive and incendiary devices are weapons used to start fires.\nTerrorists use flamethrowers, chemicals, and other devices.\nIt is important to identify potential devices.\nNotify proper authorities and safely evacuate the area.\nRemember the possibility of secondary devices.\nSecondary devices are set to explode after the initial bomb.\nThey are intended to injure responders and secure media coverage.\nMechanisms of injury depend on the patient\u0027s distance from the explosion.\nBlast explosions occur in several ways.\nPrimary blast is due to direct pressure effects on the body.\nInjury is almost exclusively in hollow organs.\nSecondary injury is from being struck by flying debris.\nTertiary blast results from whole-body displacement and impact with the environment.\nOther indirect effects include crush injury from structure collapse.\nQuaternary blast injury includes any other injury caused by the blast.\nThis includes toxic inhalation of gas or burns.\nMedical emergencies sustained while fleeing are quaternary injuries.\nMental health disorders developing after the explosion are also included.\nThe physics of an explosion involve a substance converting to large gas volumes\nunder pressure.\nThis releases explosive energy.\nA spherical blast wave extends in all directions.\nFlying debris and high winds cause conventional blunt and penetrating traumas.\nTissues at risk are hollow organs like the middle ear, lungs, or GI tract.\nThese are susceptible to pressure changes.\nJunctions between tissues of different densities and exposed tissues are prone to\ninjury.\nThe ear is sensitive to blast injuries.\nPatients may report tingling or pain in the ears or hearing loss.\nPrimary blast injuries in the ear occur as contusions and hemorrhages.\nSolid organs are relatively protected from the shock wave.\nThey may be injured by a secondary missile.\nHollow organs may be injured by similar mechanisms as lung tissue.\nLarge hematomas are the most visible sign of TQI.\nAccording to the CDC, blast lung is the most common cause of death.\nNeurologic injuries and head trauma are also common causes of fatality.\nExtremity injuries, including traumatic amputations, are common.\nPatients may die of massive hemorrhage without rapid tourniquet application.\n8. EMT Response Principles and Scene Safety\nThe basic foundation of patient care remains the same.\nTreatment can vary slightly.\nAlways remember situational awareness.\nRecognize a terrorist event or indicators.\nPlanning of most terror acts is covert.\nPublic safety usually has no prior knowledge of the attack.\nYou must be constantly aware of your surroundings.\nUnderstand the possible risks for terrorism.\nKnow the current threat level from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).\nThe color-coded system was replaced by the National terrorism Advisory System\n(NTAS).\nAlerts from the NTAS summarize the threat and actions to take.\nFirst responders, government agencies, and the public can use this information.\nBe aware of NTAS information at the start of your workday.\nMake observations on every call for situational awareness.\nConsider the type of call and location.\nNote the number of patients.\nListen to victim statements.\nLook for any pre-incident indicators.\nRemember scene safety when responding.\nStage your vehicle a safe distance from the incident.\nWait for law enforcement to advise if the scene is secured.\nIf you doubt safety, do not enter.\nThe best staging location is upwind and uphill from the incident.\nFailure to park safely endangers you and your partner.\nIf your vehicle is blocked or damaged, you cannot transport victims or escape.\nBe aware of secondary devices.\nresponder safety includes personal protective equipment (PPE).\nThe best protection is preventing contact with the agent.\nThe greatest threats are contamination and cross-contamination.\nMake notification procedures as soon as you suspect an attack.\nNotify dispatch when you suspect a terrorist attack or wmd.\nTell dispatch the nature of the event and needed resources.\nProvide the estimated number of patients.\nGive the upwind route of approach or an optimal approach.\nIt is important to establish a staging area for other units.\nOnly trained responders with proper PPE should handle a wmd event.\nKeep in mind there may be more than one event or device.\nEstablish command as the first provider on scene.\nThe EMT may need to establish command until more personnel arrive.\nEMTs may function as medical branch, triage, treatment, or transport supervisors.\nThey can also be logistics officers or command/general staff.\nIf the incident command system is in place, find the medical staging officer for\nassignment.\nReassess scene safety constantly.\nThis is an important component of situational awareness.\nKey Principle Description Source\nSituational\nAwareness\nBeing constantly aware of surroundings and potential risks\nfor terrorism; knowing the current threat level and NTAS\nalerts; making observations on every call (type, location,\nnumber of patients, victim statements, pre-incident\nindicators)\nScene Safety\nand Staging\nStaging vehicle a safe distance from the incident; waiting\nfor law enforcement to secure the scene; not entering if\nscene is unsafe; staging upwind and uphill; parking vehicle\nin a safe location to avoid being blocked or damaged\nSecondary\nDevices\nAdditional explosives set to injure responders and gain\nmedia coverage; possibility must be remembered when\nresponding\nResponder\nSafety and PPE\nPreventing contact with the agent is best protection; being\naware of contamination and cross-contamination; wearing\nappropriate PPE\nNotification\nProcedures\nNotifying dispatch when a terrorist attack or WMD is\nsuspected; providing nature of event, needed resources,\nestimated patients, and approach route\nEstablishing\nCommand\nThe first provider on scene may need to establish\ncommand; EMTs may function in various roles within the\nincident command system\nReassessing\nScene Safety\nConstantly assessing and reassessing the safety of the\nscene as an important component of situational awareness\n9. Disaster Management and Public Health Considerations\nOther EMT roles include syndromic surveillance.\nThis involves monitoring patients in emergency departments and alternate care\nfacilities.\nYou may need to record EMS call volume.\nMonitoring the use of over-the-counter medicines may also be required.\nPatients with flu-like symptoms are particularly important.\nDispatch operations need awareness of unusual call numbers or unexplainable\nsymptom clusters.\nThis is important if clusters come from a particular region or community.\nPoints of distribution (PODs) are part of the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS).\nPODs are existing facilities established for mass distribution of medical supplies.\nSupplies include antibiotics, antidotes, vaccines, and other medical materials.\nMedications can be released in push packs by the CDC\u0027s SNS.\nThese push packages have a delivery time of about 12 hours anywhere in the country.\nEMTs, AEMTs, and paramedics may assist in medication delivery to the public.\nYour role may include triage, treatment, and transport.\nThis chapter covers the essential aspects of terrorism response and disaster management for\nEMTs .",
