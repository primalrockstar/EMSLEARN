Introduction to Communications and Documentation in EMS\nCommunication is sending information from one person to another [4]. This\ncan be verbal or through body language, which is non-verbal [4].\nEffective communication is a key part of pre-hospital care [5].\nIt helps build a good relationship with patients and co-workers [6].\nVerbal skills let you gather information from patients and bystanders [8].\nCommunication helps coordinate with other responders at a scene [8]. It is\nalso vital for transferring patient care to hospital staff [8].\nDocumentation is the written or electronic record of patient care [9].\nIt proves that appropriate care was given [10]. It also shares the patient's story\nwith those providing future care [10].\nGood reporting and records ensure care continues smoothly [11]. They also\nensure proper transfer of responsibility [11].\nRecords help comply with health department and law enforcement rules [11].\nThey meet administrative needs of your organization [11].\nDocumentation also helps fund EMS research [12].\nCommunication systems like computers, radio, and telephone connect EMTs\nto other services [12]. You must know how to use these systems effectively [13]\n.\n2. Therapeutic Communication and Special Populations\ntherapeutic communication uses verbal and non-verbal methods [15]. It\nencourages patients to share their feelings [15]. It builds a positive relationship\nwith each patient [15].\nThe Shannon Weaver communication model helps understand\ncommunication [16]. It has five parts: sender, thought, message, receiver, and\nfeedback [18]. The sender encodes a thought into a message and sends it to\nthe receiver [18]. The receiver decodes the message and sends feedback [19].\nSeveral factors and strategies affect communication [20]. These include age,\nculture, body language, eye contact, and voice tempo [20].\nethnocentrism is thinking your culture is better than others [27]. People with\nthis view interpret messages through their own perspective [28].\ncultural imposition is forcing your views on others [28]. Healthcare providers\nmight do this, thinking their views are superior [28].\nFactor/Strategy Description Evidence\nAge, Culture,\nExperience\nInfluences how a person communicates\n[21]\nBody Language, Eye\nContact\nGreatly affected by culture; powerful\ncommunication tools\n[22]\nFacial Expressions Can show the mood of the patient\n[29]\nClothing, Sex, Posture Factors to consider during\ncommunication\n[20]\nEducation Influences how a person communicates\n[21]\nVoice Tempo, Volume Offer clues about mood and importance\nof message\n[25]\nEnvironment Can affect communication (e.g., noise)\n[20]\nWhen communicating with older patients, identify yourself and be competent\n[76]. Do not assume they are confused [76]. Assess for medical reasons behind\nconfusion [77]. Approach slowly and allow time for responses [78]. Be patient\nand watch for confusion or sensory issues [78]. Locate personal items like\nhearing aids or glasses [82]. Share concerns about their home or pets with\nhospital staff [83].\nWhen communicating with children, understand their fear [84]. Allow them to\nkeep a favorite toy [84]. Have a family member nearby if possible [84]. Be\nhonest about procedures [85]. Respect their modesty [86]. Use an appropriate\ntone and vocabulary [87]. Position yourself at their level [88].\nWhen communicating with hearing impaired patients, position yourself so\nthey can see your lips [90]. Be careful not to lose hearing aids [90]. Have paper\nand a pen available [91]. Speak slowly and distinctly, never shouting [91]. Listen\ncarefully and give short answers [91]. Learning simple sign language phrases\nlike sick, hurt, and help can be useful [92].\nWhen communicating with visually impaired patients, ask if they can see at\nall [94]. Explain everything you are doing [96]. Stay in physical contact [97].\nTransport mobility aids like a cane [98]. If possible, transport guide dogs with\nthe patient [99]. Arrange care for the dog if it cannot be transported [100].\nWhen communicating with non-English speaking patients, you must still get\na medical history [102]. Use short, simple questions [102]. Point to body parts\n[103]. Use a family member or friend to interpret until a professional is available\n[103]. Consider learning common phrases in other languages [104]. Pocket\ncards or translation apps can help [105]. Remember to ask for a translator at\nthe hospital [106].\n3. Nonverbal and Verbal Communication Techniques\nNonverbal communication, or body language, provides more information\nthan words alone [29].\nFacial expressions, body language, and eye contact are important [29].\nPay attention to your own body language, especially with hostile patients [33].\nStay calm to diffuse the situation [34]. Assess the scene for safety [35]. Avoid\nan aggressive posture [36]. Make good eye contact but do not stare [37].\nSpeak calmly and confidently [38]. Never threaten the patient verbally or\nphysically [38].\nPhysical factors like noise can obscure a message's meaning [40]. Cultural\nnorms dictate the space between people when communicating [41].\nYour gestures, body movements, and attitude are key to building trust [42].\nVerbal communication involves asking questions [45].\nopen-ended questions require detailed answers [45]. Use them whenever\npossible [45]. An example is, \"What seems to be bothering you?\" [46].\nClosed-ended questions have short answers like yes or no [46]. Use these if\nthe patient cannot give long answers [47]. An example is, \"Are you having\ntrouble breathing?\" [47].\nSeveral tools can help obtain information [49]. facilitation encourages patients\nto talk more [49]. A pause gives them time to think and respond [50]. reflection\nis restating their words to confirm understanding [51]. empathy is being\nsensitive to their feelings [53]. clarification asks them to explain what they\nmeant [54]. confrontation makes a patient in denial focus on urgent issues [55]\n. interpretation restates the complaint to confirm understanding [56].\nExplanation provides factual information [57]. A summary provides an\noverview of the conversation and next steps [58].\nTouch can show care and compassion [58]. Use it consciously and sparingly\n[59]. Approach slowly and touch the shoulder or arm respectfully [59]. Avoid\ntouching intimate areas for communication purposes [60].\nInterview techniques to avoid include giving false assurance or unsolicited\nadvice [60]. Do not ask leading or biased questions [61]. Avoid talking too much\nor interrupting [61]. Do not use \"why\" questions, authoritative language, or\njargon [61].\nFamily, friends, and bystanders can be helpful [62]. Allow the patient to\nanswer if possible [62]. Do not be afraid to ask others to step aside [63]. Decide\nif their presence helps or hinders care [64].\nGolden rules help calm and reassure patients [64]. Make eye contact and\nkeep it [64]. Provide your name and use the patient's proper name [64]. Tell the\ntruth [64]. Use language they understand [64]. Be careful what you say about\nthe patient [64]. Be aware of your body language [64]. Speak slowly and clearly\n[64]. If the patient is hard of hearing, face them [64]. Allow time for answers [64]\n. Act and speak calmly and confidently [64].\n4. Emotional Intelligence in EMS\nemotional intelligence involves people skills [65]. It is the ability to\nunderstand and manage your own emotions [65]. It also means properly\nresponding to the emotions of others [65].\nIt helps diffuse conflicts and build rapport [66]. It leads to more effective\ncommunication [66]. It helps manage difficult situations [66].\nAttributes of emotional intelligence include self-awareness, recognizing your\nemotions and their effect [67]. Self-regulation is controlling impulsive\nemotions and behaviors [67]. Motivation is motivating yourself and others\npositively [68]. empathy is understanding others' concerns and needs [69].\nSocial skills are developing positive relationships through effective\ncommunication [70].\nTo improve emotional intelligence, assess how you react to stress [71]. Work\non staying calm with minor irritations [71]. Practice mindfulness [72]. Focus on\nthe present moment without blame [72]. Take responsibility for your actions\n[72]. Consider how your actions affect others [72].\nThe behavioral change stairway model helps manage crisis situations [73].\nSteps include active listening, displaying empathy, building rapport, and\nexerting influence [75].\n5. Mission Critical Communications and Patient Handover\nMission critical communications are those where disruption causes task\nfailure [107].\nA shared mental model is important for teams to work effectively [109]. It is\nthe shared understanding of what is happening [109].\nBuilding this model requires answering four questions [111]. What is the\npatient's main priority? What is the history of prior care? What is the patient's\ncurrent state? What are the patient's immediate needs? [111]. Answering these\nquestions quickly helps avoid errors [111].\nEffective patient care handover is crucial for good patient care [112].\nHandover is the transfer of patient information and responsibility [113].\nCommunication failures during handover are a source of medical liability [114].\nWhen giving a handover report, initiate eye contact [115]. Manage the\nenvironment to reduce distractions [115]. Ensure ABCs (airway, breathing,\ncirculation) if priority care is needed [116]. Provide a structured report [117].\nAcronyms like SBAR (Situation, Background, Assessment, Recap of\nTreatment) or SBA2T (Situation, Background, Assessment, Treatment) can be\nused [117].\nThe verbal report should include the patient's priority condition, prior care,\ncurrent state, and immediate needs [118].\nWhen receiving a handover report, maintain eye contact [119]. Manage the\nenvironment [119]. Ensure understanding [119]. Summarize the report [119].\nGather supplementary patient documentation [119].\n6. Written Communications and Documentation: The Patient Care\nReport (PCR)\nThe patient care report (pcr), also known as the pre-hospital care report, is a\nlegal document [121]. It records all aspects of patient care from dispatch to the\nhospital [122].\nPCRs can be written or electronic [123].\nThe PCR serves six functions [124].\nFunction of the PCR Description\nExamples of information collected on the PCR include chief complaint and\nmechanism of injury [127]. It also includes the level of consciousness, vital\nsigns, and ongoing assessment [127]. Patient demographics, transport\ninformation, and destination choice are documented [127].\nAdministrative information includes incident times, such as dispatch, arrival on\nscene, and arrival at the facility [129]. It also notes when patient care was\ntransferred and the unit was back in service [129].\nElectronic PCRs (ePCRs) comply with nemsis data requirements [131]. They\ncan transmit information directly to hospital computers [131].\nThe narrative section of the PCR is very important [132]. Two common\nnarrative formats are CHART and SOAP [132].\nThe CHART method stands for Chief complaint, History, Assessment,\nTreatment, and Transport [133]. It starts with dispatcher information and the\nchief complaint [135]. History includes details of the current event and medical\nhistory [137]. Assessment describes all assessments, including vital signs [140].\nTreatment details all interventions performed [141]. Transport explains how the\npatient was moved, positioned, and taken to the hospital [142].\nThe SOAP method stands for Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan\n[143]. Subjective includes information from the patient or others [145]. Objective\ndetails are gathered from your assessment, vital signs, and physical findings\n[146]. Assessment summarizes key findings and provides your impression of\nthe problem [147]. Plan documents the treatment provided [148].\nRegardless of the method, the narrative should include times of events and\nassessment findings [148]. It should also detail emergency care provided and\nchanges in the patient [148]. Observations at the scene and final patient\ndisposition are included [148]. Refusal of care and the name of the person\ntaking over care must be documented [148]. Avoid radio codes and\nabbreviations [148].\nAll PCRs are confidential documents [149]. Once complete, distribute copies\nto appropriate locations [149].\n7. Health Information Exchanges (HIEs) and Reporting Errors\nHealth Information Exchanges (HIEs), abbreviated as HIE, improve data\nsharing [150]. They allow EMS to share data with other healthcare providers\n[151].\nHIEs let EMS providers access relevant patient data [152]. They help avoid\nduplicating data entry [152]. They allow viewing patient outcomes related to\nhospital care [152].\nEMTs can contribute to and access electronic health information through HIEs\n[153].\nMost HIEs follow the SAFER framework [154]. SAFER stands for Search, Alert,\nFile, and Reconcile [154].\nSearch means EMS can search for hospital records [155]. This helps with\ntreatment and transport decisions [155]. Alert means hospitals are notified of\nincoming patients [156]. Information from the EMS ePCR populates hospital\ndashboards [156]. File means data from the EMS ePCR is put into the patient's\nhealth record [157]. Reconcile provides feedback to EMS agencies on patient\noutcomes [157]. This data is used for billing and quality improvement [158].\nIt is important to report errors accurately [159]. Do not try to cover up\nomissions or inaccuracies [159]. This is falsification and can lead to poor care,\nsuspension, or legal action [159].\nThe proper way to correct a mistake on a handwritten report is to draw a\nsingle horizontal line through the error [160]. Initial it and write the correct\ninformation next to it [161].\nIf an error is found after submitting, follow the same process [162]. Add a note\nwith the correct information [162].\nIf information was omitted, begin a new section with the word \"addendum\"\n[163]. Add the new information and your dated initials [164].\nNever use correction fluid or erase errors [165].\n8. Documenting Refusal of Care and Special Reporting Situations\nDocumenting refusal of care is very important [166]. It is a common source of\nlawsuits [166].\nThorough documentation is crucial [166].\nInclude all assessment findings and emergency care given [167]. Have the\npatient sign a refusal of care form [167]. Have a witness like a family member or\npolice officer also sign [167].\nDocumentation should include evidence the patient made a rational,\ninformed decision [167]. Detail discussions about recommended care and\npotential consequences of refusal [167]. Include discussions with family or\nbystanders who tried to encourage care [167]. Note discussion with medical\ndirection if required by protocol [167].\nAlso document providing the patient with alternatives [168]. Examples include\nseeing their family doctor or having someone drive them to the hospital [168].\nDocument the willingness of EMS to return [168]. Obtain signatures and\ncomplete the PCR [168].\nSpecial reporting situations depend on local requirements [169]. Examples\ninclude gunshot wounds and dog bites [169]. Certain infectious diseases,\nsuspected abuse (physical or sexual), and mass casualty incidents (MCIs) are\nalso special situations [169].\n9. Communication Systems and Equipment\nRadio and telephone communications connect EMS teams with other\nservices [170]. This includes fire and law enforcement [170]. They help the entire\nteam work together and provide safety [171].\nA base station radio contains the transmitter and receiver [172]. It is usually in\na fixed location [172]. A channel is an assigned frequency for communications\n[173]. A dedicated line, or hotline, is for specific point-to-point contact [174].\nA mobile radio is installed in a vehicle like an ambulance [176]. Ambulances\noften have more than one [177].\nPortable radios are handheld [178]. They are essential at MCI scenes or when\naway from the ambulance [178]. They help communicate with dispatch, other\nunits, or medical control [179].\nRepeater-based systems use a special base station radio called a repeater\n[180]. The repeater receives signals on one frequency and transmits them on\nanother [181]. This allows units that cannot reach each other directly to\ncommunicate [181].\nDigital equipment is used in the field [185]. Telemetry converts electronic\nsignals into coded audible signals [186]. These can be sent by radio or phone\nto a hospital receiver [187]. It is used for data from cardiac monitors [187].\nCellular and satellite telephones are also used [189]. EMTs often use cellular\nphones to talk to hospitals [189]. Satellite phones are another option [189].\nA scanner searches across several frequencies [190]. It stops when it receives\na broadcast [190]. Conversations can be easily overheard [191].\nAmbulances usually have an external public address system [192].\nTwo-way radio hardware includes simplex, duplex, and multiplex [193].\nSimplex is push-to-talk, release-to-listen [194]. Duplex allows simultaneous\ntalk and listen [195]. Multiplex uses multiple frequencies for simultaneous\ntransmissions [195].\nMED channels are reserved for EMS use [196]. Trunking systems assign many\nfrequencies and use a computer to find an open one [197].\nMobile data terminals (MDTs) are computers in the ambulance [198]. They\nreceive data from dispatch and provide expanded capabilities [199]. For\nexample, they can show a map to the dispatched address [200].\n10. Regulations and Protocols Governing Radio Communications\nThe Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulates all radio\noperations in the US [202].\nThe FCC has five main EMS-related responsibilities [202].\nThey allocate specific radio frequencies for EMS use [203].\nThey license base stations and assign call signs [204].\nThey establish license standards and specifications for EMS radio\nequipment [205].\nThey set limitations for transmitter power outputs [206].\nThey monitor radio operations [206].\nFCC rules regarding EMS communications are found in Part 90, Subpart B\n[207].\n11. Communication with Dispatch and Medical Control\nThe dispatcher receives the initial 911 call [209]. Their responsibility starts\nwith screening calls and assigning priority [210]. This is done according to\nprotocols [211].\nThey select and alert the correct EMS unit [212]. They direct the unit to the\nlocation [213]. They coordinate EMS with other public safety services [213].\nThey also provide emergency medical instructions to the caller [214].\nThe dispatcher assigns units based on factors like the problem's severity and\nresponse time [215]. The level of training and need for additional support are\nalso considered [215].\nThe dispatcher should give responding units information [216]. This includes\nthe nature and severity of the illness or injury [216]. The exact location and\nnumber of patients are provided [217]. Response of other agencies and special\nadvisories (like traffic or weather) are given [219]. They also provide the time\nthe units were dispatched [219].\nEMTs should report any problems during the run to dispatch [220]. They\nshould inform dispatch upon arrival at the scene [220]. The arrival report\nshould include obvious details from the scene size-up [220].\nRadio communications must be brief and clear [221]. Use plain English and\navoid codes [221]. Report only important information [222].\nThe main reason for radio communication with medical control or hospitals\nis to facilitate communication [223]. Medical control can be at the hospital or\nanother facility [224].\nConsulting with medical control serves many purposes [225]. It notifies the\nhospital of an incoming patient [225]. It allows requesting advice or receiving\norders [225]. It advises the hospital in special situations [225].\nPlan and organize your radio communication before transmitting [226]. A\npatient report to medical control commonly includes 10 elements [226]. These\ninclude unit ID, service level, patient condition, and estimated time of arrival\n[226]. Patient age, gender, chief complaint, and history are included [226].\nPhysical findings, care given, patient response, and any questions from the\nfacility are also part of the report [226].\nThe role of medical control is either offline (indirect) or online (direct) [227].\nYou may need to call medical control for direct orders [227]. This could be for\nadministering certain treatments or determining transport destination [227].\nPermission might be needed to stop treatment or not transport [227].\nIn many areas, medical control is provided by hospital physicians [229].\nHowever, variations exist, and it may come from a freestanding center [230].\nWhen calling medical control, your report must be precise and contain only\nimportant information [232]. Never use codes unless directed by local protocol\n[233].\nAfter receiving an order from medical control, repeat it back word for word\n[234]. Receive confirmation [234]. Do not follow an order that does not make\nsense [235].\n12. Information Regarding Special Situations and Equipment\nMaintenance\nYou may initiate communication with hospitals about extraordinary\nsituations [236].\nNotifying a small rural hospital early about multiple patients from a crash helps\nthem respond [237]. An entire hospital system must be notified of any disaster\n[237].\nOther special situations to relay include hazardous material incidents or\nrescues in progress [238]. Possible multiple casualty incidents (MCIs) should\nalso be communicated [238].\nWhen identifying special situations to the hospital, several points are\nimportant [239]. The earlier you notify them, the better [239]. Provide an\nestimated number of patients needing transport [240]. Identify any special\nneeds patients might have, like burns or hazmat exposure [240]. This helps the\nhospital prepare [241].\nMaintenance of radio equipment is necessary [242]. Like other EMS\nequipment, it must be serviced at the start of each shift [242]. Check your\nradio equipment [243].\nRadio equipment may fail during a run [244]. You must have and follow a\nbackup plan [244].\nStanding orders are written documents signed by the medical director [245].\nThey outline specific directions and permissions [245]. When followed\nproperly, they have the same authority as orders given over the radio [246].",
