Definition and Mechanisms of Shock\nShock, also known as hypoperfusion, is defined as inadequate cellular\nperfusion [4].\nAny compromise in perfusion can lead to cellular injury or death [6].\nIn early stages, the body attempts to maintain homeostasis [6].\nThe cardiovascular system has three parts: the pump (heart), the container\n(blood vessels), and the contents (blood) [13].\nThese three parts are also called the perfusion triangle [16].\nIf one or more parts of the perfusion triangle are not working properly, a\npatient can go into shock [17].\nPoor perfusion impairs the transportation of carbon dioxide out of tissues [11].\nThis results in a dangerous buildup of waste products [11].\nThis buildup can cause cellular damage [12].\nShock is a state of collapse and failure of the cardiovascular system leading to\ninadequate circulation [12].\nTo protect vital organs, the body redirects blood flow from areas tolerant of\nlow flow, like the skin and intestines, to vital organs like the heart, brain, and\nlungs [12].\nEarly recognition and treatment of shock signs and symptoms can save lives\n[12].\nShock is life-threatening and requires immediate recognition and treatment\n[12].\nComponent Description\nThe Pump The heart [14]\nThe Container Blood vessels [14]\nThe Contents The blood [14]\nPerfusion Triangle Components\n-------------------- -------------------------------------\nParts Heart, blood vessels, blood [16]\n2. Causes and Types of Shock\nThere are three basic causes of shock [25].\nThese basic causes relate to the perfusion triangle failing [25].\nThe three basic causes are pump failure, poor blood vessel function, and\nlow fluid volume [26].\nDifferent types of shock result from these basic problems [28].\nTypes of shock include cardiogenic and obstructive shock (pump failure) [29]\n.\nobstructive shock is further broken down into tension pneumothorax, cardiac\ntamponade, and pulmonary emboli [29].\ndistributive shock is a type of poor vessel function [30].\nInside of distributive shock are septic, neurogenic, anaphylactic, and\npsychogenic shock [30].\nhypovolemic shock is a type of low fluid volume shock [31].\nhypovolemic shock is broken down into hemorrhagic and non-hemorrhagic\n[31].\nBasic Cause Resulting Shock Types\nPump Failure Cardiogenic, Obstructive [29]\nPoor Vessel\nFunction\nDistributive (Septic, Neurogenic, Anaphylactic,\nPsychogenic) [30]\nLow Fluid Volume Hypovolemic (Hemorrhagic, Non-Hemorrhagic) [31]\n3. Detailed Overview of Pump Failure Shock (Cardiogenic and\nObstructive)\ncardiogenic shock is a pump failure problem [32].\nIt is caused by inadequate function of the heart [32].\nA major effect is the backup of blood into pulmonary vessels [32].\nThis results in pulmonary edema [32].\ncardiogenic shock is often caused by heart failure or a heart attack [32].\nThe heart cannot maintain output to meet the body's demands [33].\nobstructive shock is also a pump failure problem [36].\nThe heart is unable to work due to a mechanical obstruction [36].\nThis prevents adequate flow of blood from the heart chambers [38].\nThree types of obstructive shock are cardiac tamponade, tension\npneumothorax, and pulmonary emboli [38].\ncardiac tamponade is a collection of fluid between the pericardial sac and\nthe myocardium [38].\nThis fluid prevents the heart from contracting effectively [39].\nIt can be caused by blunt or penetrating trauma causing hemorrhage\naround the heart [41].\nSigns and symptoms are called beck's triad [42].\nbeck's triad includes jugular vein distension, muffled heart tones, and\nnarrowing pulse pressures [43].\ntension pneumothorax is caused by air damaging lung tissue [46].\nAir escapes into the chest cavity and the lung collapses [46].\nUntreated, air accumulates and puts pressure on organs including the\nheart [48].\nThis pressure obstructs the heart's ability to beat [49].\npulmonary emboli are blood clots in the pulmonary circulation [51].\nThey block blood flow through the pulmonary vessels [53].\nA massive pulmonary emboli can prevent blood from being pumped from\nthe right to the left side of the heart [53].\nThis leads to a backup of blood in the right ventricle [53].\nThis can cause catastrophic obstructive shock and complete pump failure\n[53].\n4. Detailed Overview of Poor Vessel Function Shock (Distributive)\ndistributive shock is caused by poor vessel function [55].\nIt results from widespread dilation of small arterioles, venules, or both [58].\nBlood pools in the expanded vascular beds [58].\nTissue perfusion decreases [58].\nThere are different types of distributive shock [58].\nThese include septic, neurogenic, anaphylactic, and psychogenic shock\n[59].\nseptic shock occurs from a severe infection, usually bacteria [60].\nToxins are generated by bacteria or infected tissues [61].\nThere is widespread vessel dilation and plasma loss through vessel walls\n[61].\nDecreased fluid results in shock [61].\nneurogenic shock is usually from a spinal cord injury [62].\nBlood vessel muscles are cut off from nerve impulses [63].\nVessels below the injury dilate widely [64].\nThis increases the size and capacity of the vascular system [64].\nBlood pools, and the body loses the ability to constrict vessels [64].\nanaphylactic shock happens when a person reacts violently to a substance\n[66].\nThis occurs after being sensitized to the substance [68].\nSensitization means becoming sensitive to a substance that didn't initially\ncause a reaction [68].\nEach exposure tends to produce a more severe reaction [69].\npsychogenic shock is a sudden reaction of the nervous system [71].\nIt causes temporary, generalized vascular dilation [71].\nUsually, the patient has a syncopal episode (fainting) [71].\nLife-threatening causes include irregular heartbeat or brain aneurysm [72].\nNon-lethal events include bad news, fear, or unpleasant sights like blood\n[72].\nType of Distributive\nShock\nCause / Characteristics\nSeptic Shock Severe infection (bacteria), toxins, widespread dilation\n[60]\nNeurogenic Shock Spinal cord injury, vessel dilation below injury [62]\nAnaphylactic Shock Severe allergic reaction after sensitization [66]\nPsychogenic Shock Sudden nervous system reaction, temporary dilation,\nfainting [71]\n5. Detailed Overview of Low Fluid Volume Shock (Hypovolemic)\nhypovolemic shock is a fluid issue [73].\nIt is the result of an inadequate amount of fluid or volume in the circulatory\nsystem [73].\nThis is a problem with the blood itself [73].\nThere are two types: hemorrhagic and non-hemorrhagic hypovolemic shock\n[73].\nhypovolemic shock can occur with conditions like thermal burns [74].\n6. Stages and Recognition of Shock\nThere are different stages of shock [74].\nThese include compensated shock, decompensated shock, and\nirreversible shock [74].\nIn compensated shock, the body can maintain perfusion [74].\nOnce shock has progressed too far, it becomes irreversible [74].\nIt is impossible to assess when a patient has reached the irreversible stage\n[74].\nRecognizing and treating shock very early is important [74].\nTreatment is needed well before the patient becomes decompensated [74].\nBlood pressure is the last measurable factor to change with shock [75].\nWhen a drop in blood pressure is evident, shock is well developed [75].\nThis is especially true for infants and children [76].\nInfants and children can maintain blood pressure until they lose more than\nhalf their blood volume [76].\nBy the time their blood pressure drops, they are close to death [76].\nExpect shock in many emergency medical situations [77].\nExpect shock if a patient has conditions such as multiple fractures, abdominal\nor chest injury, spinal injury, severe infection, a heart attack, or anaphylaxis\n[77].\nStage of Shock Characteristics\nCompensated Body is able to compensate, maintains perfusion [74]\nDecompensated Body can no longer compensate effectively [74]\nIrreversible Shock has progressed too far, no recovery possible [74]\n7. Assessment and General Emergency Care for Shock\nBegin with scene size-up to ensure safety [78].\nDetermine the mechanism of injury or nature of illness [78].\nPerform a primary assessment [79].\nIf shock is suspected, do a rapid exam [79].\nDetermine the level of consciousness (LOC) [79].\nIdentify and treat any life-threatening concerns first [79].\nDetermine the priority of patient transport [80].\nControl massive external hemorrhage; this is the first priority [80].\nUse direct pressure first [123].\nIf direct pressure fails, use a tourniquet [81].\nAssess and treat ABCs (Airway, Breathing, Circulation) after controlling lifethreatening\nbleeding [82].\nEnsure a patent airway [85].\nQuickly assess breathing [86].\nAssess circulatory status for clues of shock [86].\nCheck for distal and central pulses [87].\nDetermine if pulse is fast, slow, weak, strong, or absent [87].\nA rapid pulse suggests compensated shock [88].\nAssess skin color, temperature, and condition [90].\nCheck capillary refill [90].\nIf the patient has signs of hypoperfusion, treat aggressively [84].\nProvide high-flow oxygen [83].\nInitiate rapid transport [84].\nRequest advanced life support (ALS) as necessary for aggressive shock\nmanagement [84].\nConsider spinal immobilization if needed [85].\nMaintain inline stabilization if necessary [100].\nComfort, calm, and reassure the patient [101].\nMaintain the patient in the supine position [101].\nDo not allow patients to eat or drink [102].\nPrevent body heat loss by using blankets [104].\nTreat additional injuries en route [105].\nConsider rendezvous with ALS or aero medical transport if needed [105].\nAccurately record vital signs every five minutes throughout treatment and\ntransport [106].\nAfter managing life threats, take a history, including the chief complaint and a\nSAMPLE history [92].\nPerform secondary assessments, including a physical exam [93].\nRepeat the primary assessment and perform a focused assessment [94].\nAssess the entire body if there is significant illness or injury, a poor general\nimpression, problems in the primary assessment, or an unresponsive medical\npatient [94].\nPerform assessments quickly but thoroughly [95].\nIf a life-threatening problem is found, treat it immediately [96].\nTake vital signs [97].\nReassess the patient's vital signs, interventions, chief complaint, ABCs, and\nmental status [97].\nDetermine needed interventions based on findings, focusing on supporting\nthe cardiovascular system [98].\nBegin immediate treatment for shock as soon as it is recognized [99].\nFollow local precautions [100].\nMaintain body temperature by placing blankets under and over the patient\n[104].\n8. Specific Emergency Care for Different Types of Shock\nFor cardiogenic shock:\nThese patients often have chest pain and low blood pressure or a weak,\nirregular pulse [107].\nThey may show cyanosis, anxiety, and nausea [108].\nDo not give nitro if they are hypotensive [108].\nPlace them in a position that eases breathing [109].\nGive high-flow O2 [109].\nInitiate prompt transport and request ALS [109].\nFor obstructive shock:\nFor cardiac tamponade:\nPrioritize increasing cardiac output [111].\nGive high-flow oxygen [111].\nSurgery is the only definitive treatment [111].\nFor tension pneumothorax:\nGive high-flow O2 via a non-rebreather to prevent hypoxia [111].\nChest decompression is required but is an ALS skill [112].\nRequest ALS assistance early but do not delay transport waiting for\nthem [112].\nFor septic shock:\nThis requires hospital management, including antibiotics [113].\nUse standard precautions [113].\nTransport promptly [113].\nGive high-flow O2 and possibly support ventilations with a BVM [114].\nPreserve body heat [114].\nNotify a specialized sepsis team if available [114].\nObtain and maintain a proper airway and assist breathing [115].\nEnsure effective circulation [116].\nTransport to a facility capable of managing neurogenic shock [117].\nFor anaphylactic shock:\nAdminister Epi intramuscularly (IM) as the most effective treatment [118].\nRequires immediate transport [119].\nGive high-flow O2 and possibly assistance with a BVM [119].\nFind out the cause of the reaction and how it was received [119].\nBe aware that a mild reaction can worsen suddenly [119].\nDue to potential airway compromise, request ALS backup as soon as\npossible [119].\nFor psychogenic shock:\nIn uncomplicated fainting, circulation to the brain is restored when the\npatient becomes supine [120].\npsychogenic shock can worsen other types of shock [121].\nIf a patient fell from psychogenic shock, check for injuries, especially in\nolder patients [121].\nIf a patient cannot walk after falling, suspect another problem like a head\nor hip injury [122].\nTransport promptly; all patients with loss of consciousness need\nevaluation at the emergency department [122].\nFor hypovolemic shock:\nStop obvious external bleeding first [123].\nDirect pressure is the best initial method [123].\nIf direct pressure doesn't work, use a tourniquet [123].\nHandle the patient gently and keep them warm [123].\nRecognize internal bleeding and provide aggressive general support [123].\nSecure and maintain an airway and provide respiratory support, including\noxygen and ventilations [123].\nTransport rapidly to the emergency department [124].\nType of Shock Specific Treatment\nCardiogenic Position for breathing, high-flow O2, prompt transport, ALS\nrendezvous [109]\nCardiac\nTamponade\nHigh-flow O2, prompt transport (needs surgery) [111]\nTension\nPneumo\nHigh-flow O2 via non-rebreather, ALS for chest decompression,\nprompt transport [111]\nSeptic Standard precautions, high-flow O2, BVM support, preserve\nbody heat, prompt transport (needs hospital management) [113]\nAnaphylactic Administer Epi IM, immediate transport, high-flow O2, BVM\nsupport, ALS backup [118]\nPsychogenic Check for injuries, prompt transport for all patients with loss of\nconsciousness [121]\nHypovolemic Control external bleeding (direct pressure, tourniquet), secure\nairway, respiratory support, keep warm, rapid transport [123]\n9. Considerations for Pediatric and Geriatric Patients in Shock\nTreating shock in older patients is no different than treating any other shock\npatient [125].\nOlder patients generally have more serious complications than younger\npatients [125].\nMany older patients take numerous medications [125].\nThese medications can mask or mimic signs of shock [125].\nBlood pressure changes are a late indicator of shock, particularly in infants\nand children [76].\nInfants and children can maintain their pressure until they lose more than half\ntheir blood volume [76].\nBy the time pressure drops in infants and children, they are close to death [76].\nProvide inline spinal stabilization if indicated [126].\nIf spinal stabilization is not indicated, maintain the patient in a position of\ncomfort [126].\nControl life-threatening hemorrhages immediately with direct pressure [126].\nSuction as necessary [126].\nProvide high-flow oxygen via a non-rebreather mask [126].\nMaintain body temperature [127].\nProvide rapid transport for all patients in shock, including older and younger\npatients [127].",
