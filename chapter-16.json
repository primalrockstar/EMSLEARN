Introduction to Respiratory Emergencies and Anatomy\nRespiratory emergencies are significant in all age groups, including infants,\nchildren, and adults [2].\nEMTs frequently encounter patients experiencing dyspnea, which means\ndifficulty breathing [5].\nThe cause of dyspnea can be challenging to identify, but timely care can still\nbe life-saving [5].\nUnderstanding the respiratory system's anatomy is crucial for managing these\nemergencies [6].\nThe respiratory system includes the diaphragm, chest wall muscles,\naccessory muscles, and nerves from the brain and spinal cord [7].\nThe upper airway consists of structures above the larynx, such as the nose,\nmouth, jaw, oral cavity, pharynx, and larynx [8].\nThe larynx serves as the division point between the upper and lower airways\n[8].\n2. Physiology of Respiration and Pathophysiology of Impaired\nBreathing\nThe main function of the lungs is respiration, the exchange of oxygen and\ncarbon dioxide [10].\nAir travels through the trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, and finally to the alveoli\nwhere gas exchange happens [11].\nRespiration involves two processes: inspiration and expiration [12].\nOxygen enters the blood, and carbon dioxide is removed [13].\nIn healthy lungs, this exchange occurs rapidly at the alveoli through diffusion\n[13].\nThe brain stem monitors carbon dioxide levels in the blood [16].\nHigh carbon dioxide levels lead to faster, deeper breathing, while low levels\nslow breathing down [17].\nGas exchange can be hindered by airway abnormalities, disease, trauma, or\nissues with pulmonary vessels [19].\nProcess Description Gas Exchange\nInspiration Oxygen is provided to the\nblood\nOccurs rapidly at the alveoli\nthrough diffusion\nExpiration Carbon dioxide is removed\nfrom the body\nCarbon dioxide returns to the lungs\nand is exhaled\n3. Carbon Dioxide Retention and Hypoxic Drive\nSome patients have consistently high levels of carbon dioxide in their blood\n[20].\nOver time, this can impair the respiratory center in the brain [20].\nThis is often seen in patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease\n(COPD) [20].\nTheir ability to exhale carbon dioxide is hindered [21].\nThe brain adapts to these high levels [22].\nIt switches to a backup system based on low oxygen levels to control\nbreathing [22].\nThis backup system is called hypoxic drive [22].\nCaution is advised when giving oxygen to these patients [22].\n4. Causes and Signs of Dyspnea\nDyspnea can result from many different conditions [23].\nAltered mental status can indicate the brain is hypoxic (low oxygen) [23].\nMedical conditions causing difficulty breathing include pulmonary edema, hay\nfever, pleural effusion, airway obstruction, hyperventilation syndrome,\nenvironmental or industrial exposures, carbon monoxide poisoning, or drug\noverdose [23].\nSituations leading to dyspnea can involve breathing too fast, obstructed gas\nexchange by fluid, infection, or collapsed alveoli, damaged alveoli, obstructed\nair passages by spasm, mucus, or weakness, obstructed blood flow to lungs\nby a blood clot, or a pleural space filled with air or fluid [24].\nTable 16-2 in the book shows signs and symptoms of inadequate breathing\n[25].\nDyspnea is common in patients with cardiopulmonary diseases [26].\nCongestive heart failure (CHF) causes the heart to pump poorly, leading to\noxygen deprivation [26].\nSevere pain can also cause rapid, shallow breathing without primary lung\nissues [26].\nCondition Description / Effect on Breathing\nPulmonary Edema Fluid in the lungs [23]\nHay Fever Allergic reaction causing cold-like symptoms [23]\nPleural Effusion Collection of fluid around the lungs [23]\nObstruction of the Airway Mechanical blockage [23]\nHyperventilation Syndrome Over breathing leading to low carbon dioxide levels\n[23]\nEnvironmental/Industrial\nExposures\nInhaling harmful substances [23]\nCarbon Monoxide Poisoning Inhaling odorless, poisonous gas [23]\nDrug Overdose Can cause hypoxia or dyspnea [23]\nCongestive Heart Failure\n(CHF)\nHeart pumps ineffectively, depriving the body of\noxygen [26]\nSevere Pain Can cause rapid, shallow breathing without primary\npulmonary dysfunction [26]\nObstruction of Gas\nExchange\nBy fluid, infection, collapsed alveoli, damaged\nalveoli, mucus, spasm, blood clot, or pleural air/fluid\n[24]\nBreathing Too Fast Can be a sign of dyspnea [24]\n5. Upper and Lower Airway Infections\nInfectious diseases can cause dyspnea by affecting various parts of the\nairway [29].\nInadequate oxygen delivery to tissues is often due to some form of\nobstruction [31].\nInfectious obstructions can include mucus and secretions in major passages\n(like colds or diphtheria), or swelling of soft tissues in the upper airway (like\nepiglottitis or croup) [32].\nStridor is a sound produced by upper airway infections, often described as a\nseal bark [36].\nImpaired oxygen exchange in the alveoli (lower airway) is seen in pneumonia\n[36].\nUsing protective equipment (PPE) is important when in contact with patients\nwith infectious diseases [37].\nCroup is typically seen in children aged 6 months to 3 years, causing\ninflammation and swelling of the pharynx, larynx, and trachea [38]. Hallmarks\nare stridor and a seal bark cough, and it responds well to humidified oxygen\n[41].\nEpiglottitis is inflammation of the epiglottis, usually bacterial and more\ncommon in children, though it can occur in adults [44]. Patients, especially\nchildren, may sit in a tripod position, drool, and should be handled gently with\nhigh-flow oxygen and nothing placed in their mouths [45].\nRSV is a common and highly contagious viral illness in children affecting lungs\nand breathing passages, leading to bronchitis and pneumonia [47]. Assess for\ndehydration and treat airway/breathing problems [49].\nBronchiolitis is a viral illness often caused by RSV, affecting newborns and\ntoddlers, where bronchioles become inflamed, swell, and fill with mucus [50].\nOxygen therapy and frequent reassessment for respiratory distress are\nneeded [51].\nPneumonia is a lung infection, often secondary to an upper respiratory\ninfection that moves downward [52]. Bacterial pneumonia has a quick onset\nwith high fevers, while viral pneumonia is more gradual and less severe [54]. It\nespecially affects chronically or terminally ill people [57]. Fever is a key sign [58]\n. Airway support and supplemental oxygen are important [60].\nPertussis (whooping cough) is an airborne bacterial infection mostly affecting\nchildren under six, characterized by fever and a \"whoop\" sound on inspiration\nafter coughing [62]. It's highly contagious via droplets, and suctioning may be\nneeded [62].\nInfluenza Type A is an animal respiratory disease that mutated to infect\nhumans, transmitted via direct contact with nasal secretions and aerosolized\ndroplets [62]. Symptoms include high fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches,\nheadache, and fatigue, and it can lead to pneumonia or dehydration [64].\nCOVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) is a coronavirus transmitted through droplets,\nairborne particles, and direct contact [65]. It primarily affects the elderly, those\nin close quarters, and those with weakened immune systems, but young and\nhealthy adults can also be infected [66]. Symptoms include high fever, cough,\ninspirational chest pain, vomiting, diarrhea, and loss of smell, with rapid\nrespiratory deterioration possible [68].\nTuberculosis (TB) is a bacterial infection mainly affecting the lungs but can\nbe in other organs [70]. It can be inactive for years [70]. Symptoms include\nfever, cough, fatigue, night sweats, and weight loss [71]. It's more prevalent in\nhomeless individuals, prison inmates, nursing home residents, IV drug/alcohol\nabusers, and those with HIV [71]. Minimum PPE includes gloves, eye\nprotection, and an N95 respirator if TB is suspected [72].\n6. Other Respiratory Conditions: Pulmonary Edema and COPD\nPulmonary edema occurs when the left side of the heart cannot pump blood\nfrom the lungs effectively [72]. Fluid backs up in the alveoli and lung tissue [73].\nIt's usually a result of congestive heart failure (CHF), where the heart muscle\nis too weak to keep up with fluid [74].\nPatients often have dyspnea with rapid, shallow respirations [75].\nSevere cases may show frothy pink sputum from the mouth and nose [76].\nMost patients have a history of chronic CHF, but pulmonary edema can occur\nwithout heart disease [77].\nFluid in the alveoli interferes with oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange [77].\nChronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a lung disease with\nchronic, irreversible airflow obstruction [79].\nIt's an umbrella term including emphysema and chronic bronchitis [79].\nTobacco smoke often irritates the bronchial tubes, causing chronic bronchitis\n[79].\nChronic bronchitis involves ongoing irritation of the trachea and bronchi with\nconstant excessive mucus production [80]. This mucus obstructs small\nairways and alveoli [80].\nAirways are weakened, and protective lung mechanisms are destroyed [80].\nChronic oxygen problems can lead to right-sided heart failure and fluid\nretention [80].\nPneumonia can easily develop [80].\nRepeated irritation and pneumonia can scar the lungs [81].\nEmphysema is the loss of elasticity in lung material from chronic stretching of\nalveoli [81].\nSmoking directly destroys lung tissue elasticity [81].\nMost COPD patients have elements of both chronic bronchitis and\nemphysema [81].\nCOPD affects the alveoli, making gas exchange difficult [82].\nWet lung sounds (bronchi or crackles/rales) are associated with pulmonary\nedema (fluid) [83].\nDry lung sounds (wheezes) are associated with COPD [85].\nHowever, not all COPD patients will wheeze, and not all CHF patients will have\ncrackles; treat the patient, not just the lung sounds [87].\nLung Sound\nType\nCharacteristics Associated Condition(s)\nWet Lung\nSounds\nBronchi, Crackles,\nRales [83]\nPulmonary Edema [83], Congestive\nHeart Failure [83]\nDry Lung\nSounds\nWheezes [86] COPD [85]\n7. Allergic Reactions Affecting the Airway: Hay Fever, Asthma, and\nAnaphylaxis\nHay fever, asthma, and anaphylaxis are grouped together because they\nresult from allergic reactions (inhaled, ingested, or injected) [87].\nAsthma is an acute spasm of the bronchioles with excessive mucus\nproduction and swelling of the airway lining [88].\nIt affects all ages but is most prevalent in children aged 5-17 [88].\nAsthma produces characteristic wheezing as the patient exhales through\nnarrowed airways [89].\nAcute asthma attacks can be triggered by allergic reactions (food, allergens),\nemotional distress, exercise, or respiratory infection [90].\nIn its most severe form, an allergic reaction can cause anaphylaxis [91].\nHay fever causes cold-like symptoms: runny nose, sneezing, congestion, and\nsinus pressure [92]. Symptoms are from an allergic reaction to outdoor\nairborne allergens like pollen [92].\nAnaphylactic reactions are severe allergic reactions with severe airway\nswelling and widespread blood vessel dilation [93].\nThey may be associated with hives, itching, and signs of shock [93].\nLung sounds can be similar to asthma [93].\nAirway swelling can completely obstruct the airway [93].\nTreatment includes epinephrine, oxygen, and antihistamines [93].\n8. Other Respiratory Conditions: Pneumothorax, Pleural Effusion,\nand Airway Obstruction\nPneumothorax is the partial or total accumulation of air in the pleural space\n[94].\nIt is most often caused by trauma but can also result from medical conditions\n[95].\nA spontaneous pneumothorax occurs suddenly, sometimes in patients with\nchronic lung infections or young people with weak areas in the lungs [96].\nNormally, vacuum-like pressure in the pleural space keeps the lungs inflated\n[96]. When the lung surface is disrupted, air enters the pleural cavity, losing\nthe negative pressure [97].\nPatients with spontaneous pneumothorax become dyspneic and may\ncomplain of pleural or pleuritic chest pain [98].\nBreath sounds are absent or decreased on the affected side [98].\nPneumothorax has the potential to become life-threatening [98].\nPleural effusion is a collection of fluid around the lung [98].\nThis fluid compresses the lung and causes dyspnea [99].\nCauses include irritation, infection, chronic heart failure, or cancer [99].\nBreath sounds are decreased in the area of the effusion [99].\nPatients often feel better sitting upright [99].\nPatients with dyspnea may have a mechanical obstruction of the airway [100]\n.\nIn semi-conscious or unconscious patients, obstruction can be caused by\nvomit, foreign objects, improper head positioning, or the tongue falling back\n[101].\nIf a patient was eating before dyspnea onset, a foreign body airway\nobstruction should be considered [101].\n9. Other Respiratory Conditions: Pulmonary Emboli and\nHyperventilation\nA pulmonary embolus is anything in the circulatory system that travels and\nlodges, obstructing blood flow in the pulmonary area [103].\nCirculation can be partially or completely cut off [103].\nEmboli can be blood clot fragments or foreign bodies like air bubbles [104].\nA pulmonary embolus is a blood clot that travels through the venous system\nand right side of the heart to lodge in the pulmonary artery [105].\nSigns and symptoms include dyspnea, tachycardia (fast heart rate),\ntachypnea (fast breathing), varying hypoxia degrees, cyanosis, and acute\nchest pain [106].\nA large embolus can cause complete obstruction of blood output from the\nright heart, resulting in sudden death [107].\nHyperventilation is breathing excessively to the point that arterial carbon\ndioxide levels fall below normal [107].\nIt can indicate a life-threatening illness, possibly the body compensating for\nacidosis (acid buildup in blood/tissues) [108].\nIt can also result in alkalosis (abnormally low bloodstream volume/basic\nblood) [109].\nSigns and symptoms of hyperventilation syndrome, such as a panic attack,\ninclude anxiety, dizziness, numbness/tingling in hands/feet, and painful\nhand/foot spasms (carpal pedal spasm) [111].\nThe decision of whether hyperventilation is due to a life-threatening illness or\npanic attack should not be made outside the hospital [112].\n10. Environmental/Industrial Exposure and Carbon Monoxide\nPoisoning\nBreathing problems can be caused by environmental or industrial exposures\n[114].\nThis includes inhaling substances like pesticides, cleaning solutions,\nchemicals, and chlorine or other gases accidentally released [114].\nCarbon monoxide (CO) poisoning is caused by an odorless, highly\npoisonous gas [115].\nIt is the leading cause of accidental poisoning deaths in the US [115].\nCO is produced by fuel-burning household appliances and is present in smoke\n[115].\nSymptoms include flu-like complaints and dyspnea [116].\nIt is important not to put yourself at risk in these situations [116].\nHigh flow oxygen via a non-rebreathing mask is the best treatment for\nconscious patients with CO poisoning [116].\n11. Patient Assessment in Respiratory Emergencies\nScene size-up is crucial, always starting with assessing safety [116].\nUsing PPE is important, especially with infectious respiratory diseases and\ntoxic substances [116].\nIf multiple people have dyspnea, consider an airborne hazardous material\nrelease [117].\nDetermine the nature of illness by asking why 9-1-1 was called and\nquestioning the patient, family, or bystanders [118].\nThe primary assessment focuses on identifying immediate life threats [120].\nForm a general impression of the patient's distress level, noting age and\nposition [120].\nUse the AVPU scale (Alert, Verbal, Painful, Unresponsive) to check\nresponsiveness [120].\nAsk about the chief complaint [120].\nEvaluate the ABC's: ensure an open and adequate airway, assess breathing\nadequacy, and listen to lung sounds early [121].\nCheck breath sounds on both sides of the chest [122].\nAbnormal sounds include wheezing, rales, rhonchi, or stridor [122].\nFor circulation (C), assess pulse rate, rhythm, and quality, evaluate for shock\nor bleeding, and check perfusion (skin color, temp, condition) [123].\nMake a transport decision (load and go or stay and play) based on whether\nit's a life threat [125].\nTake a patient history, including history of the illness (investigating the chief\ncomplaint and what the patient has done for the problem) and history of the\npatient [126].\nUse the SAMPLE history (Signs/Symptoms, Allergies, Medications, Past\nMedical History, Last Oral Intake, Events Leading Up) for patients with a\nhistory of respiratory distress or if obtaining from bystanders/family [128].\nUse OPQRST (Onset, Provocation, Quality, Radiation, Severity, Time) to\ngather information about the breathing problem, similar to assessing pain [128]\n.\nPASTE (Progression, Associated chest pain, Sputum, Talking/Tiredness,\nExercise intolerance) is an alternative assessment for shortness of\nbreath/difficulty breathing [128].\nProceed with a secondary assessment only after addressing life threats and\nusing monitoring devices if available [128].\nAssessment Step Key Actions / Focus Areas\nScene Size-Up Ensure safety, use PPE, consider airborne hazards with\nmultiple patients [116]\nNature of Illness Determine why 9-1-1 was activated, question\npatient/family/bystanders [118]\nPrimary\nAssessment\nIdentify immediate life threats, general impression, level of\ndistress, age, position [120]\nResponsiveness Use AVPU scale [120]\nChief Complaint Ask the patient [120]\nAirway (A) Evaluate if open and adequate [121]\nBreathing (B) Assess adequacy, listen to lung sounds (early, both sides)\n[121]\nAbnormal Breath\nSounds\nWheezing, rales, rhonchi, stridor [122]\nCirculation (C) Assess pulse (rate, rhythm, quality), evaluate for\nshock/bleeding, check perfusion (skin color, temp,\ncondition) [123]\nTransport Decision\n(D)\nDetermine if life threat requires rapid transport (load and go)\n[125]\nHistory of Illness Investigate chief complaint, what patient has done for the\nproblem [126]\nHistory of Patient Use SAMPLE for history of respiratory distress,\nbystanders/family can provide info if patient can't talk [128]\nPresent Illness Use OPQRST or PASTE for information about the breathing\nproblem [128]\nSecondary\nAssessment\nConduct after addressing life threats, use monitoring\ndevices [128]\n12. Differentiating COPD and Congestive Heart Failure\nDifferentiating between COPD and Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) patients is\nimportant [129].\nCOPD patients are usually over 50 years old [130].\nThey often have a history of lung problems [131].\nMost are current or former long-term cigarette smokers [132].\nThey complain of chest tightness and constant fatigue [133].\nTheir chest may have a barrel-like appearance [134].\nThey often use accessory muscles to breathe [135].\nThey exhibit abnormal breath sounds [136].\nThey often exhale through pursed lips [136].\nThey may have digital clubbing, which are abnormally enlarged fingertips\n[136].\nCharacteristic COPD Patients Congestive Heart Failure\n(CHF) Patients\nAge Usually older than 50 [130] Not specified in this document\nsection\nHistory Often have lung problems [131]\n, long-term active or former\ncigarette smokers [132]\nNot specified in this document\nsection, but associated with\npulmonary edema [74]\nComplaints Tightness in chest, constant\nfatigue [133]\nDifficulty breathing, especially\nwhen lying flat [191]\nPhysical\nAppearance\nBarrel-like chest [134], digital\nclubbing (enlarged fingertips)\n[136]\nNot specified in this document\nsection\nBreathing\nPatterns\nOften use accessory muscles\n[135], often exhale through\npursed lips [136]\nRapid, shallow respirations\n(with pulmonary edema) [75]\nBreath Sounds Exhibit abnormal breath\nsounds [136]\nWet lung sounds (bronchi,\ncrackles, rales) often present\nwith pulmonary edema [83]\nOther Switch to hypoxic drive due to\nelevated CO2 levels [22]\nCan experience pulmonary\nedema [73]\n13. Management and Treatment of Respiratory Distress\nRepeat the primary assessment to check for changes in condition [138].\nConfirm that interventions are adequate [138].\nInterventions for respiratory problems include providing high flow oxygen (15\nliters via non-rebreather) [138].\nPositive pressure ventilations may be needed using a bag-valve mask, pocket\nmask, or flow-restricted, oxygen-powered device [138].\nAirway management techniques like oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal airway\ninsertion, suctioning, and positioning may be necessary [138].\nNon-invasive ventilatory support with CPAP might be provided [138].\nPosition the patient in a high Fowler's position or position of choice [139].\nAssist the patient with respiratory medications [139].\nCommunicate relevant information to the receiving facility staff [140].\nAdminister oxygen immediately for respiratory distress [141].\nProvide ventilatory support if the patient's mental status is declining, or if\ndistress is moderate/severe, or respiration depth is inadequate [141].\nMonitor the patient's respiratory status and provide emotional support [141].\nIf the patient has a metered-dose inhaler or small volume nebulizer, call\nmedical control to see if the medication is indicated [141].\nEnsure there are no contraindications for the medication [142].\nMost respiratory inhalation medicines relax muscles around air passages,\ncausing bronchial dilation (airway opening) [142].\nSide effects can include increased pulse, nervousness, and muscle tremors\n[142].\nMedication from an inhaler is delivered to the lungs via the respiratory tract\n[143].\nFollow skill drills for assisting patients with self-administration of inhalers and\nnebulizers [144].\n14. Treatment of Specific Respiratory Conditions\nFor upper or lower airway infections, administer humidified oxygen [145].\nDo not suction or place an OPA in a patient with suspected epiglottitis;\nposition comfortably and transport [146].\nFor pulmonary edema (fluid in lungs), provide 100% oxygen, suction if\nneeded, position comfortably (usually seated), provide CPAP if\nindicated/allowed, and transport promptly [148].\nFor COPD, assist with an inhaler, watching for overuse signs (side effects);\nposition comfortably and transport promptly [153].\nFor asthma, be ready to suction, assist with an inhaler, provide aggressive\nairway management, oxygen, and prompt transport [155].\nHay fever is usually not an emergency, manage the airway and give oxygen\nbased on distress level [157].\nAnaphylaxis is a true emergency; remove the offending agent, provide\naggressive airway management, oxygen, prompt transport, and administer Epi\nif allowed by protocol [158].\nFor spontaneous pneumothorax, provide oxygen, transport to the hospital,\nand monitor carefully [160].\nFor pleural effusions, fluid removal must be done at the hospital; provide\noxygen and transport promptly [161].\nFor airway obstruction: partial obstruction gets supplemental oxygen only;\ncomplete obstruction requires clearing the obstruction then administering\noxygen [162]. Transport rapidly to the emergency department [164].\nFor pulmonary emboli, supplemental oxygen is mandatory; position\ncomfortably; clear the airway immediately if coughing up blood; prompt\ntransport is needed [165].\nFor hyperventilation, complete primary assessment and gather history; never\nhave the patient breathe in a paper bag; reassure and provide oxygen if\nnecessary; prompt transport [167].\nFor environmental or industrial exposure, ensure patients are\ndecontaminated; treat with oxygen and adjuncts if needed; suction based on\npresentation [170].\nFor foreign body airway obstruction, perform age-specific clearing\ntechniques, provide oxygen, and transport [171].\nFor tracheostomy dysfunction, position comfortably, suction to clear\nobstruction, then oxygenate [172].\nFor asthma in children, give blow-by oxygen and use metered-dose inhalers\nas with older patients [173]. Asthma can be life-threatening in older adults [173].\nCystic fibrosis is a genetic disorder affecting lungs/digestive system,\npredisposing children to lung infections [174]. Symptoms vary; suction and\noxygenate these patients [174].\nCondition Treatment Approach\nUpper/Lower Airway\nInfection\nAdminister humidified oxygen [145]\nSuspected Epiglottitis Do not suction or place OPA, position comfortably,\ntransport [146]\nPulmonary Edema 100% oxygen, suction if needed, position\ncomfortably (seated), CPAP if indicated/allowed,\nprompt transport [148]\nCOPD Assist with inhaler (watch for overuse), position\ncomfortably, prompt transport [153]\nAsthma Prepare to suction, assist with inhaler, aggressive\nairway management, oxygen, prompt transport [155]\nHay Fever Manage airway, oxygen based on distress (usually\nnot emergency) [157]\nAnaphylaxis Remove agent, aggressive airway management,\noxygen, prompt transport, administer Epi (if protocol\nallows) [158]\nSpontaneous\nPneumothorax\nProvide oxygen, transport to hospital, monitor\ncarefully [160]\nPleural Effusions Provide oxygen, transport promptly (fluid removal at\nhospital) [161]\nPartial Airway Obstruction Provide supplemental oxygen [162]\nComplete Airway\nObstruction\nClear obstruction, administer oxygen, rapid\ntransport [162]\nPulmonary Emboli Mandatory supplemental oxygen, position\ncomfortably, clear airway if coughing blood, prompt\ntransport [165]\nHyperventilation Primary assessment, history, reassure, oxygen if\nnecessary, prompt transport (no paper bag) [167]\nEnvironmental/Industrial\nExposure\nDecontaminate, treat with oxygen/adjuncts, suction\nas needed [170]\nForeign Body Airway\nObstruction\nAge-specific clearing technique, oxygen, transport\n[171]\nTracheostomy Dysfunction Position comfortably, suction to clear obstruction,\noxygenate [172]\nAsthma in Children Blow-by oxygen, use MDI [173]\nCystic Fibrosis Suction, oxygenate [174]\n15. Review of Key Concepts\nThe process of oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange in the lungs is called\nrespiration [176]. Respiration is the exchange of gases between the body and\nits environment [176].\nAsthma is a respiratory disease causing obstruction of the lower airway\n(bronchioles) [177]. Croup and epiglottitis are upper airway infections [177].\nTuberculosis is a potentially drug-resistant bacterial infection transmitted by\ncoughing [178]. It is dangerous and resistant to antibiotics [179].\nCauses of acute dyspnea include asthma, pneumothorax, and pulmonary\nemboli [180]. Emphysema is a chronic respiratory disease, not an acute cause\nof dyspnea [182].\nBronchiospasm (narrowing/spasming of airways) is most often associated\nwith asthma [183]. Asthma is a reactive disease caused by bronchiole spasms\n[183].\nSudden onset of difficulty breathing with sharp chest pain and cyanosis\ndespite oxygen is indicative of a pulmonary embolus [184]. Pneumonia is\nslower, and MI can cause chest pain but this presentation is classic for emboli\n[184]. A pulmonary embolus is a blockage causing pleuritic chest pain [185].\nAlbuterol (a beta-2 antagonist/agonist) is the generic name for Ventolin or\nProventil [188].\nAn acute bacterial infection causing swelling of the flap covering the larynx\nduring swallowing (the epiglottis) is epiglottitis [189]. It is potentially lifethreatening\nand caused by bacterial infection of the epiglottis [190].\nDifficulty breathing, especially when lying flat, in a patient who recently had a\nheart attack suggests pulmonary edema from left-sided heart failure [191].\nLying flat allows fluid to cover more lung surface, while sitting up\nconcentrates it lower [192].\nA 29-year-old conscious and alert patient with 20 respirations is breathing\nadequately [194].",
