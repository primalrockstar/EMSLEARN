Review of Key Concepts A\n1. Introduction to Face and Neck Injuries\nThe face and neck are very vulnerable to injury [9].\nTheir position on the body is relatively unprotected [9].\nSoft tissue injuries and fractures are common [10].\nThese injuries can vary in severity [10].\nSome injuries are life-threatening [11].\nAn example is penetrating trauma to the neck [11].\nThis type of injury may cause severe bleeding [11].\nAn open injury may allow an air embolism to enter the circulatory system [11].\nUnderstanding the anatomy and physiology of these areas is important [12].\nThis report covers managing trauma related issues with the face and neck [2]\n.\nIt also helps in recognizing life threats associated with these emergencies [3].\nThe correlation with head and spinal trauma is also discussed [3].\n2.

Patient Assessment for Face and Neck Injuries\nScene safety is the highest priority in patient assessment [80].\nAssess for potential violence or environmental hazards [80].\nStandard precautions include eye protection and a face mask [81].\nThis is due to the potential for projectile blood [81].\nDetermine the number of patients and consider additional resources [82].\nThe mechanism of injury (MOI) is very important [83].\nAssess the scene for indicators of the MOI [84].\nCommon MOIs include motor vehicle collisions, sports falls, penetrating\ntrauma, and blunt trauma [85].\nThe primary assessment focuses on identifying life-threatening concerns\n[86].\nThreats to X, A, B, C's must be treated immediately [86].\nLife-threatening external hemorrhage should be addressed before airway\nand breathing [86].\nForm a general impression to gauge the patient's condition seriousness [87].\nInjuries may be obvious or hidden [88].\nControl blood loss with direct pressure [89].\nConsider the need for spinal immobilization [89].\nCheck responsiveness using the AVPU scale [89].\nEnsure a clear and patent airway [90].\nConsider an oral pharyngeal airway if the patient is unresponsive [91].\nQuickly assess the adequacy of breathing [92].\nSplinting or restricting chest wall motion is contraindicated [93].\nAssess the pulse and quality (Circulation) [95].\nSignificant bleeding is an immediate life threat [95].\nMake a transport decision (D) [96].\nQuickly transport patients with airway/breathing problems or significant\nbleeding [96].\nStabilization may be difficult [97].\nConsider advanced life support backup if transport is long [98].\nPatients with internal bleeding need rapid transport [99].\nSigns of hypoperfusion imply the need for rapid transport [100].\nPatients with a significant MOI appearing stable should also be transported\npromptly [101].\nA significant blow to the face or throat increases suspicion of spinal or brain\ninjury [102].\nEven without signs of hypoperfusion or other life-threatening injuries,\nsuspicion should be high [102].\nThere is a possibility of eye injuries [103].\nIn history taking, investigate the chief complaint and obtain medical history\n[103].\nBe alert for injury specific signs and symptoms [103].\nBe aware of pertinent negatives [103].\nGet a SAMPLE history [104].\nAttempt to gather history from friends or family if the patient is unresponsive\n[104].\nIn unresponsive patients, only signs of injuries are noticeable [105].\nFor the secondary assessment, if multiple systems are affected, start with an\nentire body assessment [105].\nLook for decap btls [105].\nDo not delay transport to complete a thorough physical exam in certain\npatients [105].\nConsider focusing the physical exam in responsive patients with isolated\ninjuries [106].\nEnsure control of bleeding is maintained [106].\nNote the location of the injury [106].\nInspect the wound for foreign matter and stabilize objects [107].\nUse both eyes and hands [108].\nExplain the examination process to a responsive patient [109].\nAssess all underlying systems [109].\nWhen evaluating the eyes, start with outer aspects and work towards the\npupils [110].\nvisual acuity is considered the vital sign of the eye [111].\nAssess and maintain baseline vital signs [112].\nObserve for any changes during treatment [112].\nBe concerned with visible and unseen bleeding [113].\nBaseline information about respirations and pulse is important [114].\nUse monitoring devices and perform reassessment [114].\nRepeat the primary assessment, reassess vital signs and chief complaint [115].\nContinually reassess the adequacy of airway, breathing, and circulation [115].\nRecheck patient interventions [116].\nReassessment is particularly important in facial/neck injuries [116].\nPatient condition should be reassessed at least every 5 minutes [116].\n5. Emergency Medical Care for Face and Neck Injuries\nInjury Type Key Emergency Care Interventions Source\nGeneral Care Complete spinal immobilization if suspected\nspinal injuries; Maintain open airway; Prepare to\nsuction; Consider oral/nasal airway; Provide\nhigh-flow oxygen; Control significant visual\nbleeding; Treat for shock if hypoperfusion\nsigns; Rapid transport if seriously injured.\n[117]\nSoft Tissue\nInjuries\nAssess X ABC's and life threats first; Follow\nstandard precautions; Open and clear airway\n(avoid neck movement if cervical injury\nsuspected); Control bleeding with direct\npressure and sterile dressing; Do not apply\nexcessive pressure if skull fracture suspected;\nCover exposed structures with moist sterile\ndressing; Apply ice to injuries that do not break\nskin; Check for bleeding inside the mouth; Save\navulsed skin wrapped in sterile dressing and\nkeep cool; Place loose skin flaps close to\nnormal position.\n[123]\nEye - Foreign\nObjects\nIrrigate with sterile saline solution; For objects\non the eyelid, remove with a moist, cottontipped\napplicator; For impaled objects, stabilize\nand transport, bandage both eyes.\n[137]\nEye - Burns Stop the burn and prevent further damage; For\nchemical burns, flush with water or sterile\nsolution continuously (20+ mins for strong\nacids/alkaloids); Apply clean dry dressing and\ncover eye; For thermal burns, cover both eyes\nwith sterile dressing moistened with saline; For\nlight burns, cover each eye with sterile moist\npad and eye shield.\n[143]\nEye - Lacerations If globe laceration, apply no pressure; Gently\napply moist sterile dressing; Cover with a\nprotective metal shield, cup, or sterile dressing;\nApply soft dressing to both eyes; If eyeball\ndislodged, do not reposition, cover and\nstabilize with moist sterile dressing, cover both\neyes, keep patient supine.\n[156]\nEye - Blunt\nTrauma\nProtect injured eye with metal shield; Cover the\nother eye to minimize movement.\n[164]\nEye - Blast\nInjuries\nManagement depends on severity.\n[169]\nEye - Contact\nLenses/Artificial\nEyes\nGenerally do not remove (except chemical\nburns); Remove hard lenses with suction cup;\nRemove soft lenses by pinching gently after\nadding saline; Place lenses in saline and advise\nhospital; Care for artificial eye like a normal one.\n[171]\nNosebleeds\n(Epistaxis)\nFor non-trauma patient bleeding heavily, place\nin sitting position leaning forward and pinch\nnostrils; For trauma-related bleeding, apply\nsterile dressing.\n[183]\nEar Injuries Apply local pressure to control bleeding; If\nsevere ear avulsion, wrap avulsed part in moist\nsterile dressing, place in labeled plastic bag; Do\nnot remove foreign objects from the ear canal;\nDo not try to manipulate foreign bodies.\n[187]\nFacial Fractures Remove and save loose teeth or bone\nfragments from the mouth; Remove loose\ndentures and dental bridges to protect airway;\nSwelling can be a source of obstruction.\n[196]\nDental Injuries Apply direct pressure to stop bleeding from\ndisplaced teeth; Perform suctioning if needed;\nSave and transport avulsed tooth by the crown;\nPlace tooth in storage solution, milk, or sterile\nsaline.\n[200]\nCheek Injuries If unable to control bleeding compromising\nairway, consider removing the object; Provide\ndirect pressure on both sides (inside and out);\nBandaging should not occlude the mouth.\n[202]\nNeck Injuries\n(Blunt Trauma)\nMaintain airway; Immediately transport;\nConsider advanced life support early; Consider\nspinal motion restriction.\n[207]\nNeck Injuries\n(Penetrating\nTrauma)\nDirect pressure over the bleeding site; Assess\nfor signs of shock; Immediate spinal motion\nrestriction if indicated; Apply high-flow oxygen;\nDo not remove penetrating or impaled objects\nunless interfering with CPR; Stabilize all\nimpaled objects if not obstructing airway.\n[213]\nLaryngeal\nInjuries\nMaintain airway; Immediately transport;\nConsider advanced life support early; Consider\nspinal motion restriction; Do not remove\npenetrating or impaled objects unless\ninterfering with CPR; Stabilize impaled objects\nif not obstructing airway; Provide oxygen and\n[207]\nventilate; Keep patient supine; Avoid use of a\nrigid collar.\n6. Complications and Considerations\nInjuries to the face and neck can frequently cause airway obstruction [65].\nSeveral factors can contribute to this obstruction [65].\nThese include blood clots from heavy facial bleeding [66].\nDirect injuries to the nose, mouth, larynx, and trachea can cause bleeding\nand respiratory compromise [66].\nDislodged teeth or dentures can become an airway obstruction [67].\nSwelling from soft tissue injury can also cause obstruction [68].\nAirway can be affected by turning the patient's head [69].\nBrain and cervical spine injuries may interfere with normal respirations [69].\nFacial fractures also carry the danger of blood clots obstructing the airway\n[195].\nSwelling can be extreme within 24 hours after injury [198].\nA life-threatening complication is an air embolism [11].\nThis may result from an open injury allowing air into the circulatory system\n[12].\nIt can occur if a vein has been punctured in the neck [211].\nRapid transport is crucial for certain patients [96].\nThis includes patients with airway or breathing problems or significant\nbleeding [96].\nPatients with internal bleeding must be transported quickly [99].\nSigns of hypoperfusion imply the need for rapid transport [100].\nEven patients appearing stable but with a significant MOI should be\ntransported promptly [101].\nAdvanced life support (ALS) should be considered [98].\nThis is important if transport is too long [98].\nConsider ALS early for neck injuries [208].\n7.
