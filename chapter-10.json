It provides a\nstructured approach to evaluating patients [2]. This process is divided into five main\nparts [7].\nThe five main parts are:\nscene size-up [7]\nprimary assessment [7]\nhistory taking [7]\nsecondary assessment [7]\nreassessment [7]\nThe order of these steps can vary depending on the patient's condition and\nenvironment [8].\nRarely does a single sign or symptom reveal the patient's full status or\nunderlying problem [10].\nA symptom is what the patient feels and tells you (subjective) [11].\nA sign is what you can observe or measure (objective) [11].\nPart Description\nScene Size-Up Evaluating the operating conditions [7]\nPrimary Assessment Identifying and treating immediate life threats [7]\nHistory Taking Gathering details about the chief complaint and patient\nhistory [7]\nSecondary\nAssessment\nPerforming a systematic physical exam [7]\nReassessment Identifying and treating changes in the patient's condition\n[7]\n2. Scene Size-Up\nscene size-up is evaluating the conditions for operation [13]. situational awareness is\nvital throughout the call [14]. Dispatch provides initial information [15].\nscene size-up combines information and observations for safe operations [16].\nEnsuring scene safety is critical [17].\nPre-hospital settings can present minor or major dangers [18].\nIf a scene is unsafe, make it safe or call for additional resources [19].\nConsider traffic safety and environmental conditions [20].\nProtect bystanders from becoming patients [22].\nHazards can include environmental, physical, chemical, electrical, water, fire,\nexplosions, and physical violence [23].\nBe aware of potential violence from patients, family, bystanders, gangs, or\ncrowds [24].\nEmergency scenes are dynamic environments [25].\nDetermine the mechanism of injury (moi) or nature of illness (NOI) [26].\nCalls can be medical, trauma, or both [27].\nTraumatic injuries result from physical force [27].\nMOI terms include blunt trauma and penetrating trauma [29].\nFor medical patients, determine the NOI [30].\nGather information from the patient, family, or bystanders [31].\nUse your senses for clues [31].\nBe aware of multiple patients with similar symptoms (e.g., carbon monoxide)\n[32]. This may indicate an unsafe scene [32].\nMOI or NOI is valuable for preparing patient care [33].\nTake standard precautions [34].\nAdapt PPE to the pre-hospital task [35].\nstandard precautions are CDC-recommended measures for dealing with\nblood, body fluids, non-intact skin, and mucous membranes [36].\nAssume all these pose an infection risk [37].\nInitiate standard precautions before patient contact [38].\nAt minimum, wear gloves before contact [39].\nConsider glasses and a mask [40].\nDetermine the number of patients [41].\nAccurately identify the total number of patients [41].\nUse the incident command system with multiple patients [42].\nBegin triage with multiple patients [42].\ntriage sorts patients based on condition severity [43].\nConsider additional resources [44].\nThis could include more ambulances, police, helicopters, or fire trucks [44].\nAdvanced life support or air medical may be needed [45].\nFire departments handle hazmat, technical rescue, extrication, or water\nrescue [46].\nLaw enforcement may be required [47].\nQuestions for determining additional resources:\nDoes the scene threaten you or the patient? [48]\nHow many patients are there? [48]\nDo you have resources for their conditions? [48]\n3. Primary Assessment\nThe primary assessment's goal is to identify and treat immediate life threats [49]. This\ninvolves physically examining the patient [49]. You assess level of consciousness,\nairway, breathing, and circulation [49].\nForm a general impression first [50].\nThis helps determine priority of care [50].\nNote age, sex, race, distress level, and overall appearance [50].\nEnsure the patient sees you approaching [51].\nNote patient position and movement [51].\nAvoid standing over the patient [52].\nAddress the patient by name and introduce yourself [53].\nAsk about the chief complaint [53].\nThe patient's response offers insight into consciousness, airway,\nbreathing, and circulation [54].\nTreat life-threatening problems immediately [55].\nDefine the patient's condition as stable, stable but potentially unstable, or\nunstable [56].\nScan for and control uncontrolled external bleeding [56]. This takes priority\n[56].\nAssess the level of consciousness (loc) [57].\nLOC indicates neurologic and physiologic status [57].\nAssessment of an unconscious patient focuses on ABCs [58].\nSustained unconsciousness suggests a critical respiratory, circulatory, or\nCNS problem [58].\nAltered LOC in conscious patients may be due to inadequate perfusion,\nmedication, drugs, alcohol, or poisoning [59].\nUse the AVPU mnemonic for responsiveness [60]. Choose one description\n[60].\nTest patients not responding to verbal stimuli for response to painful\nstimulus [60].\nPainful stimuli include pinching the arm, skin, or trap area [61]. Also apply\nupward pressure along the orbital ring [62].\nA patient moaning or withdrawing responds to stimulus [62].\nOrient and test mental status by checking memory and thinking [63].\nEvaluate ability to remember: Person (name), Place (location), Time (year,\nmonth, date), and Event (what's happening) [64].\nAnswering all is being alert and oriented times four (A&Ox4) [64].\nAny deviation from A&Ox4 or baseline is altered mental status [65].\nIdentify and treat life threats [66].\nConditions causing sudden death are life threats [66].\nExamples include airway obstruction, respiratory failure/arrest, shock,\nsevere bleeding, or cardiac arrest [66].\nUsually, address life threats with ABC (Airway, Breathing, Circulation) [67].\nSometimes, CAB (Circulation, Airway, Breathing) is more appropriate [68].\nAssess the Airway (A) [69].\nStay alert for airway obstruction [70].\nEnsure the airway remains patent and adequate [71].\nResponsive patients talking or crying have an open airway [71].\nA conscious patient who cannot speak or cry likely has a severe\nobstruction [72].\nIf an airway problem is found, stop assessment and clear it [73].\nIf the patient has difficulty breathing and is not breathing, take immediate\ncorrective actions [73].\nAssess airway patency in unresponsive patients [74].\nUse the jaw thrust maneuver for potential trauma to open the airway [75].\nIf jaw thrust doesn't work or trauma is ruled out, use the head tilt chin lift\nmaneuver [76].\nSigns of obstruction in an unconscious patient: obvious trauma, blood,\nobstruction, noisy breathing (snoring, bubbling, gurgling, crowing, stridor),\nextremely shallow or absent breathing [76].\nAssess Breathing (B) [77].\nEnsure the patient's breathing is present and adequate after ensuring a\npatent airway [77].\nAsk: Is the patient breathing? Is it adequate? Is the patient hypoxic? [79].\nPerform positive pressure ventilation for patients not breathing, or whose\nbreathing is too slow or shallow [79].\nIf breathing is adequate but hypoxic, administer oxygen [80].\nOxygenation goal for most patients is 94-99% saturation [81].\nIf difficulty breathing develops after primary assessment, re-evaluate the\nairway immediately [82].\nConsider positive pressure ventilations with an airway adjunct when\nrespirations exceed 28, are fewer than 8, or are too shallow for adequate\nexchange [83].\nShallow respirations show little chest wall movement [83].\nObserve effort required for breathing [83]. Look for retractions, accessory\nmuscle use, nasal flaring [83].\nNote two-to-three word dyspnea (shortness of breath when talking) [83].\nLook for the tripod position (sitting up and leaning forward) or labored\nbreathing [84].\nrespiratory distress is increased effort and rate [85].\nrespiratory failure is inadequate oxygenation or ventilation [85].\nrespiratory failure can lead to respiratory arrest if uncorrected [86].\nAssess Circulation (C) [87].\nEvaluate by assessing mental status, pulse, and skin condition [87].\nThese are the three parts of circulation assessment [88].\nAssess the pulse [89]. Palpate if a pulse is present [89].\nResponsive patients older than one year: palpate radial pulse at the wrist\n[90].\nUnresponsive patients older than one year: palpate carotid pulse at the\nneck [91].\nChildren under one year: palpate brachial pulse in the upper arm [91].\nIf a pulse cannot be palpated in an unresponsive patient, start CPR [92].\nAssess skin condition for perfusion [93]. Evaluate skin color, temperature,\ncondition, and capillary refill [94].\nSkin color: Pale, white, ashen, or gray indicates poor peripheral circulation\n[95]. Abnormally flushed or red can indicate high blood pressure [96]. Blue\nindicates low oxygen saturation (cyanosis) [96].\nSkin temperature: Normal is warm [97]. Abnormal is hot, cold, cool, or\nclammy [98].\nMoisture: Normal is dry [99]. Wet, moist, or excessively dry/hot suggests a\nproblem [99].\ncapillary refill is evaluated in pediatric patients [100]. It assesses circulation\nto capillary beds in fingers and toes [100].\nCap refill should restore within two seconds [101].\nTest by gently pushing a fingertip until it blanches white [101]. Release and\ncount how long it takes for the pink color to return [102]. Should be less\nthan two seconds [102].\nAssess and control any external bleeding [103]. This should occur before\naddressing airway or breathing [103].\nBleeding from a large vein is a steady flow [104].\nBleeding from an artery is characterized by spurting [104].\nControl bleeding by applying direct pressure [105].\nIf direct pressure fails or there is obvious arterial hemorrhage, apply a\ntourniquet [105].\nPerform a rapid scan to identify life threats [106].\nIdentify injuries needing management or protection before transport [106].\nThis is a 60-90 second exam [106].\nIt is not a systematic or focused physical exam [106].\nDetermine patient priority and transport (D) [107]. This follows ABC [107].\nHigh-priority patients include those who are unresponsive, have difficulty\nbreathing, or uncontrolled bleeding [108].\nOther high-priority conditions: altered LOC, severe chest pain, pale\nskin/poor perfusion signs, complicated childbirth, or severe pain [108].\nLoad and go for high-priority patients [108].\nThe golden hour (or Golden Period) is the time from injury to definitive\ncare [109]. Treatment of shock and traumatic injuries must occur then to\nmaximize survival [109].\nImmediate transport is key for patients needing care the EMT cannot\nprovide [109].\nThe timeline: Discovery/EMS activation (first 20 minutes), platinum 10\nminutes (initial assessment, intervention, packaging, getting off scene),\nEMS transport/hospital stabilization [110].\nTransport decisions are made at this point [111].\nDecisions are based on patient condition, availability of advanced care,\ntransport distance, and local protocols [112].\nStep Action\nGeneral Impression Note age, sex, race, distress, appearance; determine care\npriority [50]\nAssess LOC (AVPU) Use AVPU to determine responsiveness; check orientation\n(Person, Place, Time, Event) [60]\nIdentify Life Threats Recognize conditions causing sudden death (airway,\nbreathing, circulation, bleeding) [66]\nAirway Assessment Ensure patent airway; check for obstruction signs; use\nmaneuvers if needed [70]\nBreathing\nAssessment\nCheck presence and adequacy; assess rate, rhythm,\nquality, depth; administer oxygen/ventilate [77]\nCirculation\nAssessment\nAssess mental status, pulse, skin condition; control external\nbleeding [87]\nRapid Scan Quickly identify any other life threats [106]\nPriority/Transport Determine patient priority (high priority conditions); decide\non transport [107]\n4. History Taking\nhistory taking is the next part of patient assessment [113]. It includes the patient's\nhistory and the history of the present illness [113]. This provides details about the\nchief complaint and symptoms [114].\nDocument the date, patient age, gender, race, medical history, and current\nhealth status [114].\nInvestigate the chief complaint and history of the present illness [115].\nBegin by introducing yourself and making the patient comfortable [115]. Obtain\npermission to treat [115].\nAsk simple, direct questions [116]. Use Mr., Miss, or Mrs. with the patient's last\nname [116].\nUse open-ended questions to determine the chief complaint [116].\nUse eye contact to encourage the patient to speak [116]. Repeat statements to\nshow understanding [116].\nIf the patient is unresponsive, get information from family or bystanders [117].\nLook for medical alert jewelry or documentation [119].\nUse the OPQRST mnemonic to gather information on the present illness [121].\nOnset: When the problem started [122].\nProvocation: What makes the problem better or worse? [123]\nQuality: How would you describe the feeling (pain, stabbing, pressure)?\n[124]\nRegion/Radiation: Where the problem is and if it spreads [124].\nSeverity: On a scale of 0-10, how bad is the pain? [124]\nTiming: When did it start? Is it constant or intermittent? [124]\nIdentify pertinent negatives: negative findings that don't require care or\nintervention [121].\nObtain the SAMPLE history [125].\nSigns and symptoms [125].\nAllergies [125].\nMedications [125].\nPast pertinent medical history [125].\nLast oral intake [125].\nEvents leading up to the illness or injury [125].\nOPQRST is for the present illness, SAMPLE is for the patient history [125].\nCritical thinking is essential in assessment [126].\nGather facts for clinical decision making [126].\nEvaluate what the information means [126].\nSynthesize information into a plan for managing the scene/patient care\n[126].\nTaking history on sensitive topics requires a professional approach [127].\nAlcohol or drugs: Signs can be confused or hidden [127]. Patients may\ndeny problems [127]. History from dependent patients may be unreliable\n[128]. Do not judge [129].\nPhysical abuse or violence: Report all abuse/domestic violence to\nauthorities [130]. Follow state laws and local protocols [131]. Do not accuse;\ninvolve law enforcement immediately [132]. This is mandatory reporting\n[133].\nSexual history: May be sensitive [133]. Consider all female patients of\nchildbearing age with lower abdominal pain pregnant until ruled out [134].\nAsk about last menstrual period [135]. Inquire about urinary symptoms with\nmale patients [135]. Ask about potential STDs when appropriate [135].\nSpecial challenges in history taking [136].\nSilence: Patience is important [137]. Closed-ended questions (yes/no) may\nwork best [138]. Consider if silence is a clue to the chief complaint [138].\nOverly talkative patients: Reasons can include caffeine, nervousness,\ndrug use (crack, cocaine, methamphetamines), or physiological issues [139]\n.\nMultiple symptoms: Prioritize complaints like in triage [140]. Start with the\nmost serious [140].\nAnxiety: Recognize it may be a sign of a serious medical condition [141].\nCommon in disaster scenes [142]. Anxious patients may show signs of\nshock (pale, sweating, shortness of breath, numbness/ tingling, dizziness,\nloss of consciousness) [143]. Anxiety can indicate low blood sugar, shock,\nor hypoxia [143].\nAnger and hostility: Family or bystanders may direct anger at you [145].\nRemain calm, reassuring, and gentle [145]. Retreat if the scene is unsafe\nuntil secured [146].\nIntoxication: Do not corner an intoxicated patient [147]. Potential for\nviolence is high [147]. Alcohol dulls senses [148].\nCrying: A patient may be sad, in pain, or overwhelmed [149]. Remain calm,\npatient, reassuring, and confident [150]. Maintain a soft voice [150].\nDepression: A leading cause of disability [151]. Symptoms include sadness,\nhopelessness, restlessness, irritability, sleeping/eating disorders,\ndecreased energy [152]. Being a good listener is effective [153].\nLimited cognitive abilities: Keep questions simple; limit medical terms\n[154]. Be alert for partial answers; keep asking questions [155]. Rely on\nfamily, caregivers, or friends for answers with severely limited cognitive\nfunction [156].\nCultural challenges: Don't use medical language [157]. Some cultures\nprefer same-gender healthcare providers [158]. Gain assistance from\nfriends, family, or same-culture providers if possible [158].\nLanguage barriers: Find an interpreter if possible [159]. Determine if the\npatient understands who you are [159]. Keep questions straightforward and\nbrief [160]. Use hand signals or gestures if needed [160]. Be aware of\ncommunity language diversity [161].\nHearing problems: Ask slowly and clearly [162]. Use a stethoscope as a\nhearing aid [162]. Learn simple sign language or use paper/pencil [163].\nVisual impairments: Identify yourself verbally upon entering [164]. Return\nmoved items to their previous position [165]. Explain each step of\nassessment and vital signs [165]. Notify the patient before lifting or moving\nthem [166].\n5. Secondary Assessment\nThe secondary assessment is the fourth section [168]. If the patient is stable and has\nan isolated complaint, perform it at the scene [169]. If not, perform it in the ambulance\nen route to the hospital [169].\nSometimes, there isn't time for a secondary assessment [171]. Continue\nmanaging life threats during transport [171].\nThe purpose is to perform a systematic physical exam [172].\nThis may be a focused assessment based on the chief complaint or a certain\nbody area/system [172].\nHow to assess during the physical exam: inspect, palpate, auscultate, and\npercuss [172]. Look, listen, and feel [172].\nInspect: Look at the patient for abnormalities [173].\nPalpate: Feel for abnormalities [174].\nAuscultate: Listen with a stethoscope [174].\nThe mnemonic DCAP-BTLS helps remember what to look for in trauma\nassessments [175].\nCompare findings on one side of the body to the other [176].\nDeformities [177]\nContusions [177]\nAbrasions [177]\nPunctures or penetrations [177]\nBurns [177]\nTenderness [177]\nLaceration [177]\nSwelling [177]\nThe systematic assessment's goal is to identify hidden injuries [178].\nPerform a focused assessment on patients with non-significant MOIs or\nmedical patients [180]. It is typically based on the chief complaint [180].\nFocus attention on the affected body part or system [180].\nRespiratory system focus (for difficulty breathing) [181]:\nExpose and inspect the chest for obstruction signs or trauma [182].\nInspect chest symmetry (both sides rising/falling) [183].\nAuscultate and listen to breath sounds, noting abnormalities [184].\nMeasure respiratory rate, chest rise/fall (tidal volume), and effort [184].\nLook for retractions and increased work of breathing [185].\nObtain RRQ (respiratory rate, rhythm, quality, depth) [187].\nNormal adult rate is 12-20 breaths/minute [188]. Children breathe faster\n[189]. Count breaths in 30 seconds and multiply by two [189].\nRespiratory rhythm should be regular or irregular [190]. Regular means\nconsistent time between chest rises [190]. Irregular can indicate an\nunderlying medical or trauma condition [191].\nQuality of breathing: Normal is silent [192]. Other sounds (advantageous\nbreath sounds) indicate respiratory problems [192].\nDepth of breathing: Amount of air exchanged, depends on tidal rate\nand volume [193].\nAuscultate breath sounds on both sides and multiple lung fields [193].\nListen for: Normal, snoring (upper respiratory), wheezing (lower),\ncrackles (lower), rhonchi (lower), stridor (upper) [194].\nCardiovascular system focus (for chest pain) [198]:\nLook for trauma to the chest; listen for breath sounds [198].\nConsider pulse, respiratory rate, and blood pressure [199].\nPay attention to rate, quality, and rhythm of the pulse [199].\nConsider skin findings [200].\nCheck and compare distal pulses for differences [201].\nConsider auscultation for abnormal heart tones [201].\nPulse: Normal adult resting pulse is 60-100 [202]. Younger patients have\nfaster rates [203].\nAssess pulse RRQ (rate, rhythm, quality) [204].\nPulse quality: Strong or bounding [205]. Weak or thready is difficult to\nfeel [205].\nPulse rhythm: Regular or irregular [206]. Regular has consistent intervals\n[206]. Irregular means early or late beats or missed beats [208].\nTake blood pressure [209]. It's the pressure against artery walls [209].\nLow blood pressure (hypotension) can indicate blood/fluid loss, loss of\nvascular tone, or cardiac problems [209]. It is a late sign of shock [210].\nHigh blood pressure (hypertension) can result in rupture or damage\n[210].\nBlood pressure cuff components: wide upper cuff, inflatable bladder,\nbulb pump/valve, pressure gauge [212].\nAuscultation is a common way to measure BP [213].\nPalpation (feeling) can be used in certain cases (blood pressure by\npalp) [214].\nNeurologic system focus (for mental status changes, head injury, stupor,\ndizziness, drowsiness, syncope) [216]:\nEvaluate level of consciousness and orientation using AVPU or\nGlasgow Coma Scale (GCS) [216]. GCS provides info on mental status\nchanges [218].\nAssess pupils [219]. Normally round, equal size, and adjust to light [219].\nPupil size and reactivity reflect brain status, perfusion, oxygenation,\nand condition [220].\nPupils dilate in the absence of light [221].\nUnequal pupils (anisocoria) can indicate altered brain function, though\na small population has unequal pupils normally [222].\nUse the PEARL mnemonic: Pupils Equal And Round, Regular in size,\nand Reactive to Light [222].\nAssess neurovascular status with a hands-on assessment [223].\nDetermine sensory and motor response [223].\nLook for bilateral muscle strength and weakness [223].\nComplete a thorough sensory assessment [224]. Test for pain sensation\nand position [224].\nCompare distal and proximal sensory and motor responses side to side\n[224].\nFor trauma situations, perform the DCAP-BTLS assessment on all body\nregions [226].\nHead, neck, and cervical spine: palpate, check eyes, cheekbones, ears\n(look for fluid), maxilla, mandible, mouth (broken teeth, odors) [227].\nChest: look, listen, and feel [227].\nAbdomen: palpate for tenderness, rigidity, guarding [228]. Palpate the four\nquadrants (left upper/lower, right upper/lower) [228].\nPelvis: inspect for symmetry [229].\nExtremities: check for DCAP-BTLS, pulses, motor, and sensory function\n[229].\nRoll the patient (often onto a backboard) [230]. Inspect the back for DCAPBTLS,\nsymmetry, open wounds [231]. Palpate the spine from neck to pelvis\nfor tenderness or deformity [232].\nComponent Focus\nSystematic\nExam\nInspect, palpate, auscultate, percuss [172]\nFocused\nAssessment\nBased on chief complaint or affected system (e.g., respiratory,\ncardiovascular, neurologic) [172]\nTrauma\nAssessment\nDCAP-BTLS on all body regions (Head, Neck, Spine, Chest,\nAbdomen, Pelvis, Extremities, Back) [175]\nVital Signs Pulse, Respiratory Rate, Blood Pressure, Skin (Color, Temp,\nCondition), Capillary Refill, using devices (Pulse Ox,\nCapnography) [234]\n6. Vital Signs and Reassessment\nAssessing vital signs is the next area [234]. Use appropriate monitoring devices, but\nthey don't replace a comprehensive assessment [235].\nMonitoring devices:\nPulse oximetry: Evaluates oxygenation effectiveness; measures oxygen\nsaturation [235]. Patients with difficulty breathing should get oxygen\nregardless of pulse ox reading [235].\nCapnography: Provides information on patient ventilation, circulation, and\nmetabolism [236].\nBlood glucose/glucometry: Measures blood sugar level [237].\nNBP (Non-invasive blood pressure) measurement [237].\nreassessment is the very last part [238].\nPerform reassessment at regular intervals [238].\nPurpose: Identify and treat changes in the patient's condition [238].\nSteps in reassessment:\nRepeat the primary assessment [238].\nReassess vital signs [238]. Compare baseline vitals to subsequent ones\nto look for trends (e.g., BP changes, heart rate changes) [238].\nReassess the chief complaint [238].\nRecheck interventions [238].\nDocument any changes and whether they were positive or negative [239].\nIdentify and treat the patient's condition [239].\nReassess unstable patients every five minutes [240]. It is a continuous process\n[241].",
