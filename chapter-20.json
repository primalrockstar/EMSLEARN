Introduction to Endocrine and Hematologic Emergencies\nThis report covers endocrine and hematologic emergencies from Chapter\n20 [1].\nUnderstanding these conditions is crucial for emergency care and\ntransportation of the sick and injured [1].\nThe report aims to explain the significance and characteristics of diabetes,\nsickle cell disease, and clotting disorders [2].\nIt will also detail the assessment and pre-hospital treatment for these\nemergencies [4].\nThe endocrine system profoundly influences nearly every cell, organ, and\nfunction of the body [6].\nendocrine disorders often present with a variety of signs and symptoms [6].\nhematologic emergencies can be challenging to assess and treat in the prehospital\nsetting [7].\n2. Anatomy and Physiology of the Endocrine System and Glucose\nMetabolism\nThe endocrine system serves as a communication system within the body [8]\n.\nendocrine glands secrete messenger hormones that travel through the blood\n[8].\nThese hormones affect specific target organs, tissues, or cells [8].\nendocrine disorders arise from internal communication problems [9].\nA gland may overproduce hormones (hypersecretion) or underproduce\nthem (hyposecretion) [10].\nSometimes the gland functions correctly, but the receiving organ does not\nrespond [11].\nGlucose metabolism is vital, as the brain needs glucose and oxygen to\nsurvive [11].\ninsulin is necessary for glucose to enter cells [12].\ninsulin acts like a key unlocking the door for glucose [13].\nWithout sufficient insulin, cells do not receive energy [14].\nThe pancreas produces and stores two key hormones: glucagon and insulin\n[15].\nThe islets of Langerhans in the pancreas contain alpha and beta cells [16].\nAlpha cells produce glucagon [18].\nBeta cells produce insulin [18].\nThe pancreas secretes insulin and glucagon based on blood glucose levels\n[19].\nEndocrine\nGland/Component\nKey Hormones\nProduced\nPrimary Function\nRelated to Glucose\nSource\nPancreas Glucagon, Insulin Regulates blood\nglucose levels\n[15]\nIslets of Langerhans Glucagon (Alpha\ncells), Insulin (Beta\ncells)\nProduction site for\nglucagon and\ninsulin\n[16]\n3. Diabetes Mellitus: Pathophysiology, Types, and Complications\nDiabetes mellitus is a disorder of glucose metabolism [19].\nThe body has an impaired ability to get glucose into cells for energy [19].\nUntreated diabetes leads to high blood glucose levels [20].\nSevere cases can cause life-threatening illness, coma, or death [21].\nPoorly managed diabetes can lead to severe complications [22].\nThese include blindness, cardiovascular disease, and kidney failure [22].\nThere are three main types of diabetes [23].\ndiabetes mellitus type 1 [23].\ndiabetes mellitus type 2 [23].\ngestational diabetes (pregnancy-induced) [23].\nDiabetes treatments involve medications and injectable hormones [24].\nThese treatments lower blood glucose levels [24].\nIncorrect administration can create a medical emergency [24].\nhypoglycemia (low blood glucose) is life-threatening if untreated [25].\nhyperglycemia (high blood glucose) can result in coma or death [26].\nExcessive treatment (e.g., too much insulin) can cause life-threatening\nhypoglycemia [26].\nBoth hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia can occur in Type 1 and Type 2\ndiabetes [27].\nPatients often display signs and symptoms of high and low blood glucose [28].\nhyperglycemia and hypoglycemia can have similar presentations [29].\nPatients may have altered mental status and mimic alcohol intoxication [30].\nCharacteristic Diabetes Mellitus\nType 1\nDiabetes Mellitus Type 2 Source\nCause Autoimmune\ndestruction of\npancreatic beta\ncells\nResistance to insulin\neffects at cellular level\n[34]\nInsulin\nProduction\nPancreas produces\nlittle to no insulin\nPancreas produces insulin,\nbut cells don't respond\neffectively\n[34]\nOnset Usually early\nchildhood through\nfourth decade\nOften diagnosed at yearly\nmedical exam or from\ncomplaints\n[35]\nTreatment Requires external\ninsulin source\n(injections, pump)\nDietary modification,\nexercise, oral medications,\ninjectable medications,\ninsulin\n[35]\nCommon\nComplication\nDiabetic\nKetoacidosis (DKA)\nHyperosmolar\nHyperglycemic Nonketotic\nSyndrome (HHNS)\n[48]\n4. Hypoglycemia: Causes, Signs, Symptoms, and Management\nhypoglycemia is low blood sugar [31].\nIt can develop if a person takes medication but doesn't eat enough food [32].\nTaking too much medication can also result in low blood glucose levels [32].\nCommon reasons for low blood sugar include:\nCorrect insulin dose with a change in routine or more insulin than normal\n[75].\nCorrect insulin dose without the patient eating [75].\nCorrect insulin dose and the patient developing an acute illness [75].\nAll hypoglycemic patients require prompt transport [32].\nSigns and symptoms of hypoglycemia include:\nNormal to shallow or rapid respirations [75].\nPale, moist skin; diaphoresis [75].\nDizziness, headache [75].\nRapid pulse or normal to low blood pressure [75].\nAltered mental status [75].\nAnxious or combative behavior [75].\nSeizures, fainting, or coma [75].\nWeakness on one side of the body (may mimic a stroke) [75].\nRapid changes in mental status [75].\nhypoglycemia is quickly reversed by giving the patient glucose [76].\nWithout glucose, the patient can sustain permanent brain damage [77].\n5. Diabetes Mellitus Type 1: Characteristics and Diabetic\nKetoacidosis (DKA)\ndiabetes mellitus type 1 is an autoimmune disorder [34].\nThe immune system attacks pancreatic beta cells that produce insulin [34].\nMissing insulin means glucose cannot enter cells [34].\nThe pancreas does not produce its own insulin in Type 1 diabetes [34].\nOnset usually occurs from early childhood through the fourth decade [35].\nPatients with Type 1 diabetes cannot survive without external insulin [35].\nMany patients use an implanted insulin pump [36].\nThese pumps continuously measure glucose and provide insulin [37].\nThey can malfunction, leading to diabetic emergencies [39].\nAlways ask about the presence of an insulin pump [39].\nType 1 diabetes is the most common metabolic disease of childhood [40].\nNew onset Type 1 diabetes symptoms relate to eating and drinking [41].\npolyuria (increased urination) [41].\npolydipsia (increased thirst) [41].\npolyphagia (increased hunger) [41].\nWeight loss and fatigue [41].\nNormal blood glucose is between 80 and 120 mg/dL [42].\nWhen blood glucose is high, the kidneys' filtration system is overwhelmed [43].\nGlucose then spills into the urine [43].\nIf glucose is unavailable, the body burns fat for energy [44].\nBurning fat produces acid waste called ketones [44].\nKetone levels rise in the blood and spill into the urine [45].\nKidneys cannot maintain acid-base balance with high glucose and ketones\n[46].\nPatients breathe faster and deeper to release carbon dioxide and reduce acid\n[47].\nThis breathing pattern is known as kussmaul respirations [47].\nContinued fat metabolism and ketone production can cause diabetic\nketoacidosis (dka) [48].\nDKA is a life-threatening illness [48].\nDKA may present as generalized illness [49].\nSymptoms include abdominal pain, body aches, nausea, and vomiting [50].\nAltered mental status or unconsciousness can occur in severe DKA [50].\nDKA can result in death if not rapidly recognized and treated [51].\nBlood glucose in DKA is generally higher than 400 mg/dL [52].\nSigns and\nSymptoms\nDiabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA) Source\nRespirations Rapid and deep (Kussmaul respirations)\n[47]\nBreath Odor Sweet, fruity (acetone-like)\n[89]\nGeneral Presentation Generalized illness, abdominal pain, body\naches\n[49]\nGastrointestinal Nausea, vomiting\n[50]\nMental Status Altered mental status, unconsciousness\n(severe)\n[50]\nBlood Glucose Generally higher than 400 mg/dL\n[52]\nUrination/Thirst Polyuria, Polydipsia (especially new onset)\n[41]\n6. Diabetes Mellitus Type 2: Characteristics and Hyperosmolar\nHyperglycemic Nonketotic Syndrome (HHNS)\ndiabetes mellitus type 2 is caused by cellular resistance to insulin [53].\nObesity predisposes patients to Type 2 diabetes [54].\nThe pancreas produces insulin, but cells and receptors are dysfunctional [55].\ninsulin resistance can improve with exercise and dietary modification [56].\nTreatment includes oral medications [57].\nSome increase insulin secretion, posing a hypoglycemia risk [57].\nOthers stimulate insulin receptors or decrease glucagon effects [57].\nInjectable medications and insulin are also used for Type 2 diabetes [58].\nType 2 diabetes is often diagnosed at a yearly medical exam [58].\nComplaints relate to high blood glucose levels [58].\nThese include recurrent infections, vision changes, or foot numbness [59].\nSymptomatic hyperglycemia occurs with very high blood glucose [60].\nPatients have altered mental status due to combined problems [60].\nContrast with Type 1 diabetes:\nType 1 leads to ketoacidosis and dehydration from urination [62].\nType 2 leads to a non-ketotic state of dehydration [63].\nFluid is discharged from body systems and kidneys, causing imbalance [63]\n.\nLong-term hyperglycemia can cause complications [64].\nWounds that don't heal, numbness in hands/feet, blindness, renal failure\n[64].\nGastric motility problems [64].\nUncontrolled Type 2 diabetes can lead to hyperosmolar hyperglycemic\nnonketotic syndrome (hhns) [65].\nHHNS key signs and symptoms include:\nhyperglycemia [65].\nAltered mental status, drowsiness, lethargy [65].\nSevere dehydration, thirst, dark urine [65].\nVisual and sensory defects, partial paralysis, muscle weakness [66].\nSeizures [66].\nHigh blood glucose causes glucose excretion into urine [66].\nPatients increase fluid intake, causing polyuria [66].\nIn HHNS, patients cannot drink enough to keep up with high glucose levels [67]\n.\nUrine becomes dark and concentrated [68].\nSevere dehydration can lead to unconsciousness or seizure activity [69].\n7. Patient Assessment for Diabetic Emergencies\nBegin with scene size-up [78].\nBe cautious of syringes used for insulin [78].\nLook for clues like syringes, insulin bottles, food, or orange juice [79].\nUse standard precautions [80].\nQuestion bystanders about events leading to your arrival [80].\nConsider that trauma may also have occurred [80].\nDetermine the mechanism of injury (MOI) or nature of illness (NOI) [81].\nPerform a primary assessment [82].\nGet a general impression of the patient [82].\nIdentify threats and provide life-saving interventions, especially airway\nmanagement [83].\nDetermine the level of consciousness using the AVPU scale (Alert, Verbal,\nPainful, Unresponsive) [84].\nIf unresponsive and you suspect diabetes, call for Advanced Life Support\n(ALS) [85].\nPatients may have undiagnosed diabetes [85].\nAssess blood glucose levels in patients with altered mental status [85].\nPerform cervical spine immobilization if necessary [86].\nProvide rapid transport [86].\nAssess the patient's breathing [87].\nPatients with inadequate breathing, a pulse ox less than 94, or altered mental\nstatus need high flow oxygen (12-15 L/min via non-rebreather) [88].\nHyperglycemic patients may have rapid, deep (Kussmaul) respirations and\nsweet, fruity breath [89].\nHypoglycemic patients may have normal, shallow, or rapid respirations [90].\nIf the patient isn't breathing well, open the airway, insert an adjunct,\nadminister oxygen, and assist ventilations [91].\nMonitor ventilations throughout care [91].\nAssess circulation (the \"C\") [92].\nHyperglycemic patients often have dry, warm skin [92].\nHypoglycemic patients often have moist, pale skin [92].\nA rapid, weak pulse can indicate symptomatic hypoglycemia [93].\nMake a transport decision (the \"D\") [94].\nTransport patients with altered mental status and impaired swallowing [95].\nConscious patients who can swallow may be evaluated on scene [96].\nPerform history taking [97].\nInvestigate the chief complaint and obtain the history of the present illness\nusing OPQRST [97].\nObtain the patient's history [97].\nIf the patient ate but didn't take insulin, hyperglycemia is more likely [97].\nObtain a SAMPLE history [98].\nFor known diabetics, ask about insulin/pills, insulin pump use, insulin/pill dose\ntaken, food intake, illness, unusual activity, or stress [99].\nLook for emergency medical identification tags (wallet card, necklace,\nbracelet) [99].\nConduct a secondary assessment [100].\nFor nature of illness, focus on a neurological assessment [100].\nAssess non-responsive patients head-to-toe for clues and secondary injuries\nlike trauma [100].\nWhen diabetes is suspected, focus on mental status, ability to swallow, and\nairway protection [100].\nObtain a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score [100].\nObtain vital signs, including blood glucose level if possible [100].\nhypoglycemia vital signs: normal to rapid respirations, weak and rapid pulse,\npale and clammy skin, low blood sugar [101].\nhyperglycemia vital signs: rapid (maybe deep and rapid) respirations, rapid,\nweak, thready pulse, warm and dry skin, normal blood pressure [102].\nUse a portable glucometer if available and protocol allows [103].\nKnow the glucometer's operating ranges [104].\nNormal non-fasting adult/child blood glucose: 80-120 mg/dL [104].\nNeonate glucose should be above 70 mg/dL [104].\nAssessment\nStep\nKey Actions and Findings Source\nScene Size-\nUp\nBe aware of syringes; Look for clues (insulin, food);\nUse standard precautions; Question bystanders;\nConsider trauma; Determine MOI/NOI\n[78]\nPrimary\nAssessment\nGeneral impression; Identify threats; Airway\nmanagement; Determine LOC (AVPU); Call ALS for\nunresponsive suspected diabetics; Assess blood\nglucose (if training allows); C-spine immobilization\n(if needed); Rapid transport for altered mental\nstatus/impaired swallowing\n[82]\nBreathing\nAssessment\nAssess respirations; High flow oxygen for\ninadequate breathing, SpO2<94%, altered mental\nstatus; Kussmaul respirations/fruity breath\n(hyperglycemia); Normal/shallow/rapid respirations\n(hypoglycemia); Open airway, adjuncts, assist\nventilations if needed\n[87]\nCirculation\nAssessment\nAssess skin (warm/dry for hyperglycemia,\npale/moist for hypoglycemia); Assess pulse\n(rapid/weak for symptomatic hypoglycemia)\n[92]\nHistory\nTaking\nInvestigate chief complaint (OPQRST); Patient\nhistory (eating/insulin status); SAMPLE history; Ask\nspecific diabetes questions; Look for medical ID tag\n[97]\nSecondary\nAssessment\nPhysical exam (focus on neuro); Head-to-toe for\nunresponsive; Focus on mental status, swallowing,\nairway protection for suspected diabetes; GCS\nscore\n[100]\nVital Signs Blood glucose level (glucometer); Hypoglycemia\n(rapid/weak pulse, pale/clammy skin);\nHyperglycemia (rapid/weak/thready pulse,\nwarm/dry skin)\n[100]\n8. Emergency Medical Care for Diabetic Emergencies\nReassess diabetic patients frequently [105].\nAssess changes in mental status and ABCs [106].\nEvaluate response to interventions [106].\nAdjust interventions based on glucose administration, readings, or\ndeteriorating consciousness [106].\nFor conscious hypoglycemic patients who can swallow [107]:\nEncourage glucose tablets or juice containing sugar [107].\nUse glucose gel or sugar drink if local protocol allows [108].\nProvide rapid transport for unconscious hypoglycemic patients [109].\nAlso transport patients with risk of aspiration (cannot maintain airway) [109].\nThese patients may need IV glucose, IM shot, or intranasal glucagon [110].\nMost EMTs cannot give glucagon [111].\nIf unsure if the patient is hyperglycemic or hypoglycemic, err on the side of\ngiving sugar [112].\nDetermining blood glucose can be hard if signs are confusing and you can't\ntest [113].\nPerform a thorough assessment in these cases [114].\nContact the hospital to help sort out signs and symptoms [114].\nCoordinate communication and documentation [114].\nPatients refusing transport after symptoms improve with oral glucose need\nthorough documentation [114].\nOral glucose preparations are available [115].\nRapidly dissolving gel [115].\nLarge chewable tablets [115].\nLiquid formulation [115].\nContraindications for oral glucose: inability to swallow and patient being\nunconscious [116].\nWear gloves before putting anything in a patient's mouth [117].\nFollow local protocols for glucose administration [118].\nReassess frequently and transport [118].\nhypoglycemia is a possible cause of seizures [119].\nSeizures may indicate a life-threatening underlying condition [120].\nManagement of seizures:\nMaintain the airway [121].\nPlace the patient on their side if no cervical spine trauma [121].\nDo not place anything in the mouth [121].\nHave suction ready if the patient vomits [121].\nProvide oxygen or artificial ventilations if cyanotic or breathing\ninadequately [121].\nTransport promptly [121].\nAltered mental status may be caused by complications like hypoglycemia or\nketoacidosis [122].\nUse the mnemonic AEIOU TIPS for altered mental status [122].\nAlways suspect and check blood glucose in patients with altered mental\nstatus [122].\nManagement of altered mental status:\nEnsure the airway is clear [123].\nBe prepared to provide artificial ventilations [123].\nBe prepared to suction if they vomit [123].\nProvide transport promptly [123].\nDiabetic emergencies can be misdiagnosed as neurological dysfunction or\nintoxication [124].\nAn emergency medical identification (bracelet, necklace, card) can be lifesaving\n[125].\nA blood glucose test can identify the real problem [126].\nBe alert for diabetes and alcoholism coexisting [126].\nRegarding airway management:\nDiabetic patients may not have a gag reflex and vomit [127].\nThe tongue may obstruct the airway [127].\nCarefully monitor the airway [128].\nPlace the patient in the lateral recumbent position [128].\nEnsure suction is readily available [128].\n9. Introduction to Hematologic Emergencies\nNow transitioning from endocrine to hematologic emergencies [129].\nHematology is the study of blood-related diseases [130].\nThree disorders can create pre-hospital emergencies [131].\nsickle cell disease [131].\nhemophilia [131].\nthrombophilia [131].\nanemia is also discussed [131].\n10. Anatomy and Physiology of Blood\nBlood consists of four main components [133].\nerythrocytes (red blood cells) [133].\nleukocytes (white blood cells) [133].\nplatelets [133].\nPlasma [133].\nEach component contributes to maintaining the body's hemostatic balance\n[134].\nRed blood cells contain hemoglobin [134].\nThey carry oxygen to the tissues [134].\nWhite blood cells respond to infection [135].\nThey collect dead cells and manage their disposal [135].\nplatelets are essential for clotting [136].\nPlasma serves as the transport medium for blood components, proteins, and\nminerals [137].\nBlood Component Function Source\nErythrocytes (Red\nBlood Cells)\nContain hemoglobin, carry oxygen to\ntissues\n[133]\nLeukocytes (White\nBlood Cells)\nRespond to infection, collect dead cells\n[133]\nPlatelets Essential for clotting\n[133]\nPlasma Transport medium for blood components,\nproteins, minerals\n[133]\n11. Sickle Cell Disease: Pathophysiology, Complications, and\nAssessment\nsickle cell disease, or hemoglobin s disease, is an inherited blood disorder\n[138].\nIt primarily affects red blood cells [138].\nIt is predominantly found in people of African, Caribbean, or South American\nancestry [138].\nPatients have misshapen red blood cells (sickle-shaped) [138].\nSickled cells lead to dysfunction in oxygen binding [138].\nThey also cause unintentional clot formation [138].\nSickle cells have a short lifespan, resulting in more cellular waste [139].\nThis waste contributes to sludging or clumping of blood [139].\nMaintaining hydration is important [139].\nInsufficient hydration increases blood clumping [139].\nComplications of sickle cell disease include:\nanemia, gallstones, jaundice, and spleen dysfunction [140].\nVascular occlusion with ischemia [141].\nAcute chest syndrome, strokes, joint necrosis, pain crisis [141].\nAcute or chronic organ dysfunction or failure, retinal hemorrhages [141].\nIncreased risk of infections [141].\nMany complications are very painful and potentially life-threatening [142].\nPatients are more susceptible to infections [143].\nAssessment findings in sickle cell crisis:\nIncreased respirations or signs of pneumonia [167].\nIncreased heart rate [170].\nSwelling of fingers and toes, priapism, or jaundice [173].\nPain (isolated or throughout the body) [174].\nVisual disturbances [174].\nNausea, vomiting, abdominal cramping [174].\nChest pain or shortness of breath [174].\nVital signs may be normal to rapid respirations, weak rapid pulse, pale\nclammy skin, or low blood pressure [177].\n12. Clotting Disorders: Hemophilia and Thrombophilia\nClotting disorders affect the blood's ability to clot properly [144].\nhemophilia is a rare disorder [145].\nOnly about 20,000 Americans have this disorder [145].\nhemophilia A affects mostly males [146].\nPeople with hemophilia A have a decreased ability to create a clot after injury\n[147].\nThis decreased ability can be life-threatening [147].\nPatients can be prescribed medications to replace missing clotting factors\n[148].\nMedications can also prevent the breakdown of blood clots [148].\nCommon complications of hemophilia A include:\nLong-term joint problems (may need joint replacements) [149].\nBleeding in the brain [149].\nThrombosis due to treatment [149].\nthrombophilia is a disorder of the blood's ability to flow smoothly [150].\nIt affects the venous and arterial systems [150].\nConcentrations of blood elements create clogging or blockage issues [151].\nthrombophilia is a general term for conditions causing blood to clot more\neasily [152].\nIt can be an inherited or genetic disorder [152].\nOther causes include medications, other factors, or cancer [152].\nClots can develop spontaneously in the blood [153].\n13. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Causes, Risk Factors, and\nTreatment\ndeep vein thrombosis (dvt) is a common medical problem [154].\nIt occurs in sedentary patients and those with recent injury or surgery [154].\nMethods to prevent blood clot formation include:\nBlood thinning medications [154].\nCompression stockings [154].\nMechanical devices [154].\nRisk factors for DVT include:\nRecent history of some type of replacement [155].\nComplications of leg swelling [155].\nRemaining sedentary for long periods [155].\nTreatment for DVTs includes anticoagulation therapy [156].\nOral medications are typically given for at least three months [157].\nA clot from a DVT may travel from the leg to the lung [157].\nThis causes a pulmonary emboli [158].\n14. Anemia: Causes and Impact on Oxygen Delivery\nanemia is an abnormally low number of red blood cells [159].\nCauses include chronic or acute bleeding [160].\nDeficiency in certain vitamins or minerals can cause anemia [160].\nAn underlying disease process may also be responsible [160].\nanemia impairs the blood's ability to deliver adequate oxygen to tissues [160].\nPulse oximetry may show inadequate saturation [160].\nThis can happen even if underlying tissues are hypoxic [160].\n15. Patient Assessment for Hematologic Emergencies\nBegin with scene size-up [161].\nEnsure scene safety [161].\nMost sickle cell patients have experienced a crisis before [162].\nWear gloves and eye protection at a minimum [163].\nDetermine the number of patients involved [163].\nBe alert for possible trauma [164].\nConsider advanced life support (ALS) [164].\nPerform a primary assessment [165].\nPerform cervical immobilization if needed [165].\nForm the general impression [165].\nProceed to the ABCs [165].\nFor inadequate breathing or altered mental status, give high flow oxygen (12-\n15 L via non-rebreather) [166].\nSickle cell crisis patients may have increased respirations or pneumonia signs\n[167].\nFor difficulty breathing, open the airway, insert adjuncts, administer oxygen,\nand assist ventilations if needed [168].\nAssess the patient's circulatory status [169].\nSickle cell crisis patients will have increased heart rate [170].\nThis helps force sickled cells through smaller vessels [170].\nFor suspected hemophilia, be alert for signs of blood loss [170].\nNote bleeding of unknown origin [170].\nBe alert for signs of hypoxia due to blood loss [170].\nMake the transport decision (the \"D\") [171].\nRapid transport to the emergency room is recommended for any patient\nexperiencing a sickle cell crisis or hemophilia [171].\nPerform history taking [172].\nInvestigate the chief complaint [172].\nObtain history of the present illness from responsive patients, family, or\nbystanders [172].\nBe alert for signs of sickle cell crisis [173].\nSwelling of fingers/toes, priapism, jaundice [173].\nAsk specific questions:\nIs pain isolated or throughout the body? [174].\nAny visual disturbances? [174].\nExperiencing nausea, vomiting, or abdominal cramping? [174].\nExperiencing chest pain or shortness of breath? [174].\nObtain a SAMPLE history from responsive patients or family [175].\nAsk if they've had a crisis before, when the last one was, and how it resolved\n[175].\nAsk about recent illnesses, unusual activity, or stress [175].\nConduct a secondary assessment [175].\nSystematically examine the patient, focusing on the joints [175].\nEvaluate and document the mental status [175].\nObtain a complete set of vital signs, including oxygen saturation [176].\nNormal sickle cell crisis vital signs: normal to rapid respirations, weak rapid\npulse, pale clammy skin, or low blood pressure [177].\nUse pulse ox to monitor oxygen saturation [178].\nReadings may be inaccurate in anemic patients [178].\nAssessment\nStep\nKey Actions and Findings Source\nScene Size-\nUp\nEnsure safety; Be aware of prior crises; Wear\ngloves/eye protection; Determine patient number;\nConsider trauma; Consider ALS\n[161]\nPrimary\nAssessment\nC-spine immobilization (if needed); General\nimpression; ABCs; High flow oxygen for inadequate\nbreathing/altered mental status; Assess respirations\n(increased in sickle cell crisis); Open airway,\nadjuncts, assist ventilations if needed; Assess\ncirculation (increased heart rate in sickle cell crisis);\nBe alert for blood loss/hypoxia in hemophilia; Rapid\ntransport for sickle cell crisis/hemophilia\n[165]\nHistory\nTaking\nInvestigate chief complaint; Obtain history of\npresent illness; Be alert for sickle cell crisis signs\n(swelling, priapism, jaundice); Ask about pain,\nvision, GI symptoms, chest pain/SOB; Obtain\n[172]\nSAMPLE history (crisis history, recent\nillness/activity/stress)\nSecondary\nAssessment\nSystemic exam (focus on joints);\nEvaluate/document mental status; Obtain vital signs\n(including SpO2)\n[175]\nVital Signs Respirations (normal to rapid); Pulse (weak rapid);\nSkin (pale clammy); Blood Pressure (low); Pulse ox\n(may be inaccurate in anemia)\n[177]\n16. Emergency Medical Care for Hematologic Emergencies\nReassess vital signs frequently to track changes in the patient's condition\n[179].\nEvaluate the effectiveness of interventions performed [180].\nCommunicate with hospital staff for continuity of care [180].\nDocument clearly all findings and care provided [180].\nEmergency care for hematologic emergencies is mainly supportive and\nsymptomatic [182].\nFor patients with inadequate breathing or altered mental status, provide high\nflow oxygen (12-15 L/min) [182].\nPlace the patient in a position of comfort [182].\nTransport rapidly to the hospital [182].\n17. Review Questions and Conclusion\nThis concludes Chapter 20 on endocrine and hematologic emergencies [183].\nReview questions help assess understanding of the material [183].\nType 1 diabetes impairs glucose utilization because cells lack insulin [184].\nIn a patient with Type 1 diabetes found unresponsive, asking if they took\ninsulin is most important [186].\nDehydration in a diabetic patient with high blood glucose is due to the kidneys\nexcreting glucose and water [187].\nSkipping a meal but still taking insulin would most likely cause a hypoglycemic\ncrisis [188].\nFor an unresponsive diabetic patient, the first action is to open the airway [191]\n.\nkussmaul respirations (rapid and deep) are typical in diabetic ketoacidosis\n(dka) [193].\nExcessive urination, thirst, hunger, altered mental status, and fast breathing in\na child suggest a hyperglycemic crisis (DKA) [195].\nIf cells don't receive glucose, they metabolize fat [198].\nFat metabolism results in keto acids [199].\nCompared to a hyperglycemic crisis, a hypoglycemic crisis usually responds\nimmediately to treatment with sugar [200].\nPatients with DKA experience polydipsia (thirst) because they are dehydrated\nfrom excessive urination [202].",
