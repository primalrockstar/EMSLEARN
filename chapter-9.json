Introduction to the Team Approach in Healthcare\nThe team approach to healthcare is significant. [2]\nIt impacts positive patient outcomes. [2]\nAs an EMT, you are a critical member of this team. [4]\nThe team includes first responders, paramedics, and other EMTs. [5]\nIt also involves physicians, nurses, and other personnel. [5]\nThey help the patient throughout their illness or injury. [5]\nA key goal is inherently safe EMS systems. [6]\nThese systems minimize exposure to injury and infection. [6]\nThe culture of safety involves data collection and resources. [7]\nIt also includes EMS education and safety standards. [7]\nReporting and investigating errors is part of this culture. [7]\nPrevious models had providers working separately. [9]\nThey passed the patient from one individual to the next. [9]\nWorking as a uniform team improves performance. [10]\nThis includes first patient contact to discharge. [10]\nPatient safety and outcomes are also improved. [10]\n2. Types of Healthcare Teams\nThere are different types of teams. [14]\nYou have regular teams and temporary teams. [15]\nRegular teams consist of EMTs. [16]\nThey constantly interact with the same partner. [16]\nThey are more likely to move smoothly through procedures. [17]\nTemporary teams work with providers they don't regularly interact with.\n[17]\nProviders must work collaboratively. [17]\nSpecial teams are another type. [19]\nThese include fire teams and rescue teams. [19]\nHazmat and tactical teams are examples. [19]\nSpecial event EMS teams and bike teams exist. [19]\nIn-hospital patient care techs and MIH technicians are included. [19]\nThere is a difference between groups and teams. [20]\nNIMS defines a group by functional level of operation. [21]\nGroups perform special functions. [22]\nA group consists of independent healthcare providers. [23]\nThey work independently to help the patient. [23]\nExamples are triage, transport, or treatment groups. [23]\nA team is a group of providers with specific roles. [24]\nThey work interdependently under a leader. [24]\nEssential elements of a group include a common goal. [24]\nThey have an image of themselves as a group. [24]\nThey have a sense of community and shared values. [24]\nThere are different roles within the group. [24]\nThere are dependent, independent, and interdependent groups. [25]\nIn dependent groups, individuals are told what and how to do things. [25]\nThis is done by their supervisor or leader. [25]\nIn independent groups, each individual is responsible for their area. [26]\nIn interdependent groups, everyone works together. [26]\nThey have shared responsibilities and accountability. [27]\nThey work towards a common goal. [27]\n2. Types of Healthcare Teams\nTeam Type Characteristics Interaction\nFrequency\nRegular Teams EMTs work consistently with the same\npartner. [16]\nFrequent and\nconsistent. [16]\nTemporary\nTeams\nEMTs work with providers they don't\nregularly interact with or know. [17]\nInfrequent or initial.\n[17]\n3. Essential Elements for Effective Team Performance\nEffective team performance requires a shared goal. [28]\nEvery provider must be committed to the goal. [28]\nClear roles and responsibilities are needed. [29]\nEach provider must know their tasks and expectations. [29]\nA diverse and competent skill set is important. [30]\nTeam members should practice together. [30]\nThey should be familiar with each other's tools and techniques. [30]\nEffective collaboration and communication are vital. [31]\nTeam communication includes clear messages. [31]\nClosed-loop communication is an element. [31]\nCourtesy and constructive intervention are also important. [31]\nSupportive and coordinated leadership is necessary. [32]\nThe team leader assigns roles and provides oversight. [33]\nThey offer centralized decision making. [33]\nLeaders support the team to achieve goals. [33]\nTeam leaders foster communication and dynamics. [34]\nThey use concepts like crew resource management (crm). [34]\nTeam situational awareness is also used. [34]\nCRM helps teams develop a shared understanding. [36]\nIt is a way for team members to work together. [36]\nCRM recommends using the pace mnemonic. [36]\nPACE stands for Probe, Alert, Challenge, Emergency. [37]\n4. Patient Care Transfer and Collaboration\nPatient care is transferred at several points. [38]\nThis transfer is also called handing off care. [38]\nThese transfers can introduce critical errors. [39]\nErrors are possible especially with multiple transfers. [39]\nEffective teams minimize the number of transfers. [40]\nThey adhere to strict guidelines for transfers. [40]\nVerbal transfer of care should ensure uninterrupted critical care. [41]\nThere should be minimal interference. [41]\nRespectful interaction is important. [41]\nTeams should have common priorities. [41]\nCommon language systems should be used. [41]\nBasic life support efforts must continue. [43]\nThis continues throughout the continuum of care. [43]\nEfforts must be coordinated with advanced life support. [44]\nAdvanced providers use advanced tools and techniques. [44]\nA paramedic-only skill in one system might be an EMT skill in another. [45]\nIt is your responsibility to understand your scope of practice. [46]\nStandard of care and local protocols are also important. [46]\n5. Decision Making and Conflict Resolution in Teams\nEffective decisions are based on sound knowledge. [48]\nInformation comes from the patient and history. [48]\nPhysical examination also provides information. [48]\nThere are stages in the decision-making process. [49]\nThese stages include pre-arrival, arrival, during the call, and after the call. [49]\nDecision making begins with initial dispatch information. [49]\nMentally rehearse needed care steps. [49]\nDesignate a leader in the pre-arrival stage. [49]\nCrew members discuss their roles. [49]\nOn arrival, provide a scene size-up. [50]\nRequest additional resources if needed. [50]\nAssess and intervene for life threats immediately. [50]\nDuring the call, the team leader gathers information. [51]\nThey interpret the data and develop a plan. [51]\nThe plan is communicated to the team. [51]\nThe plan is then implemented. [51]\nEvaluate the effect of the decision. [51]\nAfter the call, debrief and talk about what happened. [52]\nListen to feedback with an open mind. [53]\nThere are decision traps in critical thinking. [54]\nThese traps frequently lead to errors. [55]\ndecision traps include bias, anchoring, and overconfidence. [55]\nbiases are fixed beliefs about something. [56]\nanchoring occurs when one cause is settled on early. [56]\nOther options are then not considered. [56]\noverconfidence happens when abilities are overestimated. [56]\nWhen conflict occurs, use five techniques. [57]\nThe patient comes first. [57]\nDo not engage in the conflict. [57]\nKeep your cool. [57]\nSeparate the person from the issue. [57]\nChoose your battles wisely. [57]\n6. Review of Key Concepts\nA characteristic of a regular team is consistent interaction with the same\npartner. [59]\nThis allows them to perform as a seamless unit. [59]\nEssential elements of a group include shared goals. [61]\nIt is important for groups to have a set of shared goals. [61]\nMembers of an interdependent group work together. [62]\nThey have shared responsibilities and accountability. [62]\nThey work towards a common goal. [62]\nRepeating a message back to a team member is closed-loop communication.\n[64]\nA clear message is delivered calmly and concisely. [65]\nThe listener repeats it back. [65]\nA team leader is essential for team success. [66]\nWhen verbal transfer of care occurs, ensure team members are respectful.\n[68]\nIn a conflict scenario with a tired partner, it's suggested to go ahead and\ndiscuss it after. [70]",
