Includes other\nadvanced assessment and treatment skills [23].\nTraining may be in an associate's or bachelor's\ndegree program [65].\n4. Components of the EMS System\nThe EMS Agenda 2050 outlines five components of the EMS system [68].\nThese components include comprehensive, quality and convenient care [69].\nEvidence-based clinical care is another component [69].\nEfficient, well-rounded care is also included [69].\nPreventative care is a key part [69].\nComprehensive and easily accessible patient records are essential [69].\nPublic access ensures easy access to help in an emergency [70].\nThe 911 system is part of public safety [71].\nAn emergency medical dispatch (EMD) system helps dispatchers give\nmedical instructions [72].\nMobile apps can alert lay people trained in CPR to cardiac arrests [73].\nHuman resources focuses on the people who deliver care [74].\nThe EMS Agenda 2050 encourages an environment where talented people\nwant to work [75].\nMedical direction is provided by a physician [76].\nThe medical director authorizes EMTs to provide care in the field [76].\nmedical directors are liaisons between the medical community and EMTs [77].\nAppropriate care is described in standing orders and protocols [77].\nprotocols are a comprehensive guide for the EMT's scope of practice [78].\nstanding orders are part of protocols [78].\nThey designate what the EMT must do for a specific complaint [78].\nProviders do not need to consult medical direction before implementing\nstanding orders [79].\nMedical control can be offline (indirect) or online (direct) [80].\nOffline control involves standing orders, training, or supervision [80].\nOnline control is a physician's direct order over the phone or radio [81].\nLegislation and regulation ensure training, protocols, and practices follow\nstate laws [82].\nA senior EMS official manages administrative tasks and daily operations [83].\nIntegration of healthcare services means pre-hospital care continues in the\nemergency department [84].\nMobile integrated healthcare (MIH) uses the pre-hospital spectrum for\nhealthcare delivery [85].\nMIH evolved to improve access to affordable healthcare [85].\nHealthcare in the MIH model is provided in the community [86].\nThis is done by an integrated team of professionals [86].\nThis branch uses additional training levels for EMS providers [87].\nThis includes community paramedicine [88].\nExperienced paramedics receive advanced training for community services\n[88].\nThey can perform health evaluations and monitor chronic illnesses [89].\nThey can obtain lab samples and administer immunizations [89].\nInformation systems use computer systems to document patient care [90].\nElectronically stored information is used to improve care [90].\nEvaluation means the medical director is responsible for quality control [91].\nAdopting a just culture promotes fairness and accountability [92].\ncontinuous quality improvement (cqi) reviews and audits the EMS system\n[93].\nCQI identifies areas for improvement and assigns remedial training [94].\nMinimizing errors is the goal of CQI [95].\nIt uses a plan, do, study, act cycle [95].\nPatient safety involves minimizing medical errors [95].\nThis requires efforts from both the EMS agency and personnel [96].\nSystem finance varies depending on the organization [97].\nPersonnel can be paid, volunteer, or a mix [98].\nEMTs may gather insurance information or secure signatures on hipaa notices\n[99].\nThey may obtain permission to bill health insurance [99].\nThe ET3 pilot program reimburses EMS for appropriate patient care [100].\nIt sets up payment for transport to alternative destinations [101].\nIt also covers on-scene treatment with no transport [101].\nEducation systems involve licensed instructors in most states [102].\nTraining programs must follow national standards from CoAEMSP and\nCAAHEP [103].\nContinuing education and refresher courses maintain and update EMT skills\n[105].\nPrevention and public education focus on public health [106].\nPublic health examines the population's health needs [106].\nThe goal is preventing health problems [106].\nEMS works with public health agencies in two ways [107].\nPrimary prevention strategies prevent events from happening [107].\nExamples include pool safety education and car seat installation [107].\nSecondary prevention occurs after an event [108].\nIt aims to decrease the effects of the event [109].\nHelmets and seat belts are examples of secondary prevention [109].\nExamples of public health accomplishments include vaccination programs and\nseat belt laws [110].\n5. Roles and Responsibilities of an EMT\nEMTs are healthcare professionals [116].\nRoles include keeping vehicles and equipment ready [117].\nEnsuring safety is crucial: self, partner, patient, bystanders [117].\nBeing familiar with emergency vehicle operation is needed [117].\nEMTs should be on-scene leaders [117].\nThey perform an evaluation of the scene [117].\nCalling for additional resources when needed is a role [117].\nGaining access to patients is necessary [117].\nPerforming a patient assessment is a key task [117].\nGiving emergency medical care while awaiting resources is essential [117].\nAdministrative support is also required [117].\nConstant professional development is important [118].\nCultivating and sustaining community relations is a role [118].\nGiving back to the profession is encouraged [118].\nProfessional attributes include integrity, acting consistently and honestly\n[119].\nEmpathy involves being aware of others' needs [121].\nSelf-motivation means solving problems without direction [121].\nAppearance and hygiene project trust and professionalism [121].\nSelf-confidence is knowing what you know and don't know [121].\nBeing able to ask for help is part of self-confidence [121].\nTime management involves performing or delegating tasks efficiently [122].\nCommunication means understanding and being understood [122].\nTeamwork and diplomacy involve working with others and respecting them\n[122].\nRespect is holding others in high regard [122].\nPatient advocacy keeps the patient's needs central to care [123].\nCareful delivery of care means paying attention to details [123].\nIt ensures care is done as safely as possible [123].\nEvery patient is entitled to compassion and respect [124].\nEMTs are bound by patient confidentiality [125].\nPatient privacy must be protected [125].\nFindings or disclosures should only be discussed with treating personnel [126].\nLimited disclosures may be made as required by law, like to the police [126].\nProtection of patient privacy is highlighted by hipaa [127].\n6. Licensure and Certification Requirements\nSuccessful completion of the EMT course allows taking national or state\ncertification exams [11].\nAfter passing the certification exam, one is eligible for state licensure [12].\nLicensure is how the state ensures an applicant's competency [13].\nThis process allows states to manage who can be a healthcare provider [14].\nLicensure requirements differ by state but generally include [27]:\nA high school diploma or equivalent [27].\nProof of immunization [27].\nSuccessful background check and drug screening [27].\nA valid driver's license [27].\nSuccessful completion of a recognized BLS CPR course [28].\nSuccessful completion of a state-approved EMT course [28].\nSuccessful completion of state-recognized written and practical exams\n[28].\nDemonstrating necessary mental and physical abilities [28].\nCompliance with other state, local, and employer provisions [28].\nThe americans with disabilities act (ada) protects people with disabilities\n[29].\nIt prevents denial of access to state or local government programs [30].\nIt prohibits employers from denying equal employment to the disabled [31].\nTitle 1 protects EMTs with disabilities seeking employment [32].\nEmployers may need to adjust processes or modify the work environment [33].\nPersonal background information is checked based on state criminal\nrequirements [34].\nStates have requirements prohibiting individuals with misdemeanors or\nfelonies from becoming EMS providers [35].\n7. Quality Improvement and Patient Safety\nThe EMT has a role in the quality improvement process [2].\nThe medical director is responsible for maintaining quality control [91].\nThis involves adopting a just culture [92].\nA just culture promotes a learning culture [92].\nIt balances fairness and accountability [92].\ncontinuous quality improvement (cqi) involves reviews and audits [93].\nCQI identifies areas for improvement and assigns remedial training [94].\nThe goal of CQI is minimizing errors [95].\nIt uses a plan, do, study, act cycle [95].\nPatient safety aims to minimize medical errors [95].\nErrors can result from rules-based, knowledge-based, or skills-based failures\n[95].\nMinimizing errors requires efforts from both the EMS agency and personnel\n[96].\n8. Research and Evidence-Based Decision-Making\nAn EMT has an impact on research and evidence-based decision-making\n[5].\nEMS research helps determine the shape and impact of EMS on the\ncommunity [112].\nevidence-based medicine focuses on procedures proven useful for\nimproving patient outcomes [113].\nMany ems systems consult national model EMS clinical guidelines [114].\nThese guidelines are from the National Association of EMS Officials [114].\nThe guidelines are based on a review of current research and expert\nconsensus [115].",
