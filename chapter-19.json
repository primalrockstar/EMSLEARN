Introduction to Gastrointestinal and Urologic Emergencies\nThis chapter covers gastrointestinal and urologic emergencies for EMTs [1].\nIt is important to understand the anatomy and physiology of these systems [2]\n.\nEMTs will assess and manage patients with various abdominal complaints [3].\nThese complaints include abdominal pain, hypoglycemia, and\nhyperglycemia [3].\nThey also include shock related to acute or chronic gastrointestinal\ndisorders [3].\nHemorrhage, peritonitis, and renal system complications are also covered\n[3].\nYou do not need to determine the exact cause of abdominal pain [7].\nRecognize life-threatening problems and act quickly [8].\nRapid assessment and emotional support are needed for anxious patients in\npain [9].\n2. Anatomy and Physiology of the Abdominal Cavity\nThe abdominal cavity holds solid and hollow organs [9].\nThese organs belong to three systems: gastrointestinal, genital, and urinary\n[10].\nSolid organ injury can cause shock and bleeding [11].\nIf a hollow organ perforates, contents leak and contaminate the abdominal\ncavity [12].\nSystem Solid Organs Hollow Organs\nGastrointestinal Liver, Pancreas,\nSpleen [18]\nStomach, Gallbladder, Small Intestines, Colon\n[15]\nGenital Testicles,\nOvaries [28]\nEpididymis, Vas deferentia, Seminal vesicles,\nProstate gland, Penis, Fallopian tubes,\nUterus, Cervix, Vagina [28]\nUrinary Kidneys [31] Ureters, Bladder, Urethra [31]\nThe gastrointestinal system is for digestion [14].\nDigestion starts in the mouth [15].\nThe stomach breaks down food with gastric juices [15].\nThe liver helps digestion by secreting bile [17].\nIt filters toxic substances and produces blood clotting factors [18].\nThe gallbladder stores bile [19].\nFood goes to the small intestines with three sections [20].\nThe duodenum mixes digestive juices from the pancreas and liver [21].\nThe pancreas secretes enzymes for starches, fats, and proteins [22].\nThe jejunum absorbs digestive products [23].\nThe ileum absorbs later nutrients and bile acids [25].\nThe colon (large intestines) absorbs water and forms stool [26].\nThe spleen is in the abdomen but has no digestive function [27].\nThe abdominal space also contains reproductive organs [27].\nMale organs include testicles and penis [28].\nFemale organs include ovaries and uterus [29].\nThe urinary system controls waste discharge filtered by the kidneys [30].\nThere are two kidneys, one on each side [32].\nUreters connect kidneys to the bladder [33].\nThe urinary bladder is behind the pubic bone [34].\nThe bladder empties through the urethra [34].\nAdults normally form 1.5 to 2 liters of urine daily [35].\n3. Pathophysiology of Abdominal Conditions\nThe peritoneum is a membrane lining the abdominal cavity and covering\norgans [38].\nThe parietal peritoneum lines the cavity walls [40].\nThe visceral peritoneum covers the organs [40].\nForeign material like blood or pus irritates the peritoneum [41].\nThis irritation causes peritonitis [41].\nAcute abdomen is sudden abdominal pain [42].\nIt often needs medical attention [43].\nPeritonitis can cause ileus, paralysis of intestinal contractions [43].\nIleus leads to retained gas and feces, causing distension [43].\nThe stomach empties by vomiting [43].\nDiverticulitis is inflammation of small pockets in muscle walls [44].\nCholecystitis is gallbladder inflammation [44].\nAcute appendicitis is inflammation of the appendix [44].\nCause of Acute\nAbdomen\nSigns and Symptoms\nUlcers [49] Gnawing stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, belching,\nheartburn [50]\nGallstones [52] Severe pain in upper right or mid-abdomen, nausea,\nvomiting, indigestion [54]\nPancreatitis [55] Severe pain in upper quadrants radiating to back, nausea,\nvomiting, distension [56]\nAppendicitis [58] Initial dull pain near naval, later radiating to right lower\nquadrant, nausea [59]\nGI Hemorrhage [63] Vomiting blood (upper GI), bright red stools (lower GI) [65]\nThe parietal peritoneum has nerves like skin nerves [46].\nThis helps identify localized pain [46].\nThe visceral peritoneum is supplied by the autonomic nervous system [47].\nThese nerves are less able to localize pain [47].\nReferred pain results from nervous system connections [48].\nCommon causes of acute abdomen include ulcers [49].\nUlcers are erosion of the protective lining [49].\nMost are caused by infection or NSAID use [50].\nComplications include hematemesis, melena, or peritonitis [51].\nGallstones can block the gallbladder outlet [52].\nThis can cause gallbladder inflammation [53].\nPancreatitis can be caused by gallstones or alcohol abuse [55].\nComplications include sepsis and hemorrhage [57].\nAppendicitis is inflammation or infection of the appendix [58].\nSigns include dull umbilical pain radiating to the right lower quadrant [59].\nNausea, vomiting, fever, and chills may be present [60].\nRebound tenderness can occur [61].\nComplications include abscesses, peritonitis, or shock [62].\nGastrointestinal hemorrhage is a symptom of other diseases [63].\nIt can be acute or chronic [63].\nIt occurs in the upper or lower GI tract [63].\nUpper causes include esophageal varices or Mallory-Weiss tear [64].\nLower causes include inflammation, diverticulitis, cancer, or hemorrhoids\n[64].\nEsophagitis is inflammation of the esophagus lining [66].\nGERD is a common cause [67].\nSymptoms include pain swallowing and heartburn [67].\nEsophageal varices are increased pressure in blood vessels near the\nesophagus [68].\nThis is often due to liver failure [68].\nAlcohol or viral hepatitis are common causes [69].\nPatients may show signs of liver disease [70].\nRupture is sudden with vomiting bright red blood, hypotension, and shock\nsigns [71].\nComplication is significant blood loss [72].\nMallory-Weiss syndrome is a tear at the esophagus-stomach junction [73].\nViolent coughing or vomiting is a cause [73].\nSymptoms include shock, upper abdominal pain, hematemesis, and\nmelena [73].\nGastroenteritis is infection with diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting [73].\nNon-infectious conditions can also cause it [73].\nSymptoms include diarrhea, cramping, nausea, vomiting, and fever [73].\nComplications include dehydration and shock [73].\nDiverticulitis is due to a lack of fiber causing hard stools [74].\nThis increases pressure and causes bulges in the colon walls [75].\nFecal matter gets caught, leading to inflammation and infection [76].\nPain is often in the left lower quadrant [77].\nComplications include perforation and shock [78].\nHemorrhoids are swollen blood vessels around the rectum [79].\nIncreased pressure in the rectum is a common cause [80].\nSigns are painless, bright red bleeding during defecation [81].\n4. Urinary System Emergencies\nCystitis is bladder inflammation, often a UTI [83].\nBacterial infection is a common cause [84].\nSymptoms include midline lower abdominal pain and blood in the urine [85].\nUrgency, frequency, pressure, and pain around the bladder occur [85].\nComplications include kidney infections [85].\nThe kidneys maintain homeostasis [87].\nUremia results when kidneys fail [87].\nKidney stones can cause blockages [88].\nAcute kidney failure is a sudden decrease in function [89].\nCauses include hemorrhage, dehydration, trauma, and shock [89].\nSepsis, heart failure, medications, and drug abuse can cause it [90].\nKidney stones are also a cause [90].\nIt may be reversible with prompt treatment [90].\nChronic kidney failure is progressive and irreversible damage [91].\nCommon causes are diabetes and hypertension [92].\nSymptoms include lethargy, nausea, headaches, and cramps [93].\nAnemia, seizures, and coma occur later [93].\nDialysis is eventually required [93].\nThese patients have an increased risk of heart failure and cardiac arrest\n[94].\nFor end-stage renal disease, dialysis is the definitive treatment [131].\nDialysis filters blood and removes toxins [132].\nMissing treatment can lead to weakness and pulmonary edema [133].\nDialysis machines function like normal kidneys [135].\nPatients undergoing long-term hemodialysis have a shunt connecting a vein\nand artery [135].\nThis shunt allows blood to flow to the dialysis machine [136].\nPeritoneal dialysis infuses fluid into the abdominal cavity [137].\nThe fluid stays for one to two hours [138].\nIt carries a high risk of peritonitis [138].\nAdverse effects of dialysis include hypotension and dysrhythmias [139].\nChest pain, muscle cramps, nausea, and vomiting can occur [139].\nHemorrhage from the access site is possible [139].\nInfection can occur at the access site [140].\nManagement of dialysis patients includes ABCs [140].\nProvide high flow oxygen if needed [140].\nManage bleeding from the access site [140].\nPosition the patient sitting up for pulmonary edema or supine for shock\n[140].\nPrompt transport is important [140].\nDialysis patients may have urinary catheters [141].\nCatheters can be a site of infection [141].\n5. Other Abdominal Emergencies\nGynecologic problems are a common cause of acute abdominal pain [95].\nLower quadrant pain may be related to the ovaries, fallopian tubes, or uterus\n[97].\nThe aorta lies behind the peritoneum [99].\nWeak areas can form an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) [99].\nCondition Description Signs/Symptoms\n(General)\nSigns of\nStrangulation\nAbdominal\nAortic\nAneurysm\n(AAA) [99]\nWeak area in the\naorta behind the\nperitoneum [99]\nDifficulty detecting,\ntearing back pain [100]\nMassive\nhemorrhage if\ntears or ruptures\n[102]\nHernia [103] Protrusion of\norgan/tissue\nthrough a hole\n[103]\nMay not have a\nnoticeable mass [106]\nNo longer\nreducible, pain,\ndiscoloration [109]\nAAA is difficult to detect [100].\nSigns can include back pain with a tearing sensation [101].\nUse extreme caution when assessing for AAA [101].\nIf an aneurysm tears or ruptures, massive hemorrhage can occur [102].\nA hernia is a protrusion of an organ or tissue [103].\nIt goes through a hole or opening into another body cavity [104].\nCauses include congenital defects or weak areas like the groin [105].\nReducible hernias can be pushed back and pose little risk [107].\nStrangulation is a serious injury [108].\nBlood supply is compromised by compressed tissues [108].\nSigns include a mass that is no longer reducible [109].\nPain and tenderness at the hernia site occur [110].\nRed or blue skin discoloration over the hernia indicates strangulation [110].\n6. Patient Assessment for Abdominal Emergencies\nPatient assessment starts with scene size-up [112].\nUse standard precautions [112].\nDetermine the mechanism of injury or nature of illness [113].\nAcute abdomen can result from trauma [113].\nDevelop suspicion for life threats based on assessment [113].\nPrimary assessment's priority is to identify and treat life threats [114].\nForm a general impression [115].\nAssess ABCs and Ds [115].\nAirway and breathing may be shallow due to pain [115].\nAssess for major bleeding during circulation assessment [116].\nAsk about blood in vomit or stools [116].\nPulse rate and skin condition indicate shock [117].\nCheck pulses in both feet [117].\nDifferent pulse strengths may indicate aortic dissection [118].\nImmediate transport is needed for signs of significant illness [119].\nTake a SAMPLE history [120].\nAsk about nausea, vomiting, and bowel changes [120].\nAsk about urination, weight loss, or belching [120].\nAsk about pain, other symptoms, or chest pain [120].\nSecondary assessment includes patient positioning [121].\nPositioning may give clues about the illness [121].\nThe physical exam involves assessing the abdomen [121].\nA normal abdomen is soft and not tender [121].\nPain and tenderness are common symptoms [122].\nLocalized pain can indicate the problem [122].\nAbdominal muscles may be rigid (guarding) [123].\nTake vital signs [124].\nHigh respiratory rate with normal pulse/BP may mean improper ventilation\n[125].\nHigh respiratory rate and pulse with shock signs may indicate septic or\nhypovolemic shock [126].\nAvoid blood pressure in an arm with a dialysis shunt [126].\nFrequent reassessments are important [127].\nAssess interventions like shock treatment [127].\nProvide emotional support [127].\nTransport in a comfortable position [127].\nConsider advanced life support [128].\nCommunication and documentation are important [128].\n7. Emergency Care and Management\nYou cannot treat the causes of pain, but you can provide comfort [128].\nLessen the effects of shock [128].\nTreat for shock even without obvious signs [128].\nPosition vomiting patients to maintain their airway [129].\nContain vomit to prevent infectious disease spread [129].\nUse biohazard bags [129].\nWear gloves, eye protection, gown, and mask [129].\nClean the ambulance and equipment after patient release [130].\nWash your hands even after wearing gloves [130].\nProvide low flow oxygen [130].\nThis may decrease nausea and anxiety [130].\n8.
