Introduction to Chest Injuries\nchest trauma results in over 1.2 million emergency department visits annually\n[6].\nThese injuries can affect the heart, lungs, and great vessels [7].\nThey can be caused by blunt trauma, penetrating trauma, or both [7].\nEMTs must immediately treat any injuries that interfere with normal breathing\n[8].\nInternal bleeding can accumulate, compressing the heart and lungs [9].\nAir can also collect, preventing the lungs from expanding [9].\nTrauma Type Description Causes\nBlunt Trauma Skin is not broken [46] Generally caused by blunt\nforce [47]\nPenetrating\nTrauma\nObject penetrates the chest\nwall [55]\nObject pierces the chest wall\n[55]\nBoth Combination of blunt and\npenetrating forces [7]\nCan involve both blunt impact\nand penetration [7]\n2. Anatomy and Physiology of the Chest\nventilation is the body's ability to move air in and out [12].\noxygenation is delivering oxygen to the blood by diffusion [13].\nInjuries affecting ventilation and oxygenation are serious and life-threatening\n[13].\nThe thoracic cage extends from the neck to the diaphragm [14].\nPenetrating chest injuries can also injure the liver, spleen, or stomach [15].\nStriated muscle like intercostal muscles allows for ventilation [17].\nintercostal muscles extend between the ribs and allow the chest to expand\n[18].\nThe neurovascular bundle lies along the ribs and can cause significant\nbleeding [21].\nThe pleura covers the lungs and thoracic cavity [23].\nParietal pleura lines the chest wall, and visceral pleura covers the lung [24].\npleural fluid allows lungs to move freely [25].\nThe ribs connect to the vertebrae and sternum [26].\nThe trachea divides into bronchi that supply air to the lungs [27].\nThe thoracic cage contains the heart and great vessels [28].\nThe mediastinum is the central chest area with the heart, vessels,\nesophagus, and trachea [29].\nThe diaphragm separates the thoracic and abdominal cavities [30].\n3. Mechanics of Ventilation and Respiration\nintercostal muscles and the diaphragm contract during inhalation [32].\nThis decreases intrathoracic pressure, creating negative pressure [34].\nNegative pressure allows air into the lungs [34].\nMuscles relax during exhalation, allowing air out [35].\nSpinal cord injuries below C5 may affect intercostal muscles [36].\nThe diaphragm should still contract with intact phrenic nerves [37].\nSpinal injuries at C3 or above can cause complete inability to breathe [37].\ntidal volume is the air moved in a single breath, about 500 ml [38].\nminute volume is tidal volume multiplied by breaths per minute [40].\nChanging tidal or minute volume affects air movement [41].\nBag-mask devices can deliver 1000 to 1500 ml of air [42].\nOverventilation can cause gastric distension and impair lung function [43].\nOverventilation can also increase intrathoracic pressure, reducing cardiac\noutput [44].\nMeasurement Calculation Average Value\nTidal Volume Air moved in one breath ~500 ml [39]\nMinute Volume Tidal Volume x Breaths per Minute Affects air movement [41]\n4. Types of Chest Injuries: Closed vs. Open\nThere are two main types: open or closed [45].\nIn closed chest injuries, the skin is not broken [46].\nThese are usually caused by blunt trauma [47].\nBlunt trauma can cause cardiac contusion and pulmonary contusion [48].\nHeart damage can lead to cardiogenic shock [50].\nLung bruising can decrease gas exchange, causing hypoxic and hypercarbic\nstates [52].\nRib fractures can lacerate lung tissue and vessels, leading to hypovolemic\nshock [54].\nIn an open chest injury, an object penetrates the chest wall [55].\nThis causes immediate damage, but symptoms can develop over time [55].\nDo not remove an impaled object as it may be stopping bleeding [56].\nRemoving it could cause heavy bleeding and further damage [57].\nBlunt trauma can fracture ribs, sternum, chest wall, and damage the aorta [58].\nNearly one-third of car crash fatalities are due to aortic rupture [59].\nInjury Type Skin\nCondition\nCause Potential Consequences\nClosed Chest\nInjury\nNot broken\n[46]\nBlunt trauma\n[47]\nCardiac/Pulmonary contusion,\nCardiogenic/Hypovolemic shock\n[48]\nOpen Chest\nInjury\nBroken [55] Penetrating\nobject [55]\nImmediate damage, potential\nbleeding from impaled object [55]\n5. Signs and Symptoms of Chest Injuries\nSigns include pain at the injury site [60].\nPain often worsens with breathing [60].\nLook for bruising on the chest wall [60].\nCrepitus may be felt when touching the chest [60].\nAny penetrating injury is a sign [60].\nDyspnea (difficulty breathing) is common [60].\nOne or both sides of the chest may not expand normally [60].\nA rapid weak pulse and low blood pressure can indicate injury [60].\nLook for cyanosis around the lips or fingernails [60].\nDiminished breath sounds on one side may be present [60].\nLow oxygen saturation is a key sign [60].\nPatients often have tachypnea (rapid breathing) [61].\nRespirations may be shallow due to pain [61].\n6. Patient Assessment for Chest Trauma\nBegin with scene size-up, ensuring safety and precautions [62].\nDo not disturb evidence if it's a crime scene [63].\nRequest law enforcement for violent scenes [64].\nCall for utility, fire, and ALS early if needed [65].\nDetermine the mechanism of injury, common in crashes, falls, industrial\naccidents, and assaults [66].\nDetermine the number of patients and consider spinal stabilization [68].\nPerform a primary assessment, starting with a general impression [69].\nAddress life-threatening hemorrhage immediately, even before airway [70].\nNote the patient's level of consciousness [72].\nPerform a rapid physical exam [72].\nAssess airway and breathing (A and B) [73].\nEnsure a clear and patent airway [75].\nConsider early cervical spinal immobilization for blunt trauma [76].\nNote jugular vein distension, a sign of pressure on the heart [77].\nDetermine if breathing is present and adequate [78].\nInspect for DCAP-BTLS (deformities, contusions, abrasions, punctures,\nburns, tenderness, lacerations, swelling) [78].\nCheck for equal chest wall expansion [79].\nLook for paradoxical motion, indicating multiple fractured ribs [79].\nApply an occlusive dressing to all penetrating chest injuries [80].\nApply oxygen with a non-rebreather mask at 15 liters [81].\nProvide positive pressure ventilation at 100% if breathing is inadequate [81].\nBe alert for decreasing oxygen saturation [82].\nWatch for signs of impending tension pneumothorax [82].\nAssess circulation (C) [73].\nAssess pulse presence and adequacy [83].\nConsider the patient in shock if the pulse is abnormal or skin is pale, cool, or\nclammy [83].\nAddress life-threatening external bleeding immediately [83].\nMake transport decisions, prioritizing those with airway, breathing, or\ncirculation issues [84].\nPay attention to subtle clues like skin appearance, consciousness, and a\nsense of impending doom [84].\nWhen in doubt, transport the patient rapidly [84].\nTake history, investigating the chief complaint and mechanism of injury [86].\nIdentify associated signs, symptoms, and pertinent negatives [86].\nAsk about the mechanism, speed, safety equipment, weapon, and number of\nwounds [87].\nGet a SAMPLE history (Signs, Allergies, Medications, Past medical history,\nLast oral intake, Events leading up to injury) [87].\nComplete a basic evaluation if time allows [87].\nPerform a secondary assessment [88].\nFor isolated injury, focus on the affected area [89].\nEnsure wounds are identified and bleeding is controlled [90].\nLocate the extent of the injury and assess underlying systems [90].\nAssess the anterior and posterior chest wall [90].\nNote changes in the ability to maintain adequate respirations [90].\nFor significant trauma, perform a rapid physical exam using DCAP-BTLS [91].\nAssessment Step Key Actions Source\nScene Size-up Ensure safety, identify MOI, consider spinal\nstabilization\n[62]\nPrimary\nAssessment\nGeneral impression, address hemorrhage,\nassess LOC, rapid physical exam\n[69]\nAirway &\nBreathing\nEnsure patent airway, spinal immobilization\n(blunt trauma), assess breathing\n[74]\nInterventions\n(A&B)\nApply occlusive dressing, oxygen, positive\npressure ventilation\n[80]\nCirculation Assess pulse, look for shock, control external\nbleeding\n[83]\nTransport\nDecision\nPrioritize rapid transport for ABC problems\n[84]\nHistory Taking Investigate chief complaint, MOI, get SAMPLE\nhistory\n[86]\nSecondary\nAssessment\nPhysical exam focusing on isolated or\nsignificant trauma, DCAP-BTLS\n[88]\n7. Vital Signs and Reassessment\nAssess pulse, respiration, blood pressure, skin condition, oxygen\nsaturation, and pupils [92].\nRe-evaluate the patient every five minutes or less [93].\nA rapid pulse or respiratory rate can indicate hypoxia or blood loss [93].\nIncreased work of breathing is shown by the use of accessory muscles [94].\nPulse and respiratory rates may decrease in later stages [94].\nReassess by repeating the primary assessment [95].\nReassess the chief complaint [95].\nRe-evaluate airway, breathing, pulse, perfusion, and bleeding [95].\n8. Management and Interventions for Chest Injuries\nReassess vital signs and observe trends [96].\nProvide appropriate spinal immobilization for blunt trauma with suspected\nspinal injuries [96].\nMaintain an open airway [96].\nControl significant visible bleeding [96].\nPlace a vented chest seal or semi-vented dressing over penetrating trauma\n[96].\nProvide aggressive treatment for shock [96].\nTransport rapidly [96].\nDo not delay transport for non-life-saving treatments [97].\nThese treatments can be performed en route [97].\nCommunicate all relevant information to the receiving facility staff [97].\nKey Intervention Purpose Source\nSpinal Mobilization Protect potential spinal injuries in blunt\ntrauma\n[96]\nMaintain Open Airway Ensure clear passage for air\n[96]\nControl Visible Bleeding Stop external blood loss\n[96]\nVented Chest\nSeal/Dressing\nSeal penetrating wounds, allow air to\nescape\n[96]\nAggressive Shock\nTreatment\nAddress inadequate perfusion\n[96]\nRapid Transport Get patient to higher level of care\nquickly\n[96]\n9. Specific Chest Injuries: Pneumothorax\nPneumothorax is the accumulation of air in the pleural space [98].\nAir enters through a hole in the chest wall or lung surface [99].\nBreathing attempts cause the lung on that side to collapse [100].\nBlood passing through the collapsed lung is not oxygenated [101].\nDiminished breath sounds may occur if the lung collapses significantly [102].\nAbsent breath sounds may indicate a tension pneumothorax [103].\nA sucking sound on inhalation and rushing air on exhalation indicate a\npenetrated chest [103].\nAn open chest wound is called an open pneumothorax or sucking chest\nwound [105].\nThese wounds must be sealed with an occlusive dressing after airway\nmanagement and oxygen [106].\nA flutter valve is a one-way valve letting air out but not in [107].\nFollow local protocols for flutter valves [108].\nAn occlusive dressing can be taped on three sides to allow air to leak from\none side [109].\nMonitor for signs of tension pneumothorax after applying the dressing [110].\nIf tension pneumothorax develops, open one side of the occlusive dressing\n[111].\nA simple pneumothorax does not significantly change cardiac physiology\n[114].\nIt's often caused by blunt chest trauma resulting in fractured ribs [114].\nSigns include pleuritic pain, dyspnea, tachypnea, accessory muscle use,\ndecreased oxygen saturation, and subcutaneous emphysema [115].\nLate findings can be decreased breath sounds, lethargy, and cyanosis [116].\nPre-hospital treatment involves high flow O2 and monitoring [117].\ntension pneumothorax is ongoing air accumulation in the pleural space [118].\nIncreased pressure causes complete collapse of the uninfected lung [119].\nThe mediastinum is pushed into the opposite cavity [120].\nIt's more commonly caused by blunt trauma where a fractured rib lacerates\nthe lung [120].\nCommon signs include chest pain, tachycardia, marked respiratory distress,\nlow oxygen saturation, and absent or decreased lung sounds on the affected\nside [121].\nSigns of shock, JVD, cyanosis, or tracheal deviation may also be present but\nnot always [121].\nPre-hospital treatment includes ventilatory support with high flow oxygen [122]\n.\nRequest advanced life support and transport immediately [122].\nNeedle decompression may be performed by ALS or ED staff [123].\nType of\nPneumothorax\nCause Signs/Symptoms Management\nSimple\nPneumothorax\nBlunt trauma,\nfractured ribs\n[114]\nPleuritic pain, dyspnea,\ntachypnea, accessory\nmuscle use, decreased\nO2 sat, subcutaneous\nemphysema [115]\nHigh flow O2,\nmonitor readings\nand breath\nsounds [117]\nOpen\nPneumothorax\nPenetrating\nchest wound\n[105]\nSucking sound on\ninhalation, rushing air on\nexhalation [103]\nSeal with\nocclusive\ndressing (vented\nor taped on 3\nsides), monitor\n[106]\nTension\nPneumothorax\nOngoing air\naccumulation,\nlung laceration\n[118]\nChest pain, tachycardia,\nrespiratory distress, low\nO2 sat,\nabsent/decreased lung\nVentilatory\nsupport with high\nflow O2, request\nALS, immediate\ntransport [122]\nsounds, JVD, cyanosis\n(late) [121]\n10. Specific Chest Injuries: Hemothorax and Hemopneumothorax\nhemothorax is the collection of blood in the pleural space [124].\nThis blood comes from bleeding around the rib cage, lung, or great vessel [125]\n.\nWhen both blood and air are present, it's called a hemopneumothorax [127].\nSuspect a hemothorax if the patient shows signs of shock without obvious\nexternal bleeding [128].\nDecreased breath sounds on the affected side are also a sign [128].\nBleeding cannot be controlled in the pre-hospital setting [129].\nProvide rapid transport to a facility capable of performing surgery [129].\n11. Specific Chest Injuries: Cardiac Tamponade\ncardiac tamponade occurs when the pericardial sac fills with blood or fluid\n[131].\nThis prevents the heart from pumping enough blood [132].\nFluid buildup compresses the heart's chambers [132].\nThis dramatically impairs the heart's ability to pump blood [132].\nSigns and symptoms are known as beck's triad [133].\nComponent Description Source\nDistended Jugular\nVeins\nEngorged veins on both sides of the trachea\n[133]\n[133]\nNarrowing Pulse\nPressure\nDecreasing difference between systolic and\ndiastolic BP [133]\n[133]\nMuffled Heart Tones Heart sounds are difficult to hear [133]\n[133]\nPre-hospital care includes supporting ventilations [134].\nRapidly transporting the patient to a facility capable of intervention is crucial\n[134].\n12. Specific Chest Injuries: Rib Fractures and Flail Chest\nRib fractures are common, especially in older patients [135].\nFractures of the upper four ribs suggest a substantial mechanism of injury\n[136].\nA fractured rib can lacerate the lung surface [137].\nThis can cause pneumothorax, tension pneumothorax, hemothorax, or\nhemopneumothorax [137].\nPatients report localized tenderness and pain when breathing [138].\nPre-hospital treatment includes supplemental oxygen [139].\nA flail chest is caused by two or more adjacent fractures in two or more\nplaces [140].\nThis detaches a segment of the chest wall [140].\nThe detached segment moves opposite to normal breathing, called\nparadoxical motion [141].\nparadoxical motion is a late sign [142].\nPre-hospital treatment includes maintaining the airway [143].\nProvide respiratory support if needed [144].\nGive supplemental oxygen [144].\nPerform ongoing assessments for pneumothorax or respiratory complications\n[144].\nTreatment may include positive pressure ventilation with a bag valve mask\n[145].\nRestricting chest wall movement with a bulky dressing is no longer\nrecommended [146].\nflail chest may indicate serious internal damage and possible spinal injury [147].\n13. Other Chest Injuries\npulmonary contusion should be suspected with a flail chest [148].\nAlveoli fill with blood, and fluid accumulates, causing hypoxia [148].\nTreatment includes supplemental oxygen and positive pressure ventilations\n[149].\nSternal fractures require significant force and may involve lungs, vessels, and\nheart [150].\nClavicle fractures can damage the neurovascular bundle [152].\nSuspect upper rib fractures with medial clavicle fractures [152].\nBe alert for signs of a developing hemothorax [152].\ntraumatic asphyxia results from severe chest compression [153].\nIt causes increased pressure in the chest [153].\nCharacteristics include distended neck veins, cyanosis of face and neck, and\nhemorrhage into the sclera [154].\nThis suggests underlying heart injury and possible pulmonary contusions [155].\nTreatment involves ventilatory support with supplemental oxygen and\nmonitoring during transport [156].\ncommotio cordis is a blunt injury from a sudden blow to the chest [157].\nIt occurs during a critical part of the heartbeat [157].\nThis results in immediate cardiac arrest, often ventricular fibrillation [157].\nIt is often responsive to defibrillation and early CPR [158].\nMore common in sports injuries, suspect it in unconscious patients after a\nchest blow [159].\nLaceration of great vessels can cause massive, rapidly fatal hemorrhage [159]\n.\nTreatment includes CPR, ventilatory support, immediate transport, and\nmonitoring for shock [160].\nInjury Type Cause Key Features/Signs Management\nPulmonary\nContusion\nFlail chest, blunt\ntrauma [148]\nAlveoli filled with\nblood, fluid\naccumulation, hypoxia\n[148]\nSupplemental O2,\npositive pressure\nventilations [149]\nSternal\nFractures\nSignificant force\n[150]\nMay involve lungs,\ngreat vessels, heart\n[151]\nAssess for\nunderlying injuries\n[151]\nClavicle\nFractures\nSignificant force\n[152]\nPossible damage to\nneurovascular bundle,\nsuspect upper rib\nfractures, hemothorax\n[152]\nAssess for\nassociated injuries\n[152]\nTraumatic\nAsphyxia\nSevere chest\ncompression [153]\nDistended neck veins,\nface/neck cyanosis,\nscleral hemorrhage\n[154]\nVentilatory\nsupport,\nsupplemental O2,\nimmediate\ntransport [156]\nCommotio\nCordis\nSudden blow to\nchest during critical\nheartbeat [157]\nImmediate cardiac\narrest (VF) [157]\nEarly CPR,\ndefibrillation,\nsuspect in\nunconscious after\nchest blow [158]\nGreat Vessel\nLaceration\nPenetrating/blunt\ntrauma [159]\nMassive, rapidly fatal\nhemorrhage [159]\nCPR, ventilatory\nsupport,\nimmediate\ntransport, monitor\nfor shock [160]\n14. Review and Conclusion\nAortic shearing kills almost one-third of patients in rapid deceleration car\ncrashes [163].\nThe aorta is the body's largest artery [165].\nShearing from its structures causes rapid bleeding out [166].\nSigns of chest injury do not typically include hemoemesis (vomiting blood)\n[167].\nFor an open wound to the chest from a stabbing, the immediate action is to\ncover the wound with an occlusive dressing [167].\nWhen caring for a patient with signs of pneumothorax, the most immediate\nconcern is ventilatory inadequacy [168].\nA one-way flutter valve allows air trapped in the pleural space to be released\n[169].\nSigns of cardiac tamponade include distended jugular veins, narrowing\npulse pressure, and muffled heart tones (beck's triad) [133].\nCollapsed jugular veins are not a sign of cardiac tamponade [170].\ntraumatic asphyxia, characterized by scleral hemorrhage, is also\naccompanied by cyanosis to the face and neck [171].\nImmediate cardiac arrest in a baseball player hit in the chest is likely\ncommotio cordis [172].\nParadoxical chest movement is typically seen in patients with a flail chest\n[174].\nA patient with a large bruise over the sternum and irregular pulse after hitting\na steering wheel is likely to have injured their myocardium (bruised heart\nmuscle) [175].",
