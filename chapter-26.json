Introduction to Bleeding and the Circulatory System\nComponent Function\nHeart Pumps blood [7]\nBlood Vessels Serve as the container for blood [7]\nBlood and Body Fluids The fluid circulated [7]\nBleeding can be external and visible or internal and hidden [4].\nBoth types of bleeding are potentially dangerous and can lead to weakness, shock,\nand death [4].\nUncontrolled bleeding is a common cause of hypoperfusion following traumatic\ninjury [5].\nThe circulatory system circulates blood to all body cells and tissues [5].\nIt delivers oxygen and nutrients and carries away metabolic waste products [6].\nThe system is responsible for supplying and maintaining adequate blood flow [6].\nThe contents of the circulatory system are the heart (pump), blood vessels\n(container), and blood and body fluids (fluid) [7].\nThe heart requires a rich and well-distributed blood supply [9].\nIt works as two paired pumps: the upper chamber (atrium) and the lower chamber\n(ventricles) [10].\nBlood leaves each chamber through a one-way valve [11].\nTypes of blood vessels include arteries, arterioles, capillaries, venules, and veins [13]\n.\nOxygen and nutrients pass from capillaries into cells, while waste and carbon dioxide\ndiffuse from cells back into capillaries [14].\nBlood contains red blood cells (oxygen/carbon dioxide transport), white blood cells\n(fighting infection), platelets (forming blood clots), and plasma (liquid part) [15].\nBlood clot formation depends on blood stasis, changes in blood vessel walls (like a\nwound), or the blood's ability to clot [18].\nThe autonomic nervous system monitors the body's needs and adjusts blood flow by\nconstricting or dilating blood vessels [20].\nIt automatically redirects blood away from other organs to the heart, brain, lungs, and\nkidneys in an emergency [22].\nThis system adapts to changing conditions and maintains homeostasis and perfusion\n[22].\n2. Pathophysiology and Perfusion\nperfusion is the circulation of blood within an organ or tissue [24].\nIt must be in adequate amounts to meet cell needs for oxygen, nutrients, and waste\nremoval [24].\nBlood flow speed must be fast enough to maintain adequate circulation and avoid\nclotting [24].\nIt must also be slow enough to allow cells time to exchange oxygen and nutrients for\nwaste products [24].\nSome tissues need a constant blood supply [25].\nOthers can survive with very little blood [25].\nAll tissues, organs, and organ systems rely on adequate perfusion to function\nproperly [26].\nSome organs cannot tolerate a blood supply interruption for more than a few minutes\nwithout damage [27].\nDeath of an organ system can quickly lead to the death of a patient [28].\nThe heart requires a constant flow of blood [29].\nIf the circulatory system fails to provide significant circulation, shock results [23].\n3. External Bleeding: Characteristics and Assessment\nType of\nBleeding\nCharacteristics Manageability Appearance Spurting Clotting\nArterial Pressure\ncauses spurting\n[38]\nDifficult to\ncontrol [38]\nBrighter red\n[39]\nSpurts with\npulse [39]\nLess likely to\nclot\nspontaneously\n[41]\nVenous Does not spurt\n[40]\nEasy to\nmanage [40]\nDark red [39] Does not\nspurt [40]\nMore likely to\nclot\nspontaneously\n[40]\nCapillary Oozes from\nwound [41]\nSteady but\nslowly [41]\nDark red [41] Oozes [41] More likely to\nclot\nspontaneously\nthan arterial\n[41]\nhemorrhage means bleeding, and external bleeding is a visible hemorrhage [29].\nWith serious external bleeding, estimating the amount of blood loss can be difficult [30]\n.\nBlood looks different on different surfaces, making estimation important [31].\nThe body cannot tolerate an acute blood loss greater than 20 percent of blood\nvolume (about two pints) [32].\nAdverse changes in vital signs occur with significant blood loss [33].\nThese include an increase in heart rate, an increase in respiratory rate, and a\ndecrease in blood pressure [33].\nHow well people compensate for blood loss depends on how rapidly they bleed [34].\nRapid blood loss, even if less than 20%, can cause signs of hypovolemic shock [35].\nThe patient's age and pre-existing health should also be considered [36].\nBleeding is considered serious if certain conditions are present [37].\nThese conditions include poor general appearance, no response to external stimuli,\nsigns of shock, significant blood loss, rapid blood loss, uncontrolled bleeding, or a\nsignificant mechanism of injury [37].\nTypes of external bleeding are arterial, venous, and capillary [38].\nArterial bleeding spurts with the pulse and is typically brighter red [39].\nVenous bleeding is dark red and does not spurt [40].\nCapillary bleeding is dark red and oozes slowly [41].\nVenous and capillary bleeding are more likely to clot spontaneously than arterial\nbleeding [40].\n4. The Clotting Process and Hemophilia\nBleeding tends to stop within about 10 minutes in response to internal mechanisms\nand exposure to air [42].\nWhen skin is broken, blood flows rapidly from the open vessel [42].\nThe cut ends of the vessel begin to narrow, a process called vasoconstriction [43].\nvasoconstriction reduces the amount of bleeding [44].\nThen a clot forms [44].\nBleeding will not stop if a clot does not form, unless the injured vessel is cut off by\ndirect pressure or a tourniquet [45].\nWith hemophilia, the patient lacks one or more blood clotting factors [46].\nBleeding may occur spontaneously in hemophiliacs [46].\nAll injuries, even trivial ones, are potentially serious for patients with hemophilia [46].\nhemophiliac patients should be transported immediately [46].\n5. Internal Bleeding: Recognition and Assessment\nPossible Causes Signs and Symptoms\nStomach ulcer [51] Pain (most common) [57]\nLacerated liver [51] Swelling in the area [57]\nRuptured spleen [51] Distension (chest cavity, lung) [57]\nBroken bones [51] Hematoma or bruising [57]\nContusions or\necchymosis [52]\nBleeding from any body opening (mouth, rectum, hematuria,\nvaginal, hematemesis, melena) [57]\nUlcers [55] Pain, tenderness, bruising, guarding, or swelling (possible\nfractures) [58]\nBleeding in the colon [55] Rigid, distended abdomen [58]\nRuptured ectopic\npregnancy [55]\nChange in mental status (anxiety, restlessness,\ncombativeness) [59]\nAneurysms [55] Weakness, faintness, or dizziness on standing [59]\nClosed unstable pelvic\nfracture [111]\nChange in skin [60]\nTachycardia [60]\nThirst [60]\nNausea and vomiting [60]\nCool, moist, clammy skin [60]\nShallow, rapid breathing [60]\nDull eyes, slightly dilated pupils slow to respond to light [60]\nCap refill over two seconds (infants, children) [61]\nWeak rapid pulse [61]\nDecreasing blood pressure [61]\nAltered mental status [61]\nInternal bleeding can be very serious because it is not easy to detect immediately [48]\n.\nInjury or damage to internal organs commonly causes extensive internal bleeding [49].\nInternal bleeding can lead to hypovolemic shock [50].\nPossible causes include stomach ulcers, lacerated liver, ruptured spleen, and broken\nbones [51].\nSigns of internal bleeding may include contusions or ecchymosis [52].\nA high-speed mechanism of injury increases suspicion for serious unseen injury [52].\nBlunt trauma and penetrating trauma are mechanisms for internal bleeding [53].\nThe mnemonic DCAP-BTLS is used to assess for signs of injuries [53].\nThis stands for deformities, contusions, abrasions, punctures, penetrations, burns,\nlateral tenderness, laceration, swelling, and other signs of injury [53].\nInternal bleeding is not always caused by trauma [54].\nNon-traumatic causes can be ulcers, bleeding in the colon, ruptured ectopic\npregnancy, or aneurysms [55].\nRecognizing a patient in shock and responding appropriately is important [56].\nSigns and symptoms of internal bleeding include pain, swelling, distension, and\nbruising (hematoma) [57].\nBleeding from any body opening can indicate internal bleeding [57].\nThis includes bright red bleeding from the mouth or rectum, hematuria, non-menstrual\nvaginal bleeding, hematemesis (vomiting blood), and melena (black, tarry stool) [57].\nPain, tenderness, bruising, guarding, or swelling can indicate possible closed fractures\nor broken ribs [58].\nA rigid, distended abdomen might be seen [58].\nhypoperfusion (hypovolemic shock) can cause changes in mental status like anxiety,\nrestlessness, or combativeness [59].\nWeakness, faintness, or dizziness on standing are signs [59].\nChanges in skin can also occur [60].\nLater signs of hypoperfusion include tachycardia, weakness, fainting, thirst, nausea,\nvomiting, and cool, clammy skin [60].\nShallow, rapid breathing, dull eyes, slightly dilated pupils, and a weak rapid pulse may\nbe present [60].\nCapillary refill over two seconds in infants and children is a sign [61].\nDecreasing blood pressure and altered mental status are also indicators [61].\nPatients with these signs and symptoms require prompt transport [61].\n6. Patient Assessment in Bleeding Emergencies\nThe scene size-up involves being alert for potential hazards, especially in violent\nincidents [62].\nEnsure police are on scene if necessary and follow standard precautions [62].\nConsider the mechanism of injury and the need for spinal immobilization and\nadditional resources [62].\nThe primary assessment focuses on identifying life threats without distraction [63].\nForm a general impression to identify serious conditions [64].\nPerform a rapid exam [65].\nAddress obvious life-threatening external bleeding first [65].\nAssess skin color [65].\nDetermine the level of consciousness using the AVPU scale [66].\nAssess the ABCs (Airway, Breathing, Circulation) and the D (Transport Decision)\n[67].\nEnsure a patent airway and provide high-flow oxygen [67].\nAssist ventilations if needed using a bag-valve mask or non-rebreather mask [68].\nInsert an oral pharyngeal airway if the patient is unconscious [68].\nAssess pulse rate and quality, skin condition, color, temperature, and cap refill time for\ncirculation [69].\nControl external bleeding and treat for shock [69].\nMake the transport decision based on ABCs and life threats [70].\nPatients with significant bleeding can become unstable quickly [72].\nSigns needing rapid transport include tachycardia, tachypnea, low blood pressure,\nweak pulse, or clammy skin [73].\nHistory taking involves investigating the chief complaint [74].\nLook for signs and symptoms of other injuries based on the mechanism of injury or\nnature of illness [75].\nGather the SAMPLE history (Signs, Allergies, Medications, Past medical history, Last\noral intake, Events leading up to injury) [76].\nAsk about blood-thinning medications [76].\nFor unresponsive patients, get history from medical alert tags or bystanders [77].\nLook for signs of shock and estimate the amount of blood loss [77].\nThe secondary assessment involves assessing all areas using DCAP-BTLS [78].\nCheck the head for uncontrolled bleeding from scalp lacerations [79].\nFeel all four abdominal quadrants for tenderness or rigidity [80].\nRecord pulse, motor, and sensory functions in the extremities [81].\nRecord vital signs [81].\nWith critically injured patients or short transport times, a full secondary assessment\nmay not be possible [82].\nReassessment is done frequently, especially in areas with abnormal findings [83].\nReassess unstable patients every 5 minutes and stable patients every 15 minutes [83].\nInterventions include high-flow oxygen, controlling external bleeding, treating for\nshock, and rapid transport [84].\nIf internal bleeding is suspected, provide high-flow oxygen and rapid transport [85].\nDo not delay transport to complete assessments [86].\n7. Emergency Care for External Bleeding\nMethod Application Notes\nDirect Pressure Apply glove fingertip\nor hand over sterile\ndressing [94]\nMost common and effective method [92].\nApply pressure for at least 5 minutes [95].\nPressure Dressing Wrap sterile, selfadhering\nroller\nbandage around\nwound [96]\nStretch tight enough to control bleeding [96].\nShould still feel distal pulse [97]. Do not\nremove until physician evaluates [98]. Add\nmore dressings if bleeds through [99].\nTourniquets Apply above the\nlevel of bleeding\n[100]\nUseful for substantial extremity bleeding not\ncontrolled by direct pressure [99]. If not\npossible, consider additional tourniquet or\nwound packing [100]. Follow skill drill 26-3 [108].\nHemostatic\nDressing/Wound\nPacking\nPack gauze or\ndressing into larger\nwounds [103]\nUsed when direct pressure is inadequate or\ntourniquet is not possible [103]. Hemostatic\ndressing has chemical to promote clot\nformation [104]. Can be used with wound\npacking and direct pressure [105]. Follow skill\ndrill 26-2 [106].\nJunctional\nTourniquets\nApply for proximal\ncompression in\nareas like groin or\naxilla [108]\nFor severe hemorrhage at the junction of\ntorso with arms/legs [109]. Pelvic binder is a\ntype [109].\nAir Splints Apply to entire\nextremity [109]\nControls internal and external bleeding with\nsevere extremity injuries [109]. Immobilizes\nfractures [109]. Acts like a pressure dressing\n[109].\nPelvic Binder Apply for suspected\nclosed unstable\npelvic fracture [110]\nHelps control internal bleeding, especially\nwith life-threatening open-book pelvic\nfracture [111].\nFollow standard precautions when providing emergency care for external bleeding\n[88].\nWear a mask, gloves, eye protection, and sometimes a gown [88].\nEnsure the patient has an open airway and is breathing adequately [89].\nProvide high-flow oxygen [90].\nIf obvious life-threatening bleeding is present, control it quickly [90].\nSeveral methods exist to control external bleeding [91].\nThese include direct pressure, pressure dressings, tourniquets, hemostatic\ndressing, and wound packing [91].\nDirect pressure is the most common and effective method [92].\nPressure stops blood flow and allows normal coagulation [93].\nApply pressure with a gloved fingertip or hand over a sterile dressing [94].\nFor a protruding object, stabilize it with bulky dressing and apply pressure [95].\nHold uninterrupted pressure for at least five minutes [95].\nA pressure dressing involves wrapping a sterile, self-adhering bandage firmly around\nthe wound [96].\nStretch the bandage tightly enough to control bleeding [96].\nYou should still feel a distal pulse after applying the dressing [97].\nDo not remove the dressing until a physician has evaluated the patient [98].\nAdd more dressings if the first one bleeds through [99].\nA tourniquet is useful for substantial extremity bleeding not controlled by direct\npressure [99].\nApply the tourniquet above the level of bleeding [100].\nIf a single tourniquet is not possible, consider an additional one or wound packing [100].\nFollow the skill drill for applying a commercial tourniquet [108].\nWound packing uses gauze packed into larger wounds [103].\nThis is done when direct pressure is inadequate or a tourniquet is not possible [103].\nA hemostatic dressing is impregnated with a chemical that promotes clot formation\n[104].\nIt can be used with wound packing and direct pressure [105].\nFollow the skill drill for wound packing [106].\njunctional tourniquets provide proximal compression for bleeding in areas like the\ngroin or axilla [108].\nThey are indicated for severe hemorrhage at the junction of the torso with limbs [109].\nA pelvic binder is a type of junctional tourniquet [109].\nair splints can control internal and external bleeding associated with severe extremity\ninjuries [109].\nThey also immobilize fractures and act as a pressure dressing for an entire extremity\n[109].\nA pelvic binder is indicated for suspected closed unstable pelvic fractures [110].\nIt helps control internal bleeding from open-book pelvic fractures [111].\n8. Emergency Care for Internal Bleeding and Special Cases\nControlling internal bleeding or bleeding from a major organ usually requires surgery\nor other hospital procedures [120].\nTry to keep the patient calm, reassured, and quiet [120].\nProvide high-flow oxygen [121].\nMaintain the patient's body temperature [121].\nSplint the injured extremity, usually with an air splint [121].\nNever use a tourniquet to control bleeding from a closed internal or soft tissue injury\n[121].\nFollow the skill drill for caring for patients with internal bleeding [121].\nBleeding from the nose, ears, or mouth can result from several conditions [112].\nThese include skull fracture, facial injury, sinusitis, infection, nose drop abuse, dried\nnasal mucosa, high blood pressure, coagulation disorders, digital trauma, or cancer\n[112].\nEpistaxis (nosebleed) is a common emergency [114].\nIt can occasionally cause enough blood loss to lead to shock [114].\nMuch of the blood may pass down the throat into the stomach [115].\nSwallowing a large amount of blood can cause nausea and vomiting [115].\nMost non-traumatic nosebleeds occur from sites in the septum [115].\nPinching the nostrils together is usually effective for this type of bleeding [115].\nBleeding from the nose or ears after a head injury may indicate a skull fracture [116].\nThis type of bleeding may be difficult to control [116].\nDo not attempt to stop this blood flow by applying excessive pressure [116].\nExcessive pressure may force blood to collect in the head [116].\nLoosely cover the bleeding site with a sterile gauze pad to collect blood [117].\nThis also keeps contaminants away [117].\nApply light compression by wrapping a bulky dressing around the head [118].\nA target or halo shaped stain on the dressing may indicate the presence of\ncerebrospinal fluid [119].\n9. Communication and Documentation\nDo not delay transport of any patient to complete assessments [86].\nIt is essential to communicate and document in bleeding emergencies [86].\nRecognize, estimate, and report the amount of blood loss [86].\nReport how rapidly the bleeding occurred [87].\nCommunicate all relevant information to the staff at the receiving hospital [87].\nThis includes all injuries, the care provided, and the patient's response [87].\n10. Conclusion and Review\nWhat is not a component of the cardiovascular system? The lungs are part of the\nrespiratory system [123].\nHow is perfusion most accurately defined? It is the circulation of enough oxygen and\nnutrients in significant amounts [124].\nWhich injury is the highest treatment priority for a man in a motorcycle crash with\nmultiple abrasions and lacerations? A one-inch laceration on the thigh squirting blood\n(arterial bleeding) is the highest priority [126].\nWhich set of vital signs is least indicative of internal bleeding? Vital signs that do not\nshow significant changes are least indicative [128].\nWhen caring for a patient with internal bleeding, what must the EMT do first? The EMT\nmust first take appropriate standard precautions [129].\nWhat is the quickest and most effective way to control external bleeding from an\nextremity? Direct pressure is the quickest and most effective way [130].\nWhen applying a tourniquet to an amputated arm, what should the EMT do? The EMT\nshould avoid applying it over a joint [131].\nWhat is the most likely contributing factor to a nosebleed in a 70-year-old man with a\nhistory of cardiac issues and high blood pressure? High blood pressure is the most\nlikely contributing factor [132].\nWhen caring for epistaxis, what is the most effective way to prevent aspiration of\nblood? Leaning the patient forward and tilting them forward is most effective [135].\nWhat does controlling internal bleeding typically require? Controlling internal bleeding\nusually requires surgical intervention [136].\nThis concludes the chapter on bleeding [137].",
