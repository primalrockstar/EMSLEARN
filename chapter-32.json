Introduction to Orthopedic Injuries and the Musculoskeletal\nSystem\northopedic injuries are a common reason for seeking medical attention [7].\nThese injuries often cause pain, swelling, and deformity [8].\nWhile rarely fatal, musculoskeletal injuries can result in short or long-term\ndisability [9].\nThe musculoskeletal system provides form, upright posture, and movement [5]\n.\nIt also protects vital internal organs [6].\nThe body has three types of muscles: skeletal, smooth, and cardiac [12].\nSkeletal muscles are also called striated muscle due to their stripes [13].\nThey attach to bones and usually cross at least one joint [13].\nThey are voluntary muscles under direct control of the voluntary\nsystem [14].\nSkeletal muscles make up the largest portion of the body's muscle\nmass [16].\nThey are supplied with arteries, veins, and nerves [17].\nSkeletal muscle tissue attaches directly to bone by tendons [18].\nSmooth muscle is involuntary and performs much of the body's\nautonomic work [19].\nFound in the walls of most tubular structures, they control the\nmovement of contents within these structures by contracting and\nrelaxing [20].\nCardiac muscle is a specially adapted involuntary muscle with its own\nregulatory system [22].\nThe skeleton gives recognizable human form, protects vital internal\norgans, and allows movement [24].\nIt consists of approximately 206 bones [25].\nBones produce red blood cells in the bone marrow [26].\nThey also serve as a reservoir for important minerals and electrolytes [26].\nSystem\nComponent\nKey Function Associated Structure/Example\nSkeletal Muscle Movement, Posture, Form Attaches to bones by tendons,\nlargest muscle mass\nSmooth Muscle Autonomic work,\nMovement of contents\nWalls of tubular structures (e.g.,\nblood vessels)\nCardiac Muscle Involuntary muscle with\nregulatory system\nHeart\nSkeletal System Form, Protection,\nMovement, Blood\nProduction\nApproximately 206 bones,\nproduces red blood cells\n2. Anatomy of the Skeletal System\nThe skull is a solid, vault-like structure protecting the brain [28].\nThe thoracic cage protects the heart, lungs, and great vessels [29].\nThe lower ribs protect the liver and spleen [30].\nThe bony spinal canal encases and protects the spinal cord [30].\nThe pectoral or shoulder girdle consists of two scapula and two clavicles [30]\n.\nThe scapula (shoulder blade) is a flat, triangular bone held to the rib cage\nby powerful muscles [31].\nThe clavicle (collarbone) is a slender s-shaped bone attached to the\nsternum and acromion process by ligaments [31].\nThe clavicle is vulnerable to injury because it is slender and exposed [33].\nThe upper extremities extend from the shoulder to the fingertips [35].\nThey are composed of the upper arm (humerus), elbow, and forearm\n(radius and ulna) [35].\nThe humerus joins the shoulder girdle at the joint [36].\nThe humerus connects to the forearm bones to form a hinged elbow joint\n[36].\nThe hand contains three sets of bones: carpals (wrist bones), metacarpals\n(hand bones), and phalanges (finger bones) [37].\nThe pelvis supports body weight and protects structures like the bladder,\nrectum, and female reproductive organs [38].\nThe pelvic girdle is three fused bones (ilium, ischium, and pubis) forming\nthe hip joint [39].\nThe lower extremities consist of bones of the thigh, leg, and foot [40].\nThe femur (thigh bone) is a long, powerful bone [41].\nIt connects to the pelvis in a ball and socket joint and to the knees in a\nhinged joint [42].\nThe lower leg consists of two bones: the tibia and fibula [42].\nThe foot consists of three classes of bones: tarsals (ankle joints),\nmetatarsals (foot bones), and phalanges (toe bones) [43].\n3. Joints and Mechanisms of Injury\nA joint is formed where two bones come into contact [46].\nJoints are held together by a tough fibrous capsule [46].\nThe capsule is supported and strengthened by bands of fibrous tissues called\nligaments [47].\nIn moving joints, bone ends are covered with articular cartilage [48].\nJoints are bathed and lubricated by synovial fluid [49].\nJoints allow different motions:\nCircular motion (e.g., shoulder joint) [49].\nHinge motion (e.g., elbow and knee) [49].\nMinimal motion (e.g., sternoclavicular joints) [49].\nNo motion (e.g., sutures in the skull) [49].\nSignificant force is generally required to cause fractures and dislocations [51].\nForces can include direct blows, indirect forces, twisting forces, or high\nenergy forces [51].\nA slight force can fracture a bone weakened by a tumor, infection, or\nosteoporosis [52].\nSuspect a fracture in an older patient reporting pain after a mild injury [53].\nType of\nJoint\nExample Motion Allowed Supporting\nStructure\nBall and\nSocket\nShoulder, Hip Circular motion Capsule,\nLigaments\nHinge Elbow, Knee Hinge motion (bending and\nstraightening)\nCapsule,\nLigaments\nMinimal\nMotion\nSternoclavicular Limited movement Ligaments\nNo Motion Sutures (Skull) No movement Capsule\n4. Types of Musculoskeletal Injuries: Fractures\nA fracture is a break in the continuity of the bone [54].\nfractures often occur due to an external force [54].\nfractures are classified as either open or closed [55].\nAn open fracture has an external wound [55].\nThe wound can be caused by the initial blow or by the broken bone\nlacerating the skin [55].\nTreat any injury that breaks the skin as a possible open fracture [56].\nComplications of open fractures include increased blood loss and a higher\nlikelihood of infection [57].\nfractures are also described by whether the bone has moved from its normal\nposition [58].\nA non-displaced fracture, or hairline fracture, is a simple crack [59].\nIt can be difficult to distinguish from a sprain or contusion [59].\nA displaced fracture produces deformity by shortening, rotating, or\nangulating the limb [60].\nSpecific types of fractures include:\nGreenstick fracture: Incomplete fracture passing partly through the bone\nshaft [61].\nOblique fracture: Bone broken at an angle across the bone [61].\nPathologic fracture: Fracture of a weakened or diseased bone by minimal\nforce [61].\nIncomplete fracture: Does not run completely through the bone [61].\nComminuted fracture: Bone broken into more than two fragments [62].\nEpiphyseal fracture: Occurs in the growth section of a child's bone,\npotentially leading to growth abnormalities [63].\nSpiral fracture: Caused by twisting force, creating an oblique fracture\naround and through the bone [66].\nTransverse fracture: Occurs straight across the bone [66].\nSuspect a fracture if these signs and symptoms are present [67]:\nDeformity or tenderness [68].\nGuarding or swelling [68].\nBruising [68].\ncrepitus (grating sound or sensation) [68].\nfalse motion (movement where there shouldn't be) [68].\nExposed fragments [68].\nPain [68].\nA locked joint [68].\n5. Types of Musculoskeletal Injuries: Dislocations, Sprains,\nStrains, and Amputations\nA dislocation is a disruption of a joint where bone ends are no longer in\ncontact [70].\nSupporting ligaments are often torn, allowing bone ends to separate [71].\nA fracture dislocation is a combination injury with a dislocated joint and a\nfracture of bone ends [72].\nSome dislocated joints may spontaneously reduce before assessment [73].\nHistory taking can help confirm a spontaneously reduced dislocation [74].\nA dislocation that doesn't reduce is a serious problem [75].\nCommonly dislocated joints include fingers, shoulders, elbows, and knees [76].\nSigns and symptoms of a dislocated joint are similar to fractures [77]:\nMarked deformity [77].\nSwelling [77].\nPain aggravated by movement attempts [77].\nTenderness on palpation [77].\nVirtually complete loss of normal joint motion (locked joint) [77].\nNumbness or impaired circulation [77].\nA sprain occurs when a joint is twisted or stretched beyond its normal range\nof motion [78].\nSupporting capsular and ligaments are stretched or torn [78].\nsprains range from mild to severe [79].\nThe most vulnerable joints are knees, shoulders, and ankles [79].\nAfter injury, alignment generally returns to near normal [80].\nSigns and symptoms of sprains include guarding, swelling, ecchymosis, pain,\nor joint instability [81].\nA strain is basically a pulled muscle [82].\nIt involves stretching or tearing of the muscle [82].\nStrains cause pain, swelling, and bruising of soft tissues [83].\nUnlike a sprain, typically no ligament or joint damage occurs [84].\nOften, no deformity is present, and only minor swelling is noted [85].\nMost patients will have extreme point tenderness with a strain [86].\nAn amputation is an injury where an extremity is completely severed [88].\nAmputations can damage every aspect of the musculoskeletal system [89].\nInjury\nType\nDefinition Key Characteristics Associated\nSigns/Symptoms\nDislocation Disruption of a joint,\nbone ends lose\ncontact\nSupporting\nligaments often torn,\npotential for\nspontaneous\nreduction\nMarked deformity,\nswelling, pain,\ntenderness, locked\njoint\nSprain Joint\ntwisted/stretched\nbeyond normal\nrange of motion\nSupporting\nligaments\nstretched/torn,\nrange from mild to\nsevere\nGuarding, swelling,\nbruising, pain, joint\ninstability\nStrain Stretching or tearing\nof a muscle (pulled\nmuscle)\nNo ligament/joint\ndamage typical,\nminor swelling\nPain, swelling,\nbruising, extreme\npoint tenderness\nAmputation Complete severance\nof an extremity\nDamages bone,\nligament, and\nmuscle\nSevere bleeding,\nshock, absence of a\nlimb (obvious)\n6. Complications of Musculoskeletal Injuries\northopedic injuries can lead to numerous complications [91].\nComplications are not limited to the musculoskeletal system [91].\nSystematic changes or illness can occur [91].\nThe likelihood of complications is related to the force of injury, location, and\npatient's overall health [92].\nTo prevent contamination in open fractures, brush away obvious debris on the\nskin [94].\nDo not enter or probe an open fractured site before applying a dressing [96].\nPreventing further injury helps reduce the risk of long-term disability [97].\nReducing the risk of wound infection also helps reduce long-term disability\n[97].\nTransporting patients to the appropriate medical facility contributes to\nreducing long-term disability [97].\n7. Assessing the Severity of Injury and Patient Assessment\nThe \"golden period\" is critical for preserving limb viability in extremities with\nless than complete circulation [99].\nProlonged hypoperfusion can cause significant damage [100].\nAny suspected open fracture or vascular injury is considered a critical\nemergency [101].\nMost injuries are not critical [102].\nAlways look at the big picture when assessing patients [105].\nEvaluate the overall situation to determine and treat any life threats [105].\nDistinguish mild injuries from severe injuries [106].\nSome severe injuries may compromise neurovascular function, threatening\nlong-term function [106].\nScene size-up is crucial [109].\nScene safety is the number one priority [109].\nIdentify forces associated with the mechanism of injury [109].\nStandard precautions like gloves may be needed [110].\nA mask and gown may be necessary [110].\nConsider the possibility of hidden bleeding [111].\nEvaluate the need for law enforcement, advanced life support, or\nadditional ambulances [112].\nBe alert for primary and secondary injuries based on the mechanism of injury\n[113].\nThe primary assessment focuses on identifying and managing life threats\n[114].\nTreat the patient according to their level of consciousness [114].\nEx-ABCs are always a priority (Exsanguination, Airway, Breathing,\nCirculation) [114].\nCheck for responsiveness using the AVPU scale [115].\nConsider high flow oxygen for patients with less than alert and oriented\nconsciousness [115].\nMusculoskeletal injuries may be lower priority if significant trauma affects\nmultiple body systems [116].\nfractures and sprains usually don't cause airway or breathing problems\n[117].\nFocus on determining if the patient has a pulse, adequate perfusion, or is\nbleeding [118].\nTreat the patient for shock immediately if skin is pale, cool, or clammy, or\ncapillary refill is slow [119].\nMaintain a normal body temperature [120].\nStabilize extremity injuries before moving the patient [120].\nTransport decisions depend on the patient's condition and mechanism of\ninjury [121].\nProvide rapid transport for patients with airway/breathing problems or\nsignificant bleeding [121].\nPatients with a significant mechanism of injury, but otherwise stable,\nshould be transported promptly [122].\nFor rapid transport with a significant mechanism, a backboard can splint\nthe whole body [123].\nPatients with a simple mechanism can be assessed and stabilized on\nscene if no other problems exist [124].\nAssessment\nStep\nFocus Key Actions\nScene Size-Up Safety, Mechanism of\nInjury\nScene safety, identify forces,\nconsider standard precautions,\nhidden bleeding\nPrimary\nAssessment\nIdentifying/Managing Life\nThreats\nEx-ABCs priority, check\nresponsiveness, consider oxygen,\nevaluate circulation\nShock\nManagement\nTreating inadequate\nperfusion\nTreat immediately if signs\npresent, maintain temperature\nStabilization\n(Extremities)\nPreparing for transport Stabilize injuries before moving\nthe patient\nTransport\nDecision\nDetermining urgency and\nmethod of transport\nRapid transport for life\nthreats/significant MOI,\nbackboard for whole body splint\n8. History Taking and Secondary Assessment\nObtain a medical history and be alert for injury-specific signs, symptoms,\nand pertinent negatives [128].\nObtain a sample history for all trauma patients [129].\nThe detail of the history depends on the patient's condition and transport\nurgency [130].\nOPQRST can be of limited use and too lengthy in severe injury cases [131].\nRapid transport requires immediate attention to airway, breathing, or\ncirculation [133].\nThe secondary assessment involves a physical exam [135].\nIf significant trauma affects multiple systems, perform a head-to-toe\nassessment [135].\nWork systematically from head to feet, checking the head, chest, abdomen,\nextremities, and back [136].\nThe goal is to identify hidden and potentially life-threatening injuries [137].\nUse the DCAP-BTLS approach to assess the musculoskeletal system [137].\nConsider an open fracture when lacerations are present in an extremity [138].\nBleeding control and dressings must be applied [139].\nInjury or deformity of a bone may be associated with vessel or nerve injury\n[140].\nObtain a baseline neurovascular assessment [141].\nAlways recheck neurovascular function before splinting or manipulating a limb\n[141].\nExamination of an injured limb should include the Six P's of musculoskeletal\nassessment [142]:\nPain [143].\nParalysis [143].\nparesthesia (numbness or tingling) [143].\nPulselessness [143].\nPallor (not power) [143].\nPressure [143].\nDetermine a baseline set of vital signs [143].\n9. Reassessment and Documentation\nReassessment is crucial to ensure interventions are working [144].\nPerform reassessment every five minutes for unstable patients [145].\nPerform reassessment every fifteen minutes for stable patients [145].\nDuring reassessment, assess the patient's overall condition [146].\nStabilize the XABCs [146].\nControl any serious bleeding in critically injured patients [147].\nSecure critically injured patients to a long backboard for prompt transport to a\ntrauma center [148].\nIn critical situations, a secondary assessment may be a waste of valuable time\n[149].\nReassess the patient en route to the emergency department [150].\nIf the patient has no life-threatening injuries, take time on scene to stabilize\ntheir condition [150].\nApply a secure splint after assessing the extremity for non-life-threatening\ninjuries [151].\nSplinting should be done prior to transport [152].\nCommunication and documentation are vital [152].\nDocument complete descriptions of injuries and associated mechanisms of\ninjury [152].\nDocument the presence or absence of circulation, motor function, or\nsensation distal to the injured extremity [153].\nDocument neurovascular status after manipulation or splinting [153].\nDocument neurovascular status on arrival at the hospital [153].\nPatient\nStability\nReassessment\nFrequency\nKey Actions During Reassessment\nUnstable Every 5 minutes Assess overall condition, stabilize\nXABCs, control bleeding\nStable Every 15 minutes Assess overall condition, stabilize\nXABCs, control bleeding\n10. Emergency Medical Care and Splinting Principles\nEmergency care for musculoskeletal injuries involves performing a primary\nassessment [155].\nStabilize the patient's ABCs if needed [155].\nPerform a secondary assessment of the entire body or specific injured area\n[156].\nBe alert for signs and symptoms of internal bleeding [157].\nFollow specific skill drill steps when caring for these patients [157].\nA splint is a flexible or rigid device protecting and maintaining the position of\nan injured extremity [158].\nSplint fractures, dislocations, and sprains before moving the patient, unless\nlife is in immediate danger [159].\nSplinting reduces pain and makes transport easier [160].\nSplinting helps prevent [161]:\nFurther damage to muscles, spinal cord, nerves, and blood vessels from\nbroken bone ends [161].\nLaceration of skin by broken bones [162].\nRestriction of blood vessel flow from pressure of bone ends [162].\nExcessive bleeding from tissues at the injury site [162].\nIncreased pain from bone movement [162].\nParalysis of extremities [162].\nGeneral principles of splinting [163]:\nRemove clothing from the suspected fracture/dislocation area to inspect\nfor DCAP-BTLS [163].\nNote and record neurovascular status distal to the injury (pulse, sensation,\nmovement) [164].\nCover open wounds with dry, sterile dressings before splinting [165].\nDo not move the patient before splinting unless there's immediate danger\nor uncorrected life threats [166].\nFor a suspected fracture of a bone shaft, stabilize the joints above and\nbelow the fracture [167].\nFor injuries in and around a joint, stabilize the bones above and below the\ninjured joint [167].\nPad all rigid splints to prevent local pressure and discomfort [168].\nMaintain manual stabilization while applying the splint to minimize limb\nmovement [169].\nSupport the injury site [169].\nUse constant gentle manual traction to align a severely deformed long\nbone shaft fracture for splinting [170].\nIf encountering resistance or pain during alignment, splint the limb in its\ndeformed position [171].\nImmobilize suspected spinal injuries in a neutral inline position on a\nbackboard [172].\nIf the patient shows signs of shock, align the limb in the normal atomic\nposition and transport [172].\nWhen in doubt, splint [173].\n11. Types of Splints and Hazards of Improper Splinting\nRigid splints are non-formable and made of firm material [174].\nThey are applied to the sides, front, and back of an injured extremity to\nprevent motion [175].\nSplint a limb in the position of deformity if the deformity is severe or if you\nencounter resistance/pain during gentle traction of a shaft fracture [176].\nFormable splints include SAM splints and vacuum splints [177].\nSAM splint stands for structural aluminum manual splint [177].\nOther examples are air splints, pillow splints, and sling and swathe splints\n[179].\nA vacuum splint can be shaped around a deformed limb [180].\nAir is pulled out of a vacuum splint using a hand pump [181].\nPelvic binders are used to splint the bony pelvis [183].\nThey reduce hemorrhage from bone ends and venous disruption [184].\nPelvic binders also help reduce pain [184].\nHazards of improper splinting [186]:\nCompression can injure nerves, tissues, and blood vessels [186].\nImproper splinting can delay transport for patients with life-threatening\ninjuries [187].\nIt can reduce distal circulation [187].\nImproper splinting can aggravate the injury [187].\nExcessive movement of the bone or joint can injure tissues, nerves, blood\nvessels, or muscles [187].\nSplint Type Characteristics Common Use\nCases\nPotential Hazards of\nImproper Use\nRigid Splint Non-formable, firm\nmaterial, prevents\nmotion\nApplied to\nsides/front/back of\nextremity\nCompression,\nnerve/tissue/vessel\ninjury\nFormable\nSplint\nFlexible, can be\nmolded (SAM,\nvacuum, air, pillow)\nAround deformed\nlimbs, various\nextremity injuries\nReduced circulation,\naggravated injury\nPelvic\nBinder\nSecures bony pelvis Pelvic fractures Delayed transport,\nfurther injury\n12. Transportation Considerations\nVery few musculoskeletal injuries justify excessive speed during transport\n[189].\nA patient with a pulseless limb must be given high priority [190].\nIf the treatment facility is an hour or more away, transport a patient with a\npulseless limb by helicopter or immediate ground transport [190].\n13. Specific Musculoskeletal Injuries: Upper Extremities\nclavicle (collar bone) fractures are among the most common bone fractures\n[191].\nCommon in children falling with an outstretched hand [192].\nPatients report pain in the shoulder and hold the arm across the body [192].\nSwelling and point tenderness occur over the clavicle [193].\nclavicle fractures may lead to neurovascular compromise due to nearby\nvessels and nerves [194].\nscapula (shoulder blade) fractures are less frequent due to muscle\nprotection [195].\nAlmost always result from forceful direct blows to the back over the\nscapula [195].\nAssociated chest injuries pose the greatest threat, not the fracture itself\n[196].\nAbrasions, contusions, and significant pain occur [198].\nPatients limit arm use due to pain [198].\nAcromioclavicular (AC) joint separation occurs at the joint below the\nclavicle and scapula's acromion process [199].\nFrequently separated during sports when falling on the point of the\nshoulder [200].\nclavicle and scapula fractures can be splinted with a sling and swath [201].\nShoulder dislocations most commonly occur anteriorly [203].\nResult from forceful adduction and external rotation [203].\nShoulder dislocations are extremely painful [204].\nPatients may report hand numbness due to nervous or circulatory\ncompromise [204].\nStabilizing an anterior shoulder dislocation is difficult as moving the arm\ntowards the chest wall causes pain [205].\nSplint the joint in the position most comfortable for the patient [205].\nSling the forearm and wrist to support the arm's weight [206].\nSecure the arm in a sling to a pillow and chest with a swath [206].\nTransport the patient seated or semi-seated [207].\nhumerus fractures occur proximally, mid-shaft, or distally at the elbow [209].\nConsider applying traction to realign severely angulated fractures before\nsplinting [210].\nSupport the fracture site and gently pull the humeral condyles in line with\nthe limb's normal axis [211].\nSplint the arm with a sling and swath and a padded board splint on the\nlateral aspect [213].\nElbow injuries (fractures and dislocations) are often difficult to distinguish\nwithout X-rays [214].\nThey produce similar deformities and require the same emergency care\n[215].\nDistal humerus fractures (supracondylar/intracondylar) are common in\nchildren [216].\nFracture fragments often rotate, injuring vessels and nerves [217].\nSwelling occurs rapidly and is severe [218].\nElbow dislocations occur in athletes and rarely young children [219].\nThe ulna and radius are often displaced posteriorly relative to the\nhumerus [219].\nThere is swelling and potential for vessel/nerve injuries [220].\nFracture of the olecranon process of the ulna results from direct or\nindirect forces [221].\nOften associated with lacerations and abrasions [221].\nPatients cannot actively extend the elbow [221].\nfractures of the radial head are often missed [222].\nGenerally occur from a fall on an outstretched arm or direct blow to the\nlateral elbow [222].\nAttempting to rotate the elbow or wrist causes discomfort [223].\nCare for elbow injuries requires careful management [224].\nAssess distal neurovascular function periodically [225].\nIf pulses and cap refill are good, splint the elbow in the position found,\nadding a wrist sling if helpful [226].\nA cold, pale hand, weak/absent pulse, or poor cap refill indicates likely\nblood vessel injury [227].\nIf the limb is pulseless and severely deformed at the elbow, apply\ngentle manual traction to decrease deformity and provide prompt\ntransport [229].\nForearm fractures are seen most often in children and older people [230].\nUsually, both radius and ulna break from a fall on an outstretched hand\n[230].\nIsolated ulna shaft fractures can occur from a direct blow (nightstick\nfracture) [232].\nDistal radius fractures (Colles' fracture) are common in elderly patients\nwith osteoporosis [233].\nStabilize forearm and wrist fractures with padded board, air vacuum, or\npillow splints [234].\nWrist and hand injuries often involve dislocations associated with fractures\n(fracture dislocation) [236].\nAn isolated, non-displaced carpal bone fracture (scaphoid) is also\ncommon [237].\nImproper treatment can lead to permanent disability and deformity due to\nintricate function [238].\nFollow skill drill steps to splint the hand and wrist [239].\nUpper\nExtremity\nArea\nCommon Injuries Key\nCharacteristics\nManagement\nConsiderations\nClavicle Fracture

Specific Musculoskeletal Injuries: Pelvis and Lower Extremities\nPelvis fractures often result from direct compression (heavy blow) [240].\nMay be accompanied by life-threatening blood loss from lacerated vessels\n[242].\nSeveral liters of blood can drain into the pelvic and retroperitoneal space\n[243].\nCan result in significant hypotension, shock, and death [246].\nPelvic fractures can lacerate the rectum, vagina, and bladder [248].\nSuspect in patients with high velocity injury and lower back or abdomen\ndiscomfort [249].\nDeformity or swelling may be hard to see [252].\nThe most reliable sign is tenderness or instability on compression and\npalpation [253].\nStabilize isolated pelvic fractures in stable patients with a long backboard\nor scoop stretcher [255].\nHip dislocations involve a very stable ball and socket joint [257].\nDislocate only after significant injury [258].\nMost are posterior, often from a motor vehicle crash driving the femur\nposteriorly [259].\nAssociated with distinctive signs: severe pain, resistance to movement,\ntenderness, palpation of femoral head in buttocks [260].\nDo not attempt to reduce a dislocated hip in the field unless directed by\nmedical control [261].\nSplint the dislocation in the position of deformity [262].\nPlace the patient supine on a long backboard [262].\nSupport the affected limb with pillows/blankets to secure it to the\nbackboard [263].\nProximal femur fractures are common, especially in older people and those\nwith osteoporosis [264].\nThe break goes through the neck or proximal shaft of the femur [264].\nPatients have characteristic deformity: externally rotated leg, injured limb\nshorter than the uninjured [266].\nUnable to walk or move the leg [267].\nHip region is tender on palpation [267].\nGentle rolling causes pain but no further damage [267].\nAssess the pelvis for soft tissue injury [268].\nBandage, splint the lower extremity, and transport [268].\nSignificant blood loss is possible; treat with high flow oxygen, monitor vital\nsigns, and watch for shock [270].\nFemoral shaft fractures can occur anywhere from the hip to the knee [271].\nLarge thigh muscles spasm, attempting to splint the unstable limb [272].\nMuscle spasm produces significant limb deformity [272].\nfractures may be open, with significant blood loss [273].\nHypovolemic shock is not unusual due to severe deformity [273].\nBone fragments may penetrate or press on nerves and vessels, causing\ndamage [274].\nCarefully and periodically assess distal neurovascular function [274].\nCover wounds with a dry, sterile dressing [275].\nBest stabilized with a traction splint (e.g., Sager splint) [275].\nTraction splints secure femur shaft fractures characterized by pain,\nswelling, and mid-thigh deformity [278].\nExcessive traction can harm an uninjured limb [279].\nGoals of inline traction: stabilize fragments, prevent excessive movement,\nalign limb for splinting, avoid neurovascular compromise [280].\nDo NOT use a traction splint for upper extremity injuries, injuries\nnear/involving the knee, pelvic injuries, partial amputations with bone\nseparation, or lower leg/foot/ankle injuries [282].\nKnee ligament injuries are common as the knee is vulnerable [286].\nRange from mild sprains to complete dislocations [287].\nOccur when abnormal bending and twisting forces are applied [288].\nPatient reports joint pain and cannot use the extremity normally [289].\nSwelling, bruising, tenderness, and fluid in the joint are generally present\n[289].\nSplint all suspected knee ligament injuries [290].\nThe splint should extend from the hip joint to the foot [291].\nStabilize the bone with the injured joint and the bone below it [292].\nVarious splints can be used, including padded rigid long leg splints or two\npadded board splints [293].\nKnee dislocations are true emergencies that may threaten the limb [294].\nLigaments providing support may be damaged or torn [295].\nAlways check distal circulation carefully before other steps [296].\nDirection of dislocation refers to the tibia's position relative to the femur\n[297].\nPosterior knee dislocations are most common [298].\nMedial dislocations result from a direct blow to the lateral leg [299].\nPatients complain of knee pain and report the knee \"gave out\" [300].\nComplications include limb-threatening popliteal artery disruption, nerve\ninjuries, and joint instability [301].\nIf adequate distal pulses are present, splint the knee in the position found\nand transport promptly [302].\nMedical control may instruct you to attempt realigning a deformed,\npulseless limb to reduce popliteal artery compression and restore\ncirculation [303].\nfractures about the knee occur at the distal femur, proximal tibia, or patella\n[305].\nIf adequate distal pulses are present and no significant deformity, splint\nthe limb with the knee straight [306].\nIf an adequate pulse is present with significant deformity, splint the knee in\nthe position of deformity [307].\nIf the pulse is absent below the injury, suspect vascular/nerve damage and\ncontact medical control [308].\nNever use a traction splint if a knee fracture is suspected [309].\nDislocation of the patella usually displaces to the lateral side [310].\nProduces significant deformity: knee held moderately flexed, patella\ndisplaced laterally [312].\nSplint the knee in the position found (often moderately flexed) [313].\nApply padded board splints to medial and lateral aspects, extending from\nhip to ankle [314].\ntibia and fibula injuries involve fractures of the shaft between the knee and\nankle [316].\nOften both bones are fractured simultaneously [316].\nEven a single fracture can cause severe deformity (angulation or rotation)\n[316].\ntibial fractures are relatively common [317].\nStabilize with padded rigid long leg splints or an air splint from foot to\nupper thigh [317].\nCorrect severe deformity with gentle longitudinal traction before splinting\n[319].\nAnkle injuries are common [320].\nRange from simple sprains to severe fracture dislocations [320].\nInjuries causing pain, swelling, localized tenderness, or inability to bear\nweight require physician evaluation [321].\nThe most frequent mechanism is twisting, stretching or tearing ligaments\n[322].\nManage ankle injuries: dress open wounds, assess distal neurovascular\nfunction, correct gross deformity with gentle longitudinal traction to the\nheel, then apply splint [324].\nFoot injuries can result in dislocation or fracture of tarsals, metatarsals, or\nphalanges [325].\nForce of injury can transmit up the leg, causing a lumbar spine fracture\n[325].\nIf foot dislocation is suspected, immediately assess pulses, motor, and\nsensory functions [326].\nIf a pulse is present, immobilize the extremity with a splint, leaving toes\nexposed for neurovascular assessment [327].\nIf pulses are absent, contact medical control [328].\nFoot injuries are associated with significant swelling but rarely gross\ndeformity [329].\nSplint the foot using a rigid padded board, air, or pillow splint, stabilizing\nthe ankle joint and foot [330].\nLeave toes exposed [331].\nElevate the foot about six inches to minimize swelling [333].\n15. Management of Sprains, Strains, Amputations, and\nCompartment Syndrome\nTreat every severe sprain as if it's a fracture [335].\nGeneral treatment for sprains and strains includes the RICE protocol [336]:\nRest [337].\nIce [337].\nCompression [337].\nElevation [337].\nSplinting [337].\nManagement of amputations [338]:\nControl bleeding and treat for shock [338].\nSurgeons can sometimes reattach amputated parts [339].\nFor partial amputations, immobilize the part with a bulky dressing and\nsplint [340].\nDo not sever any partial amputations [340].\nControl bleeding from the stump; apply a tourniquet if severe [341].\nFor complete amputations, wrap the clean part in a sterile dressing and\nplace it in a plastic bag [342].\nFollow local protocols for preserving amputated parts [343].\nKeep the part cool without freezing or causing frostbite [344].\nTransport the amputated part with the patient to the appropriate hospital\n[345].\nCompartment syndrome is a limb-threatening condition [346].\nCharacterized by local tissue swelling within a compartment [347].\nBlood flow decreases inside the muscle compartment, leading to ischemia\n[348].\nTissues become damaged and can die [350].\nDefinitive treatment is a surgical fasciotomy allowing swollen muscle to\nexpand [351].\nTypically develops 6-12 hours after injury from excessive bleeding,\ncrushed extremity, or rapid return of pulse to an ischemic limb [352].\nSigns and symptoms include pain out of proportion to the injury, pain on\npassive stretch, and altered sensation [353].\nAdditional signs may be pallor and decreased power [354].\nIf compartment syndrome is suspected, splint the affected limb level with\nthe heart [355].\nProvide immediate transport [355].\nReassess neurovascular status frequently during transport [356].\nInjury Type Management Protocol/Key Actions\nSprains and Strains RICE (Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation, Splinting), treat\nsevere sprains as fractures\nAmputations Control bleeding, treat for shock, immobilize partial\namputations, preserve complete amputations\nCompartment\nSyndrome\nSuspect based on pain out of proportion, splint limb level\nwith heart, immediate transport\n16. Review of Key Concepts\nSkeletal muscle is also referred to as striated muscle [357].\nA strain is stretching or tearing of the muscle, not ligaments with joint\ndislocation [358].\nIn an unresponsive patient with a musculoskeletal injury, you will not be able\nto assess sensory function (can you feel this?) [359].\nThe purpose of splinting a fracture is to prevent movement of bony fragments\nand reduce further injury [361].\nFor a conscious, restless patient with closed deformities to both mid-shaft\nfemurs, cool/clammy skin, and weak/rapid radial pulses, the most appropriate\nsplinting technique is securing him to a long backboard to act as a splint [362].\nTo effectively immobilize a fractured clavicle, you should use a sling and\nswath to minimize movement [364].\nWhen treating a patient with severe pain and obvious deformity to their elbow\nafter a fall, the very first thing to do is manually stabilize the injury and assess\nfor PMS (Pulse, Motor, Sensation) [366].\nWhen treating an open fracture, you should cover the wound to prevent\nfurther infection [369].\nOf the musculoskeletal injuries listed, pelvic fractures have the greatest risk\nfor shock due to blood loss because large vessels can be lacerated [370].\nFor an injured patient with a severely painful and deformed left knee that is\nflexed, but distal pulses are present and strong, the most appropriate\ntreatment is to splint the leg in the position it is found [373].",
