Introduction to Environmental Emergencies\nenvironmental emergencies occur when the body cannot cope with surrounding\nfactors like temperature and atmospheric pressure . These situations can lead to\nmedical emergencies . Certain groups are more vulnerable, including children, older\npeople, those with chronic illnesses, and young adults who overexert themselves .\nenvironmental emergencies often happen alongside other injuries or illnesses .\nExamples of these emergencies include heat and cold-related issues, water\nemergencies, pressure-related injuries from diving or altitude, and injuries from\nlightning strikes and venomous bites/stings .\n2. Cold-Related Emergencies: Physiology and Types\nWhen the body or a part of it is exposed to cold, the temperature regulation is\noverwhelmed . Cold exposure can injure the hands, feet, ears, nose, or the whole\nbody .\nMechanism of Heat\nLoss\nDescription\nConduction Transfer of heat by direct contact with a colder object\nConvection Transfer of heat to circulating air moving across the\nbody\nEvaporation Conversion of liquid to gas\nRadiation Transfer of heat by radiant energy\nRespiration Heat loss as warm air is exhaled and cool air is inhaled\nhypothermia happens when the body's core temperature falls below 95 degrees .\nThe body loses its ability to regulate temperature and generate heat . To protect\nagainst heat loss, blood vessels in the skin constrict, causing blue lips or fingertips .\nThe body shivers to generate heat . If these mechanisms fail, body functions slow,\nmental status declines, and vital organs like the heart slow down, which can lead to\ndeath . hypothermia can develop quickly, such as with cold water immersion . It can\noccur even when air temperature is not below freezing . Higher risk populations\ninclude homeless individuals, those without home heating, swimmers, geriatric and ill\npatients, and patients with specific medical conditions like burns, shock, head injury,\nstroke, generalized infections, spinal cord injuries, diabetes, and hypoglycemia .\nLocal cold injuries are usually confined to exposed body parts . frostnip and\nimmersion foot (trench foot) occur when parts are very cold but not frozen .\nfrostbite occurs when tissues are frozen . Severity depends on exposure duration,\ntemperature, and wind velocity . Factors like wet conditions, inadequate insulation,\nrestricted circulation, fatigue, poor nutrition, alcohol/drug abuse, hypothermia,\ndiabetes, cardiovascular disease, and age also play a role . Patients with hypothermia\nshould be checked for frostbite and other local cold injuries .\nfrostnip: Cold skin freezes, but deeper tissues are unaffected. It often affects\nthe ears, nose, and fingers and is usually not painful. Patients may not realize\nthe injury has occurred.\nimmersion foot: Occurs after prolonged exposure to cold water. Signs include\npale, cool skin, wrinkled skin (sometimes remaining soft), and loss of feeling in\nthe injured area.\nfrostbite: The most serious local cold injury as tissues are frozen. Freezing\ncauses permanent cell damage, and gangrene may require surgical removal\nof dead tissue. Affected parts become inflamed and tender to touch.\nFrostbitten parts are often hard and waxy. Blisters and swelling may be\npresent. In superficial frostbite, only the skin is frozen; in deep frostbite,\ndeeper tissues are frozen.\n3. Assessment and Management of Cold-Related Emergencies\nAssessing cold injuries involves noting environmental conditions like wind chill and\nwetness . Ensure scene safety, identify hazards, and use standard precautions . In\nthe primary assessment, form a general impression and perform a rapid scan for life\nthreats . Quickly assess core temperature if the chief complaint is coldness . Evaluate\nmental status using AVPU .\nStages of\nHypothermia\nCore\nTemperature\n(Fahrenheit)\nSigns and Symptoms\nMild > 93.2 but < 98 Alert, shivering, rapid pulse/respirations,\nskin red/pale/cyanotic\nModerate 86 to 93.2 Shivering stops, decreased muscle activity,\ndeteriorating mental status\nSevere < 86 Lethargic, stops fighting cold, stiff/rigid\nappearance\nCore Temp < 80 < 80 Pulse slows/weakens, respirations\nslow/absent, cardiac dysrhythmias\npossible, pupillary action slow, may appear\ndead\nIf cardiac arrest is suspected, begin chest compressions . Ensure an adequate airway\nand breathing; assist with BVM if breathing is slow or shallow . Warm, humidified\noxygen helps rewarm the patient internally . Palpate for the carotid pulse for up to 60\nseconds . CPR is recommended for patients with no detectable pulse or breathing .\nPerfusion may be compromised, and bleeding may be hard to find . All hypothermic\npatients require immediate transport due to complications like cardiac dysrhythmias\nand blood clotting issues . Handle patients gently to avoid causing a cold heart to\nfibrillate . If transport is delayed, protect the patient from further heat loss .\nHistory taking includes investigating the chief complaint and obtaining medical\nhistory . Note the duration of exposure, medications, and underlying medical\nproblems . Secondary assessment involves focusing on hypothermia severity and\naffected areas . Pay attention to skin temperature, texture, and turgor . Vital signs\nindicate severity . Slow, shallow respirations can cause low oxygen . Low blood\npressure and slow pulse may indicate moderate to severe hypothermia . Evaluate\nmental status using AVPU . Use a hypothermia thermometer based on local protocol .\nReassessment involves repeating the primary assessment, checking vitals and chief\ncomplaint, and monitoring consciousness and vital signs . Rewarming can cause\ncardiac dysrhythmias .\nManagement of cold emergencies starts with moving the patient from the cold\nenvironment . Remove wet clothing and cover the patient with dry blankets . Provide\nwarm, humidified oxygen if available . Handle gently; do not massage extremities . Do\nnot allow the patient to eat or use stimulants .\nMild hypothermia: Passive rewarming is appropriate. Place the patient in a\nwarm environment and remove wet clothing. Apply heat packs/hot water\nbottles to groin, axillary, and cervical regions. Increase ambulance\ncompartment heat. Give warm fluids by mouth if the patient can swallow.\nModerate/Severe hypothermia: Do not actively rewarm. Rewarming can\ncause fatal cardiac dysrhythmias. The goal is to prevent further heat loss.\nRemove the patient immediately from the cold and remove wet clothing.\nCover with blankets and transport. Handle very gently to decrease ventricular\nfibrillation risk. If unable to move immediately, shelter the patient from wind\nand contact with cold objects. Cover with blankets and a waterproof cover,\nincluding the head and neck.\nEmergency care for local cold injuries includes removing the patient from the cold .\nHandle the injured part gently and protect it . Remove wet or restrictive clothing .\nConsider active rewarming if there is no risk of re-injury or if transport is significantly\ndelayed, and if local protocols allow . Consult medical control .\nfrostnip: Contact with a warm object may be sufficient.\nimmersion foot: Remove wet footwear, gradually rewarm the foot, and\nprotect it from further cold. Cover loosely with a dry sterile dressing. Never\nrub or massage injured tissues as this can cause more damage. Do not reexpose\nthe injury to cold.\nfrostbite: Remove clothing from the injured part. Cover loosely with a dry\nsterile dressing. Do not break blisters or rub the area. Do not apply heat or\nrewarm the part. Do not allow the patient to stand or walk on a frostbitten\nfoot. If hospital care is delayed and medical control advises field rewarming,\nuse a warm water bath immersion at 102-104 degrees. Dress the area with a\nsterile dry dressing, including between injured fingers/toes. Expect severe\npain. Never attempt rewarming if there is any chance the part might freeze\nagain.\n4. Heat-Related Emergencies: Physiology and Types\nIn hot environments or during vigorous activity, the body tries to eliminate heat\nthrough sweating and dilation of blood vessels . Removing clothing and moving to a\ncooler environment also helps . hyperthermia is a core temperature at or above 101\ndegrees Fahrenheit .\nRisk Factors for Heat Illness\nHigh air temperature reduces radiation\nHigh humidity reduces evaporation\nLack of acclimation to heat\nVigorous exercise causes fluid and electrolyte loss\nChildren, especially newborns and infants\nGeriatric patients\nPatients with heart disease, COPD, diabetes, dehydration, obesity, or limited\nmobility\nAlcohol and certain drugs cause dehydration and decrease sweating\nThere are three forms of heat emergencies: heat cramps, heat exhaustion, and\nheat stroke . All three can be present in the same patient . High-risk individuals are\nsimilar to those at risk for cold illnesses .\nHeat Cramps: Painful muscle spasms occurring after vigorous exercise. They\ndon't only occur when it's hot. The exact cause is unclear. They occasionally\noccur in leg or abdominal muscles.\nheat exhaustion (Heat Collapse): Caused by hypovolemia from losing water\nand electrolytes through heavy sweating. High humidity and exertion in poorly\nventilated areas contribute. Signs and symptoms include dizziness,\nweakness, fainting, nausea, vomiting, headache, cold clammy skin with ashen\npallor, dry tongue, and thirst. Vital signs are usually normal, pulse may be\nrapid and weak, and body temperature is normal or slightly elevated (up to\n104°F).\nheat stroke: The least common but most serious heat emergency. It happens\nwhen the body is subjected to more heat than it can handle, and normal\ncooling mechanisms are overwhelmed. Untreated heat stroke is always fatal.\nTypical situations include vigorous activity outdoors, poorly ventilated hot\nindoor spaces, heat waves without air conditioning, and children left in hot\nlocked cars. Signs and symptoms include hot, dry, or flushed skin (sweating\nmay still occur). There is a rapid rise in body temperature (up to 106°F).\nChanges in behavior, unresponsiveness, seizures, rapid weak pulse, increased\nrespiratory rate, and cessation of perspiration can occur.\n5. Assessment and Management of Heat-Related Emergencies\nScene size-up for heat emergencies involves an environmental assessment . A heat\nemergency might be secondary to a medical or trauma emergency . Consider calling\nadvanced life support for unconscious patients, altered mental status, or those\nneeding IV fluids . Look for mechanism of injury indicators, protect yourself from\nheat/biological hazards, stay hydrated, and use standard precautions .\nSigns and Symptoms\nof Heat Emergencies\nHeat\nCramps\nHeat Exhaustion Heat Stroke\nMuscle Spasms Yes No No\nDizziness, Weakness,\nSyncope\nNo Yes No (often\nunresponsive)\nNausea, Vomiting,\nHeadache\nNo Yes Yes\nSkin Appearance Normal Cold, clammy,\nashen pallor\nHot, dry/flushed\n(may still sweat)\nBody Temperature Normal Normal or slightly\nelevated (up to\n104°F)\nRapid rise (up to\n106°F)\nMental Status Alert May be altered Altered,\nunresponsive,\nseizures\nPulse Normal Rapid, weak Rapid, weak\n(becomes weaker)\nRespirations Normal Normal Increased\nPerspiration Yes Yes (heavy) May stop\nPrimary assessment starts with a general impression and observing patient\ninteraction . Assess mental status using AVPU . Ensure a patent airway in responsive\npatients; position unresponsive patients to protect the airway . Insert an oral airway\nand provide BVM ventilations for unresponsive patients . Assess perfusion and\nbleeding . Assess skin condition and treat for shock by removing from heat and\npositioning . If bleeding, manage according to protocol . Transport rapidly for heat\nstroke signs .\nHistory taking includes investigating the chief complaint, obtaining medical history,\nand noting factors predisposing to dehydration or heat problems . Determine\nheat/humidity exposure and activities before symptom onset . Secondary\nassessment involves a full body exam for unresponsive patients or a focused exam\nfor conscious patients . Assess for muscle cramps, confusion, mental status, and vital\nsigns . Pay attention to skin temperature, turgor, and moisture . Perform a careful\nneurologic exam . Vital signs may be altered; hyperthermic patients may be\ntachycardic and tachypneic . Falling blood pressure indicates shock . Skin\ntemperature can be normal/cold/clammy in heat exhaustion and hot in heat stroke .\nCheck temperature with a thermometer and pulse oximetry .\nReassessment involves repeating the primary assessment and watching for\ndeterioration . Transport heat stroke patients immediately in a cool ambulance .\nPassively cool by removing clothing and actively cool by spraying water and fanning .\nMonitor vital signs every five minutes and evaluate interventions . Avoid overcooling .\nNotify the receiving facility early about a heat stroke patient . Document\nenvironmental conditions and prior activities .\nManagement of heat emergencies:\nHeat Cramps: Remove the patient from the hot environment and loosen\nclothing. Administer high-flow oxygen. Have the patient sit or lie down until\ncramps subside. Replace fluids by mouth. Cool the patient with water\nspray/mist and fan. Activity can resume when cramps are gone. Hydration by\ndrinking water is the best prevention and treatment. Transport if cramps\npersist.\nheat exhaustion: Treat according to specific steps (skill drill 33-1).\nheat stroke: Recovery depends on treatment speed. The objective is to lower\nbody temperature by any means. Move the patient out of the hot environment\nand into the ambulance. Set AC to maximum cooling and remove clothing.\nAdminister high-flow O2 and assist ventilations if needed. Provide cold water\nimmersion if possible. Spray with cool water and fan aggressively to\nevaporate moisture. Exclude other causes of altered mental status and check\nblood glucose if possible. Transport immediately and notify the hospital. Do\nnot overcool. Call for advanced life support if the patient shivers.\n6. Water-Related Emergencies: Drowning and Diving\nDrowning is respiratory impairment from submersion or immersion in liquid . Risk\nfactors include alcohol, seizure disorders, geriatric patients with cardiovascular\ndisease, and unsupervised access to water for children . Drowning often follows\npanic in the water, leading to fatigue and sinking . It can happen in shallow water . A\nlaryngospasm (spasm of larynx and vocal cords) may occur, meant to prevent water\nfrom entering the lungs . Severe cases lead to progressive hypoxia and\nunconsciousness .\nSpinal injuries in submersion incidents should be suspected if the submersion\nresulted from a diving mishap or fall, the patient is unconscious with no information to\nrule out neck injury, or the conscious patient complains of weakness, paralysis, or\nnumbness in arms/legs . Most spinal injuries in diving incidents affect the cervical\nspine . Stabilize suspected injuries while the patient is still in the water .\nDiving emergencies can be serious, occurring with or without gear . They are\ncategorized into descent, bottom, and ascent emergencies .\nDescent Emergencies: Caused by increased pressure as a person dives\ndeeper. Commonly affected areas are lungs, sinus cavities, middle ear, teeth,\nand area under the mask. Pain (\"squeeze problems\") usually forces divers to\nreturn to the surface to equalize pressure. Pain persisting after returning to\nthe surface, especially in the ear, requires transport as a ruptured eardrum\nmay have occurred. Cold water entering the middle ear through a ruptured\neardrum can cause loss of balance and orientation. The diver may shoot to\nthe surface, leading to ascent problems.\nBottom Emergencies: Rarely occur and are usually due to faulty gear\nconnections or accidental carbon monoxide in the air supply. They can cause\ndrowning or necessitate rapid ascent.\nAscent Emergencies: The most serious and often require aggressive\nresuscitation.\nAir Embolism: The most dangerous and common scuba diving\nemergency. Air bubbles enter blood vessels. It happens when a diver\nholds their breath during rapid ascent. Air pressure in the lungs stays high\nwhile external pressure decreases, causing alveoli to rupture, potentially\nleading to pneumothorax or air embolism. Signs and symptoms include\nblotching of the skin, froth at the nose/mouth, severe pain in\nmuscles/joints/abdomen, dyspnea/chest pain, dizziness, nausea, vomiting,\ndifficulty speaking, cough, cyanosis, vision problems, paralysis/coma,\nirregular pulse, and cardiac arrest.\nDecompression Sickness (The Bends): Gas bubbles (especially nitrogen)\nobstruct blood vessels. It results from rapid ascent, diving too long/deep,\nor repeated dives. Nitrogen breathed dissolves in blood and tissues.\nComplications include blockage of tiny blood vessels, depriving parts of\nthe body of blood supply, and severe pain in tissues/spaces. Signs include\nabnormal joint pain causing the patient to \"double up\". Distinguishing\nbetween air embolism and decompression sickness can be difficult. Air\nembolism usually occurs immediately upon reaching the surface, while\ndecompression sickness signs may appear hours later. Emergency\ntreatment for both involves basic life support and recompression in a\nhyperbaric chamber.\n7. Assessment and Management of Water-Related Emergencies\nAssessment of diving and drowning emergencies begins with scene size-up and\nsafety . Use standard precautions like gloves and eye protection . Never attempt a\nwater rescue without proper training and equipment . Call for additional resources\nearly . Consider trauma and spinal immobilization .\nAssessment Steps for Water Emergencies\nScene Size-Up: Scene safety, standard precautions, call for additional resources,\nconsider trauma/spinal immobilization, look for mechanism of injury indicators\nPrimary Assessment: Form general impression, assess chest pain, dyspnea,\nsensory changes (diving emergency), determine level of consciousness (AVPU),\nbe suspicious of drug/alcohol use\nAirway and Breathing: Open airway, assess breathing, consider spinal trauma,\nsuction vomit, provide BVM ventilations if inadequate, high-flow oxygen for\nresponsive patients, auscultate breath sounds\nCirculation: Difficult to find pulse, begin CPR/AED, evaluate for shock/perfusion,\nassess for bleeding if trauma suspected\nTransport Decision: Always transport to hospital, inhalation of any fluid can cause\ndelayed complications, decompression sickness/air emboli need recompression\nchamber\nHistory Taking: Investigate chief complaint, medical history, injury-specific\nsigns/symptoms, pertinent negatives, depth/duration/time of dive, previous diving\nactivity\nSecondary Assessment: Examine lungs/breath sounds (responsive), look for\nhidden life threats/trauma (unresponsive), check for decompression sickness/air\nemboli, signs of hypothermia, peripheral pulses, skin\ncolor/discoloration/itching/pain/paresthesia\nVital Signs: Check pulse rate/rhythm/quality (peripheral and central), listen for\nheartbeat, check respiratory rate/quality/rhythm, listen for lung sounds, assess\npupil size/reactivity, oxygen saturation (may be false low)\nReassessment: Repeat primary, monitor for deterioration, assess mental\nstatus/vitals every 5 minutes, document circumstances (submersion time, water\ntemp/clarity, spinal injury possibility), bring dive equipment to hospital\nEmergency care for drowning or diving emergencies starts with rescue and removal\nfrom water . Immobilize and protect the spine if a fall or diving injury is suspected .\nArtificial ventilation should begin as soon as possible, even before leaving the water .\nRemove vomit from the airway . Assist ventilations with BVM or pocket mask .\nProvide chest compressions and use the AED if in cardiac arrest . Administer oxygen\nif the patient is breathing spontaneously . Treat for hypothermia .\nFor conscious patients suspected of air embolism or decompression sickness:\nRemove from water and keep calm . Administer oxygen and consider pneumothorax .\nMonitor breath sounds . Provide prompt transport to the emergency department or\nnearest recompression facility . Treat hypothermia from cold water immersion the\nsame way as hypothermia from cold exposure . Breath-holding syncope in shallow\nwater can lead to loss of consciousness due to decreased stimulus for breathing and\nresults in drowning . Treatment is the same as for a drowning patient .\nPrevention is key . Pools should be fenced, and lack of adult supervision is a\ncommon cause of child drownings . Alcohol is associated with half of teenage and\nadult drownings .\n8. High Altitude Sickness\nDysbarism injuries are caused by differences between atmospheric pressure and\ngas pressure in body tissues, fluids, and cavities . Altitude sickness occurs when\nunacclimated people are exposed to diminished oxygen pressure at high altitudes .\nIllnesses affect the central nervous and pulmonary systems . They range from acute\nmountain sickness to high altitude cerebral edema (HACE) and high altitude\npulmonary edema (HAPE) .\nAcute Mountain Sickness: Can occur above 5,000 feet due to diminished\noxygen pressure and hypoxia. It results from ascending too high, too fast, or\nnot being acclimated. Signs and symptoms include headache, lightheadedness,\nfatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, difficulty sleeping, shortness of\nbreath during exertion, and possibly a swollen face. Treatment is stopping the\nascent and descending.\nHigh Altitude Pulmonary Edema (HAPE): Can happen above 8,000 feet.\nFluid collects in the lungs, hindering oxygen passage into the bloodstream.\nSigns and symptoms include shortness of breath, a cough with pink sputum,\ncyanosis, and rapid pulse.\nHigh Altitude Cerebral Edema (HACE): Can happen above 12,000 feet and\nmay accompany HAPE. It can quickly become life-threatening. Signs and\nsymptoms include a severe, constant, throbbing headache, lack of muscle\ncoordination and balance, extreme fatigue, vomiting, and loss of\nconsciousness.\nTreatment for HAPE and HACE involves descending to a lower altitude, providing\noxygen, and rapid transport . Provide positive pressure ventilation with a BVM for\ninadequate respirations . CPAP may help patients with respiratory distress from HAPE\n.\n9. Lightning Strikes\nAn estimated 25 million cloud-to-ground lightning strikes occur annually in the US .\nLightning is the fifth most common cause of death from isolated environmental\nphenomena . Direct strikes target those in outdoor activities or large open areas .\nMany are indirectly struck near a struck object . The cardiovascular and nervous\nsystems are most commonly injured . Respiratory and cardiac arrest are the most\ncommon causes of lightning-related deaths . Tissue damage usually occurs over the\nskin as the strike duration is short . Skin burns are typically superficial .\nCategories of\nLightning Strikes\nCharacteristics\nMild Loss of consciousness, amnesia, confusion, tingling,\nnon-specific signs, superficial burns\nModerate Seizures, respiratory arrest, dysrhythmias (resolve\nspontaneously), superficial burns\nSevere Cardiopulmonary arrest\nEmergency care and treatment: Protect yourself from being struck . Move the patient\nto a sheltered area . Use reverse triage: prioritize anyone in cardiac or respiratory\narrest first . Stabilize the spine and open the airway with a jaw thrust . If pulses are\npresent, assist ventilation . If in cardiac arrest, use the AED as soon as possible .\nControl bleeding and transport . Patients with signs/symptoms but no obvious life\nthreats should be transported for evaluation .\n10. Bites and Envenomations: Spiders and Insects\nIn the US, only the female black widow and the brown recluse spider deliver\nserious, life-threatening bites .\nCharacteristics of\nVenomous Spiders\nin the US\nBlack Widow Brown Recluse\nSize ~2 inches (legs\nextended)\n~1 inch long\nColor Usually black Dull brown\nMarkings Bright red/orange\nhourglass on belly\nViolin-shaped mark (brown to\nyellow) on back\nHabitat Dry, dim places around\nbuildings, wood piles,\ndebris\nDark areas like corners of old\nbuildings, under rocks, wood\npiles\nBite Pain Sometimes overlooked\n(site may become numb),\nbut usually causes\nlocalized pain\nNot painful at first, becomes so\nwithin hours\nVenom Type Neurotoxic (nerve tissue\ndamage)\nCytotoxic (severe local tissue\ndamage)\nLocal Effects Localized pain, agonizing\nmuscle spasms\n(especially in abdomen)\nSwelling, tenderness,\npale/mottled/cyanotic center,\npossibly small blisters. Scab\nforms, creating a large ulcer.\nSystemic\nSymptoms\nDizziness, sweating,\nnausea, vomiting, rashes,\nchest tightness, difficulty\nbreathing, severe\ncramps. Usually subside\nin 48 hours.\nRarely cause systemic\nsymptoms.\nAntivenom Available, reserved for\nsevere bites due to side\neffects\nNot mentioned as a common\ntreatment\nHigh-Risk Groups Older people, children <\n5\nNot specified as distinctly\ndifferent from general\npopulation\nEmergency Care BLS for respiratory\ndistress, rapid transport,\nbring spider if possible\nBLS, rapid transport, bring\nspider if possible\nStings from bees, wasps, yellow jackets, and ants are usually painful but not a\nmedical emergency . Remove the stinger and venom sac by scraping with a firm\nedge . Use ice packs for pain control . Anaphylaxis can occur if the patient is allergic .\nSigns of anaphylaxis include flushed skin, low blood pressure, difficulty breathing,\nwheezes, hives, or swelling of the throat/tongue . Be prepared to assist with an\nEpiPen auto-injector and support airway/breathing .\n11. Bites and Envenomations: Snakes and Scorpions\nSnake bite fatalities in the US are rare, about 15 per year . Only 19 of approximately\n115 native US species are venomous . Venomous species include rattlesnakes,\ncopperheads, cottonmouths (pit vipers), and coral snakes . Snakes usually bite when\nprovoked or accidentally injured, except for the aggressive cottonmouths . Protect\nyourself with caution and proper gear . One-third of bites from venomous snakes\ndon't result in significant injury . Venomous snakes have hollow fangs that inject\npoison . Poisonous snake bites typically leave two small puncture wounds with\ndiscoloration, swelling, and pain . Non-venomous snakes leave a horseshoe of tooth\nmarks . Fang marks indicate a poisonous bite .\nPit Vipers: Include rattlesnakes, copperheads, and cottonmouths. They have\ntriangular, flat heads and heat-sensing pits near their nostrils. Fangs are\nhollow teeth connected to venom sacs.\nRattlesnakes: Most common pit viper, often with diamond patterns, can\ngrow large.\nCopperheads: Two to three feet long, red copper color with brown/red\nbands. Inhabit wood piles and abandoned dwellings. Account for most\nvenomous bites in the eastern US. Bites are rarely fatal but venom causes\nsignificant tissue damage in extremities.\nCottonmouths (Water Moccasins): About four feet long, olive brown with\nblack bands. Aggressive water snakes. Fatalities are rare, but tissue\ndestruction can be severe.\nSigns of Pit Viper Envenomation: Severe burning at the site followed by\nswelling and blue discoloration (ecchymosis) within 5-10 minutes,\nspreading over 36 hours. Venom interferes with clotting, causing bleeding\nat distant sites. Other symptoms may include weakness, nausea, vomiting,\nsweating, fevers, fainting, vision problems, altered consciousness, and\nshock if swelling occurs. Mark the edges of swelling with a pen.\nTreatment for Pit Viper Bites: Calm the patient and place in a supine\nposition. Clean the bite area. Apply ice. Consider pressure immobilization\nbandage on an arm/leg. Keep the affected extremity below the heart. Be\nalert for anaphylaxis and treat with Epi auto-injector if appropriate. Do not\ngive anything by mouth. Be alert for vomiting. If bitten on the trunk, keep\nsupine and quiet, transport quickly. Monitor vital signs and mark swelling\nprogression. Treat for shock if signs appear. Bring the killed snake or a\nphoto. Notify the hospital and describe the snake. Transport appropriately.\nIf no envenomation signs, perform BLS, apply a sterile dressing, and\nimmobilize the site. All suspected snake bite patients should go to the ED.\nTreat the wound like a deep puncture to prevent infection.\nCoral Snakes: Small reptiles with bright red, yellow, and black bands around\nthe body. \"Red on yellow will kill a fellow, red on black, venom will lack\" helps\nidentify venomous coral snakes. They inject venom by chewing, leaving\npuncture or scratch wounds. Due to small mouth/teeth, they usually bite small\nareas like fingers/toes. Venom is a powerful neurotoxin causing nervous\nsystem paralysis. Within hours, bizarre behavior and progressive paralysis of\neye movements and respiration can occur. Successful treatment relies on\nsnake identification and respiratory support. Antivenom is available but not\nwidely stocked. Emergency care is the same as for a pit viper bite.\nScorpions are arachnids with a venom gland and stinger . They are rare in the US,\nmostly in the Southwest deserts . With one exception, stings are painful but not\ndangerous, causing localized swelling/discoloration . A specific type of scorpion's\nvenom can cause severe systemic reactions: circulatory collapse, severe muscle\ncontractions, excessive salivation, hypertension, convulsions, and cardiac failure .\nNotify medical control, administer BLS, and transport rapidly if this type of sting is\nsuspected .\n12. Bites and Envenomations: Ticks and Marine Animals\nTicks are tiny insects that attach to the skin . Found in brush, shrubs, trees, sand\ndunes, and on animals . Bites are not painful, but infectious diseases can spread\nthrough tick saliva .\nDiseases\nTransmitted by\nTicks\nCharacteristics\nRocky Mountain\nspotted fever\nOccurs 7-10 days after bite. Symptoms: nausea, vomiting,\nheadache, weakness, paralysis, cardiorespiratory collapse.\nLyme disease Reported across the US except Hawaii. First symptoms: fever,\nflu-like symptoms, bull's-eye rash spreading over days/weeks.\nPainful joint swelling (especially knees) can occur and may\ncause permanent disability if untreated. Responds to prompt\nantibiotic treatment. Most common in summer.\nProvide supportive care and transport . If access to care is delayed, remove the tick\nby grasping the head with fine tweezers and pulling straight out . Clean the area with\nantiseptic and save the tick for identification . Do not handle the tick with fingers .\nPatients should follow up with a healthcare provider .\nMarine animal envenomations are common . Stinging cells (nematocysts) are found\nin fire coral, Portuguese man-of-war, sea wasps, sea nettles, true jellyfish, sea\nanemones, and coral . Signs and symptoms include painful red lesions, lesions\nextending in a line, headache, dizziness, muscle cramps, and fainting . Treatment:\nRemove from water . Scrape off tentacles with a stiff object like a credit card . Do not\nmanipulate remaining tentacles . Treat for anaphylactic shock if a systemic allergic\nreaction occurs . Give BLS and transport immediately .\nToxins from spines of sea urchins, stingrays, and spiny fish (lionfish, scorpion fish,\nstone fish) are heat sensitive . Treatment: Immobilize the affected area and soak in\nhot water for 30 minutes . Transport the patient . Be familiar with local marine life if\nworking near the ocean .\nGeneral emergency treatment for marine envenomations: Limit further discharge by\navoiding fresh water, wet sand, showers, or careless handling . Keep the patient calm\nand reduce motion of the affected extremity . Remove remaining tentacles by\nscraping . Immersion in vinegar may help alleviate symptoms . Provide transport to\nthe emergency department .\n13. Conclusion and Review\nThis chapter covered environmental emergencies, including cold exposure,\nhypothermia, frostbite, heat emergencies, drowning, diving emergencies, and\nlightning strikes . Review questions help reinforce understanding of heat loss\nmechanisms, indicators of hypothermia, rewarming techniques, treatment for local\ncold injuries, management of heat emergencies, and recognizing diving-related\nconditions . The concept of reverse triage in lightning strikes is also reviewed,\nprioritizing those in cardiac arrest . Understanding these environmental emergencies\nand their appropriate management is crucial .",
