Review of Key Concepts A\n1. Prioritizing EMT Well-being\nAspect of Wellbeing\nDescription Source\nRecognizing\nHazards\nEMTs must identify potential threats to their\nhealth, safety, and well-being.\n[3]\nCoping with\nStress\nManaging both physical and mental stress is\ncrucial.\n[2]\nAssisting\nEmotional Aspects\nHelping patients and families with the\nemotional impact of illness, injury, or death is\npart of the role.\n[2]\nEnsuring Personal\nSafety\nTaking preventative actions is important.\n[2]\nDealing with\nSensitivity\nInteracting with patients and co-workers\nrequires sensitivity.\n[2]\nProper\nPrecautions\nUsing appropriate measures for infectious\ndiseases is essential.\n[2]\nPreventing Injuries Avoiding on-the-job injuries is a priority.\n[2]\nTo effectively care for others, emergency medical technicians (EMTs) must prioritize\ntheir own well-being [2]. Recognizing hazards to health, safety, and well-being is very\nimportant [3]. These hazards include personal neglect, environmental threats, humanmade\nthreats, and mental and physical stress [4]. The emotional well-being of an\nemployee and the patient are intertwined, especially in high-stress rescues [5].\nwellness is the active pursuit of a good state of health [10]. resilience is the capacity\nto cope with and recover from distress [11].\n2. Strategies for Enhancing Resilience and Managing Stress\nPractices that can help increase resilience include eating healthy and maintaining a\nwell-balanced diet [12]. Ensuring a minimum of seven to nine hours of sleep is also\nimportant [12]. Strengthening positive relationships with family and friends can build\nresilience [12]. Building relationships with peers and colleagues is also recommended\n[12]. Incorporating daily stretching, movement, and exercise helps [12]. Building habits\nof mindfulness and positivity contributes to resilience [12].\nStrategies can be used to manage stress [13]. Minimizing or eliminating stressors as\nmuch as possible is helpful [14]. Changing partners to avoid negative personalities or\nchanging work hours can reduce stress [15]. Cutting back on overtime might also be\nan option [15]. Changing your attitude about the stressor can make a difference [16].\nTalking about feelings with people you trust is important [16]. Seeking professional\ncounseling is an option if needed [17]. Do not obsess over frustrating situations that\nare unable to change [18]. Focus on delivering high-quality care [18]. Adopting a\nphilosophical outlook can be beneficial [19]. Expanding your social support system\nbeyond co-workers helps manage stress [20]. Developing friends and interests\noutside of emergency services is recommended [20]. Limiting the intake of caffeine,\nalcohol, and tobacco use is also advised [20].\n3. Nutrition, Exercise, and Sleep for EMTs\nHealth\nAspect\nRecommendations Consequences of\nNeglect\nSource\nNutrition\nand Fluids\nEat regular, well-balanced\nmeals; Limit sugar, fat, sodium,\nand alcohol; Consume complex\ncarbohydrates for long-term\nenergy; Maintain adequate fluid\nintake, preferably water.\nObesity, cardiac\ndisease, other\nlong-term health\nproblems from\nexcessive fat\nintake.\n[21]\nExercise\nand\nRelaxation\nRegular exercise enhances\nnutrition and hydration benefits;\nHandle stress more easily when\nin good physical condition;\nEngage in at least 30 minutes of\nmoderate or vigorous activity\n5+ days/week; Include\ncardiovascular endurance,\nmuscle strength, and flexibility.\nHandling stress\nbecomes more\ndifficult.\n[25]\nSleep Adults need 7-9 hours of sleep;\nWork shifts shorter than 24\nhours; Access to caffeine and\nopportunity to nap on duty;\nEducation and training on\nfatigue mitigation; 20-30\nminute naps or rest breaks\nduring shifts; Increase physical\nactivity; Be careful about\ncaffeine; Engage in mental\nexercise; Avoid caffeine,\nnicotine, chemicals 4+ hours\nbefore bed; Ensure dark, quiet,\ncool sleep environment;\nMedical errors,\nvehicle crashes,\nharm to patients,\nbystanders, other\nEMS providers\n(short-term);\nHypertension,\nsleep apnea,\nrespiratory issues,\ndiabetes,\ndepression, other\nmedical conditions\n(long-term);\nIncreased stress.\n[28]\nExercise early but allow time to\nrelax; Nap early and avoid\nheavy pre-sleep meals; Balance\nfluid intake; Establish calming\npre-sleep routine; Sleep when\ntruly tired; Keep sleep schedule\nconsistent; Expose to natural\nlight during waking hours.\nEating regular, well-balanced meals is important [21]. Limit consumption of sugar, fat,\nsodium, and alcohol [21]. complex carbohydrates like pasta and rice are reliable for\nlong-term energy [22]. Fats can lead to obesity and cardiac disease if eaten too much\n[23]. Maintaining adequate fluid intake is crucial [24]. Water is generally the best fuel\navailable [24].\nRegular exercise enhances good nutrition and hydration [25]. Being in good physical\ncondition makes handling stress easier [26]. Engage in at least 30 minutes of\nmoderate or vigorous activity at least five days per week [27]. Include cardiovascular\nendurance, muscle strength building, and muscle flexibility [27].\nAdults should sleep a minimum of seven to nine hours [28]. Half of EMS personnel get\nless than six hours of sleep [29]. They report severe mental and physical fatigue [29].\nShort-term effects of sleep deprivation include medical errors and vehicle crashes\n[30]. Long-term effects include hypertension, sleep apnea, and diabetes [31].\nIncreased stress contributes to sleep deprivation and fatigue [31]. Guidelines for\nfatigue management have been developed [32]. EMS personnel should work shifts\nshorter than 24 hours [35]. They should have access to caffeine and opportunity to\nnap [36]. Education and training can help mitigate fatigue [38]. Recommendations to\ncombat fatigue include adequate sleep and taking 20 to 30 minute naps [39]. Increase\nphysical activity and be careful about caffeine consumption [39]. Engage in mental\nexercise [39]. To improve sleep quality, avoid caffeine, nicotine, and other chemicals\nbefore bed [40]. Ensure your sleep environment is dark, quiet, and cool [41]. Exercise\nearly but relax before trying to sleep [41]. Nap early and avoid heavy pre-sleep meals\n[41]. Balance fluid intake and establish a calming pre-sleep routine [41]. Sleep when\ntruly tired and keep your schedule consistent [41]. Expose yourself to natural light\nduring waking hours [41].\n4. Disease Prevention and Health Promotion\nDisease prevention focuses on medical care and prevention to avoid or reduce\ndisease effects [42]. health promotion focuses on personal practices and social habits\nto improve health [43]. Smoking, vaping, or chewing nicotine can lead to\ncardiovascular and respiratory disease [44]. Smokeless tobacco is associated with\ncancers of the throat, mouth, and pancreas [45]. Vaping has been shown to cause\ncardiovascular and respiratory illness [46]. Strategies for quitting nicotine include\ncreating a plan and setting a quit date [47]. Tell a friend, family, or co-worker your plan\n[47]. Remove tobacco and vaping products from your surroundings [47]. Talk to your\ndoctor about resources that can help you quit [47].\nAn acceptable amount of alcohol is one drink per day for women and two for men [48]\n. Excessive alcohol use causes about 88,000 deaths per year in the United States [49]\n. It also costs more than $200 billion per year [49]. Approximately 75 percent of the\ncost is due to binge drinking [50]. Excessive alcohol use can adversely affect\ncardiovascular, hepatic, immune, and central nervous systems [50]. It may increase\nthe risk of developing certain cancers [50].\nBoth prescription and illegal drugs may be abused or misused [51]. According to the\nCDC, drug abuse costs the United States more than 190 billion dollars annually [52].\nMany EMS agencies drug test their employees [53]. Balancing work, family, and health\nis important [53]. When possible, rotate your schedule to give yourself time off [53].\nYou need to take vaccinations [54]. If the stress of work is too much, seek help [54].\n5. Infectious and Communicable Diseases: Risks and Prevention\nTerm Definition Source\nPathogen A microorganism capable of causing\ndisease.\n[60]\nContamination Presence of an infectious organism or\nforeign body on or within objects, wounds,\nor a patient's body.\n[61]\nExposure Contact with blood, body fluids, tissues, or\nairborne particles that may allow disease\ntransmission.\n[61]\nPersonal Protective\nEquipment (PPE)\nProtective equipment worn by an individual\nto prevent exposure to a pathogen or\nhazardous material.\n[62]\nAn infectious disease is caused by organisms within the body [55]. A communicable\ndisease can be spread from person to person or from one species to another [56].\nInfection is a risk for EMTs [57]. Infection risk can be minimized by immunizations,\nprotective techniques, and hand washing [58].\nRoutes of transmission include direct contact and indirect contact like a needle stick\n[63]. Airborne transmission occurs through sneezing [63]. Foodborne transmission is\nfrom contaminated food [63]. vector-borne transmission is via a flea or mosquito [63].\nOSHA develops, publishes, and enforces guidelines for reducing workplace hazards\n[64]. All EMTs are trained in handling blood-borne pathogens [65]. The CDC has\ndeveloped standard precautions for healthcare workers [66]. standard precautions\nprevent contact with objects, blood, body fluids, and other potential risks [67].\nAssume every person is potentially infected [68]. Apply infection control procedures\nto reduce infection [68]. OSHA refers to this as universal precautions [69]. Notify your\ndesignated officer if you are exposed [70].\ndonning and doffing full PPE in a consistent sequence is essential [71]. Common\ncomponents of PPE include a mask, eyewear, face shield, gloves, and a gown [72].\nProper hand washing is the simplest and most effective way to control disease\ntransmission [73]. Wash hands before and after patient contact, even if you wear\ngloves [74]. Wear gloves if there is any possibility of exposure to blood or body fluids\n[75]. Vinyl, nitrile, and latex gloves are effective [76]. Wear heavy-duty gloves when\ncleaning the ambulance [77]. Change gloves between patients [77]. Removing gloves\nrequires a technique to avoid self-contamination [78].\nEye protection prevents blood splatters [79]. Prescription glasses are not adequate\n[79]. Goggles or a face shield are best [79]. Gowns provide protection for extensive\nblood splatter [80]. They may be worn during aerosolized generating procedures or\nmajor trauma [80]. Wear a standard surgical mask for fluid splatter [81]. Place a surgical\nmask on a patient [81]. Wear a particulate air respirator like an N95 if an airborne\ndisease is suspected [81]. Protective eyewear using safety glasses with side shields,\ngoggles, or a face shield is also needed [81]. If a patient needs oxygen, use a nonrebreathing\nmask instead of a surgical mask [82]. Particulate air respirators must\ncomply with OSHA guidelines and be fit tested [83].\nMouth-to-mouth or mouth-to-mask resuscitation is recommended during active\ncommunity spread of an airborne virus [85]. Bag-valve ventilation is an aerosolgenerating\nprocedure and should be avoided in epidemic scenarios like COVID-19 [86]\n. Proper use and disposal of sharps help avoid exposure to HIV and hepatitis [87]. Do\nnot recap, break, or bend needles [88]. Dispose of used sharps in an approved,\nclosed, and rigid container [89].\n6. Employer Responsibilities and Immunity\nThe risk of being exposed to a communicable disease is a job hazard [90]. You should\nfollow OSHA and other national guidelines to reduce exposure risk [91]. Know and\nfollow your department's infection control plan [92]. Cleaning and decontaminating\nthe ambulance and equipment is important [93]. Clean the ambulance after each use\nand daily whenever possible [94]. Cleaning should ideally be done at the hospital [95].\nRemove medical waste and place it in a red biohazard bag [97]. Dispose of it at the\nhospital [97]. Contaminated equipment left at the hospital should be cleaned by staff\nor bagged for transport [98]. Use a bleach water solution at a 1 to 10 dilution to clean\nthe unit [99]. Remove contaminated linen and place it in the appropriate bag [100].\nReusable equipment should be cleaned and sterilized per department procedure [101].\nEven if germs reach you, you are not necessarily at risk of infection [102]. Immunity is\na major factor in determining who gets sick [103]. You can be immune or resistant to\nparticular germs [104]. Immunity means having been immunized or vaccinated and\nable to recover from an infection [105]. A history of childhood infectious diseases\nshould be recorded [106]. This includes chickenpox, mumps, measles, rubella, and\nwhooping cough [107]. The CDC recommends several immunizations for healthcare\nworkers [108]. Hepatitis B is required by OSHA [108]. Yearly influenza vaccination is\nrecommended [108]. MMR and varicella vaccines are also recommended [108]. The\nTdap shot is recommended every 10 years [108]. Skin tests for tuberculosis are\nrecommended prior to hire and annually [109].\nFor general post-exposure management, turn over patient care to another provider if\nexposed to blood or body fluids [110]. Clean the exposed area with soap and water\n[110]. If eyes were exposed, rinse them for 20 minutes [110]. Activate your department's\ninfection control plan [111]. Complete an exposure report [112]. Be screened to\ndetermine significant exposure to a bloodborne pathogen [112]. You may be required\nto quarantine if exposed to a highly communicable disease without proper PPE [112].\nPost-exposure prophylactics and treatment are available for significant exposure [113].\n7. Scene Safety Protocols\nHazard Protective Measures Source\nHazardous\nMaterials\nRead labels/placards from a distance; Call a\nhazardous material team; Do not care for patients\nuntil moved and decontaminated; Remain upwind and\nuphill; Keep distance; Contact dispatch for additional\nresponse; Do not enter until instructed.\n[117]\nElectricity Mark off a danger zone around downed lines (one\nspan of power poles); Do not approach downed wires\nor anything in contact with them; Avoid high ground\nduring lightning; Stay away from drainage ditches,\nmoist areas, small depressions, and wet ropes during\nlightning; Become the smallest target possible; Drop\nall equipment.\n[126]\nFire Be aware of smoke, oxygen deficiency, high\ntemperatures, toxic gases, building collapse risk,\nequipment, or explosions.\n[135]\nVehicle\nCrashes\nUse sufficient proper protective gear; Be aware of\ntraffic, unstable vehicles, downed power lines,\nviolence risk, airbags, fluids, and sharp objects.\n[136]\nPersonal safety is very important in an emergency situation [114]. Safety begins with\nprotecting yourself as soon as you are dispatched [114]. Wear your seatbelt and don\nappropriate PPE [114]. Continue to protect yourself once on scene [115]. Make sure the\nscene is well marked [115]. Place warning devices to alert other motorists [115]. Park at\na safe distance from the scene [115]. Ensure there are plenty of lights if it is dark [116].\nWear reflective clothing in dark scenes [116].\nUpon arrival at a scene with potential hazardous materials, read labels, placards, and\nidentification numbers from a distance [117]. A specially trained hazardous material\nteam will handle disposal or patient removal [118]. Do not begin caring for patients\nuntil they are moved and decontaminated [119]. Do not enter the scene unless it is\nsafe to do so [120]. The U.S. Department of Transportation ERG lists common hazard\nmaterials and procedures [122]. Smartphone and tablet apps are also available [123].\nGeneral guidelines for hazmat scenes include not entering the scene if there is\nevidence of a hazmat [123]. Remain upwind and uphill from the scene [124]. Keep your\ndistance [124]. Quickly contact dispatch and request additional responses [124]. Do not\nenter the scene until instructed by trained responders [125].\nDealing with downed power lines is beyond EMT training [127]. Mark off a danger zone\naround the downed lines until poles are secured [128]. This safety zone is one span of\nthe power poles' distance [128]. Do not approach a downed wire or touch anything it\ncontacts [129]. Lightning is a threat from a direct hit or a ground current [130]. A repeat\nlightning strike can occur in the same area [132]. Avoid high ground to minimize direct\nlightning strike risk [132]. To avoid ground current injury, stay away from drainage\nditches, moist areas, and wet ropes [133]. Become the smallest target possible and\ndrop all equipment [134].\nCommon hazards at a fire include smoke, oxygen deficiency, and high temperatures\n[135]. Toxic gases, building collapse, equipment, or explosions are also hazards [135].\nVehicle crashes are common events [136]. Hazards at vehicle crashes include traffic,\nunstable vehicles, and downed power lines [136]. Risk of violence, airbags, and fluid\nand sharp objects are also present [137]. Use sufficient proper protective gear to\nreduce risk [137].\n8. Managing Violence on Scenes\nViolence on scenes includes assaults, hostile situations, riots, or disturbances [138]. A\nscene assessment should begin while en route [138]. Once on scene, continue\nassessment using observation and information from other responders [138]. Maintain\npersonal safety and the safety of your team [138]. Mass violence situations may\ninvolve several agencies [139]. Know who is in command [139]. Remain vigilant for\npotential violence at all times [139]. Allow law enforcement to secure the scene before\napproaching scenes involving projectiles [139]. Find protection [139].\nTwo types of protection exist [140]. cover is the use of impenetrable barriers for\nprotection [140]. concealment is hiding behind objects to limit visibility [141]. If the\nevent is a crime scene, attempt to maintain the chain of evidence [142]. Do not disturb\nthe scene unless absolutely necessary for patient treatment [143]. The rate of\nviolence-related injuries for emergency responders is 22 times higher than for other\nemployees [143]. Recommendations for preventing violence include training in\nidentifying potential violence scenes [144]. Training in de-escalation strategies and\ntechniques is recommended [144]. Practice ongoing scene assessments [144].\nDispatch identification and alerting of past or potential threats is important [144].\nRecommendations for protection against violence include training in self-defense and\nescape techniques [145]. Training in physical and chemical restraint techniques is also\nrecommended [145]. Fitting and use of body armor is advised [145]. Training and\npractice in operations with law enforcement is crucial [145].\n9. Protective Clothing and Gear\nType of\nProtective\nClothing/Gear\nPurpose Source\nCold Weather\nGear\nPulls moisture away from skin (inner layer);\nServes as insulation (middle layer); Resists\nwind, rain, sleet, snow (outer layer).\n[149]\nTurnout Gear\n(Bunker Gear)\nProtects firefighters from heat, fire, sparks, and\nflashover.\n[152]\nGloves Protect from heat, cold, and cuts; May reduce\ndexterity.\n[153]\nHelmets Protection anytime working in a fall zone;\nShould provide top and side protection; Secure\nchin strap; Not well suited for rescue situations;\nHelmet with chin strap and face shield for\nelectrical hazards.\n[154]\nBoots Water resistant, fit well, flexible; Steel-toed\npreferred; Traction important for rescue.\n[158]\nEye Protection Protects from blood splatters; Eyeglasses with\nside shields for routine care and when tools are\nused; Use face shield and goggles when\nappropriate.\n[160]\nEar Protection Soft foam industrial type ear plugs.\n[161]\nSkin Protection Protects against sunburn; Use sunscreen with\nminimum 15 SPF.\n[162]\nBody Armor\n(Bulletproof Vests)\nRanges from lightweight to heavy; May not be\npractical for everyday use; Costly; Do not\nprotect against rifle ammunition or stabbing.\n[164]\nWearing protective clothing and other appropriate gear is critical to personal safety\n[146]. Become familiar with the protective equipment available to you [147]. Inspect\nyour clothing and wear your gear regularly, ideally before reaching the scene [148].\nMany EMS services have restricted policies regarding hair, rings, and jewelry [166]. Tie\nhair up neatly [167]. Limit the number of rings worn [167]. Wear only a watch on your\nwrist [168].\n10. Caring for Critically Ill and Injured Patients\nA patient needs to know who you are and what you are doing [168]. Let the patient\nknow you are attending to their immediate needs [169]. Avoid making unprofessional\ncomments during resuscitation [169]. Treat all patients with dignity and respect [169].\nTechniques for communicating with critical patients include avoiding sad and grim\ncomments [170]. Such remarks may increase the patient's anxiety [170]. Orient the\npatient to their surroundings using brief statements [170]. Be honest, deciding how\nmuch information the patient can understand [170]. Allow the patient to be part of the\ncare being given [171]. Allow for hope if there is a slight chance [171]. Locate and notify\nfamily members [171]. Assure the patient that you will take care of notifying\nappropriate people [171].\nCritically injured children should be cared for as any adult [172]. It is important that a\nrelative or responsible adult accompany the child [173]. This helps relieve anxiety and\nassists in care [173].\n11. Coping with Death and Dying\nThe death of a child is a tragic and dreaded event [175]. Help the family through the\ninitial period of death [176]. Acknowledge death in a private place [177]. Shock, denial,\nand disbelief are common emotions [178]. If circumstances allow, let the parents hold\nthe child [179]. Use your best judgment to determine if this is appropriate [180]. Let the\nfamily's actions be your guide [181]. The family may want to see the child, and you\nshould allow them to do so [182]. Prepare the parents for what they will see [183]. Do\nnot overload the grieving parents with information [184].\nDeath is likely to be either sudden or after a prolonged terminal illness [186]. The EMT\nwill sometimes face death [187]. The grieving process has stages [188]. The first stages\ninclude denial, anger, hostility, bargaining, depression, or acceptance [189]. What can\nthe EMT do? You can ask the patient and family if there is anything you can do to\nhelp [190]. Reinforce the reality of the situation [190]. Be honest with death and dying\n[191]. Do not say you know how the patient or family feels [192]. Let the patient or\nfamily members grieve in their own way [193].\n12. Stress Management for EMTs\nPhysiological Manifestations of Stress\nIncreased respirations and Heart rate [198]\nIncreased blood vessels dilated [198]\nVessels near the skin surface dilated [198]\nPupils tense [198]\nMuscles increase blood glucose levels [198]\nPerspiration [198]\nDecreases blood flow to the gastrointestinal tract [199]\nEMS is a high-stress job [195]. It is important to know the causes of stress and ways\nto deal with them [196]. Stressors include emotional, physical, and environmental\nsituations [196]. There are general adaptation syndromes [197]. The alarm response\noccurs first [197]. Then there is reaction and resistance to stress [197]. Finally, there is\nrecovery or exhaustion [197].\nSituations stressful for EMS providers include dangerous situations [200]. Physical or\npsychological demands are also stressors [200]. Critically ill or injured patients are\nstressful [200]. Dead or dying patients can be overpowering [200]. Sight, smells, and\nsounds can cause stress [200]. Multiple patient situations are stressful [200]. Angry or\nupset patients, families, or bystanders contribute to stress [200]. The unpredictability\nand demands of EMS cause stressful situations [200].\nThere are different stress reactions [201]. An acute reaction can occur during the\nevent [201]. A delayed reaction manifests after the stressful event [202]. Cumulative\nstress is prolonged or excessive stress [202]. Physical symptoms of stress include\nfatigue and changes in appetite [202]. GI problems, headaches, and insomnia are also\nsymptoms [202]. Irritability and inability to concentrate can occur [202]. Hyperactivity\nor underactivity can be physical symptoms [202]. Physiological symptoms include fear\nand depression [203]. Guilt, oversensitivity, anger, and frustration are also symptoms\n[203].\n13. Critical Incident Stress and Burnout\nCritical incident stress is brought about by acute, severe stressors [204]. These can\ninclude mass casualty incidents [205]. Serious injury or traumatic death of a child can\ncause this stress [205]. Crashes with injuries caused by an emergency provider are\nalso critical incidents [205]. Death or serious injury of a co-worker in the line of duty is\na severe stressor [205]. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may develop after a\ndistressing event [206]. It is characterized by re-experiencing the event [206]. Overresponding\nto stimuli recalled from the event is also a characteristic [206].\nCritical Incident Stress Management (CISM) helps providers relieve stress [207]. This\ncan occur formally or at an ongoing scene [207]. Trained CISM professionals facilitate\ndiffusing sessions [208]. Diffusing sessions are held during or immediately after the\nevent [208]. Debriefing sessions are held 24 to 72 hours after the event [208]. An\nimportant rule is not to turn the debriefing into an operational critique [209]. If CISM is\nnot an option, private counseling by a mental health professional may be preferred\n[210].\nBurnout describes a combination of exhaustion, cynicism, and poor performance [211].\nIt results from long-term job stress [211]. Burnout affects the well-being of the EMT\nand their colleagues and patients [212]. It can result in increased major medical errors\n[212]. Increased rates of healthcare-associated infection can occur [212]. Increased\npatient mortality is also a possible effect [212]. It contributes to decreases in work\nmorale and overall work effort [213]. Effective teamwork and patient satisfaction can\ndecrease [213]. Burnout can lead to an increase in job turnover [213].\nCompassion fatigue is common among healthcare providers [214]. It is also known as\nsecondary stress disorder [214]. It is characterized by a gradual lessening of\ncompassion over time [214]. Symptoms include high absenteeism and difficult\nrelationships with colleagues [215]. Inability to work in teams and aggressive behavior\ntowards patients are symptoms [215]. Strong negative attitudes towards work and\nlack of empathy for patients can occur [215]. A judgmental attitude towards patients\nand preoccupation with non-work issues are also symptoms [215]. Other symptoms of\nincreased stress are present [215].\nThe suicide rate among emergency responders is higher than the rest of the\npopulation [216]. Job stress is widely considered the largest contributing factor to\nsuicide [217]. Several organizations and mental health services are available to provide\nemotional support [218].\n14. Emotional Aspects of Emergency Care and Workplace Issues\nEven experienced healthcare providers sometimes have difficulty overcoming\npersonal reactions [218]. The struggle to remain calm in horrible circumstances\ncontributes to emotional stress [219]. In stressful situations, exercise extreme\nprofessional care in both words and actions [219]. Factors influencing a patient's\nreaction to stress include socioeconomic background and fear of medical personnel\n[219]. Alcohol or substance abuse disorders and a history of chronic stress also play a\nrole [219]. Mental disorders, reaction to medication, age, and nutritional status are\nfactors [219]. Feelings of guilt and past experiences with illness or injury also influence\nreactions [219]. Quickly and calmly assess the actions of the patient, family, and\nbystanders [220]. Use a professional tone, courtesy, sincere concern, and efficient\naction [221]. Patients must have the opportunity to express their fears and concerns\n[222]. Religious customs or needs of the patient must be respected [223]. Some people\nhave religious convictions opposing medication, blood, and blood products [223].\nReport this information to the next level of care [224]. In the event of death, handle the\nbody with respect and dignity [225].\nWorkplace issues include cultural diversity on the job [226]. You are expected to work\nalongside co-workers with varying backgrounds, attitudes, beliefs, and values [226].\nAccept their differences [226]. Culture is not restricted to different nationalities [227].\nConsider age, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, work experience, and education\n[227]. Communicate in a way sensitive to everyone's needs [228]. Cultural humility\nshould be your ultimate goal [228]. Remain curious about others and reflect on their\nviewpoints with an open mind [228].\nTwo types of sexual harassment exist [229]. Quid pro quo is when a harasser requests\nsexual favors for something else, like a promotion [229]. Hostile working environment\ncan involve jokes, touching, requesting a date, or talking about body parts [230]. The\nharasser's intent does not matter; the perception and impact of the behavior do [231].\nSince EMTs depend on each other for safety, developing non-adversarial\nrelationships is especially important [231]. Report harassment to your supervisor\nimmediately [232].\nSubstance abuse is another workplace issue [233]. It increases the risk of accidents\nand tension [233]. It causes poor treatment decisions [234]. Many EMS systems require\nperiodic random drug tests [235]. They also have for-cause testing when individuals\nare believed to be under the influence [235]. Addicts and alcoholics develop great\nskills at covering their behavior [236]. Seek help or confront an addicted coworker [237]\n. Allowing substance abuse presents a tremendous hazard to the public [237].\nEmployee assistance programs (EAPs) are often available [238].\nInjury and illness prevention is important [239]. EMS providers visit emergency\ndepartments for work-related injuries over 20,000 times each year [239]. Each\nprogram should include interrelated elements [240]. These elements include\nmanagement leadership and worker prevention [240]. Hazard identification and\nassessment are crucial [240].
