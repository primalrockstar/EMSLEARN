Introduction to Basic Life Support (BLS)\nBasic Life Support (BLS) is non-invasive emergency life-saving care used to treat\nmedical conditions like airway obstructions, respiratory arrest, and cardiac arrest [6].\nThe principles of BLS were introduced in 1960, and techniques have been regularly\nreviewed and revised [4].\nBLS focuses on the ABCs: Airway, Breathing, and Circulation [8].\nFor patients in cardiac arrest, the CAB sequence (Compressions, Airway,\nBreathing) is used because chest compressions are essential and must start\nquickly [9].\nOnly seconds should pass between recognizing the need for treatment and\nstarting bls [9].\nTime is critical for patients who are not breathing; permanent brain damage is\npossible if the brain is without oxygen for more than four to six minutes [10].\nBLS differs from Advanced Life Support (ALS), which includes advanced\nprocedures like cardiac monitoring and administering medications [19].\nWhen done correctly, BLS can maintain life temporarily until ALS measures can\nbegin [20].\nThe American Heart Association Chain of Survival includes six links that must all be\nfollowed [21].\nThese links are recognition and activation of the emergency response system,\nimmediate high-quality CPR, rapid defibrillation, basic and advanced emergency\nservices, advanced life support, post-arrest care, and recovery [23].\nIf any link is missing, the patient is more likely to die [25].\nFeature Basic Life Support (BLS) Advanced Life Support (ALS)\nNature Non-invasive emergency\nlife-saving care\nAdvanced procedures\nProcedures CPR, defibrillation, airway\nmanagement\nCardiac monitoring, IV fluids/medications,\nadvanced airway adjuncts\nGoal Treat conditions like\narrest/obstruction\nMaintain life until ALS measures can be\nstarted\nTime\nMaintained\nShort time Initiated after BLS\n2. Core Components of BLS: CPR and Defibrillation\nCardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) re-establishes circulation and artificial\nventilation in a patient who is not breathing and has no pulse [14].\nThe steps of CPR involve restoring circulation through high-quality chest\ncompressions and restoring breathing by opening the airway and providing rescue\nbreathing [15].\nAdminister two breaths over one second, visualizing for chest rise and fall [17].\nChest compressions involve applying rhythmic pressure and relaxation to the lower\nhalf of the sternum [49].\nCompression squeezes the heart to circulate blood [49].\nAvoid leaning on the chest between compressions to allow for complete recoil\n[49].\nInjuries can be minimized with proper technique and hand placement [50].\nCompression and relaxation should be rhythmic and of equal duration, a one-toone\nratio [53].\nThe sternum must return to its normal resting position between compressions\n[54].\nAn automated external defibrillator (AED) is a vital link in the chain of survival and\nshould be applied to a cardiac arrest patient as soon as possible [34].\nIf cardiac arrest is witnessed, begin CPR and then apply the AED immediately\n[36].\naed use in children differs: apply after the first five cycles of CPR (about two\nminutes) [37].\nUse pediatric-sized pads and a dose attenuating system [38].\nIf pediatric pads or attenuator are unavailable, use adult-sized pads with an\nanterior-posterior placement [39].\nFor patients with pacemakers or implanted defibrillators, place AED electrodes at\nleast one inch away from the device [40].\nIf the patient is wet or in water, pull them out and dry the skin before attaching AED\npads [41].\nIf in a small puddle or snow, the aed can be used, but the chest should be dried\n[42].\nRemove transdermal medication patches and wipe the skin before attaching AED\npads [42].\nFor CPR to be effective, the patient must be supine on a firm, flat surface [43].\nEnsure enough space for two rescuers [44].\nIf possible, log roll the patient onto a long backboard [45].\nQuickly check for breathing and a pulse simultaneously, taking no longer than 10\nseconds [46].\nVisualize the chest for signs of breathing and palpate for a carotid pulse [48].\nOne-rescuer adult CPR involves a continuous cycle of 30 compressions followed by\ntwo ventilations [67].\nTwo-rescuer adult CPR is preferred [69].\nRescuers can switch positions every two minutes to facilitate effective\ncompressions [70].\nBasic principles of bls are the same for infants, children, and adults, but the causes\nof arrest differ [30].\nCardiac arrest in adults usually follows respiratory arrest, while in infants and\nchildren, respiratory arrest typically causes cardiac arrest [31].\nAirway and breathing are the focus of pediatric BLS [80].\nFor effective chest compressions, the infant or child must be on a hard, flat surface\n[86].\nUse two fingers to compress an infant's chest [86].\nIf two rescuers are present for an infant, use the two-thumb encircling technique\n[86].\nIn children older than eight years old, the heel of one or both hands can be used\n[87].\nIf a child is not breathing but has a pulse, open the airway and deliver one breath\nevery two to three seconds (about 12 to 20 breaths a minute) [91].\nIf a child is not breathing and has no pulse, provide rescue breathing after every 30\ncompressions, or 15 compressions if two rescuers are present [92].\nMaintain a chest compression fraction greater than 80%, meaning compressions\nshould be performed for at least 80% of the total resuscitation time [100].\nAge Group Compression\nto Ventilation\nRatio (1\nRescuer)\nCompression\nto Ventilation\nRatio (2\nRescuers)\nHand\nPlacement\nCompression\nTechnique\nDepth\nAdult 30:2 [68] 30:2 [68] Lower half\nof sternum\n[49]\nHeel of one\nor both hands\nAt least 2\ninches\nChild (1\nyr+)\n30:2 [92] 15:2 [92] Heel of one\nor both\nhands\n(older\nchildren)\n[87]\nHeel of one\nor both hands\nAbout 2\ninches\nInfant 30:2 [92] 15:2 [92] Lower half\nof sternum\n[86]\nTwo fingers\n[86]\nAbout 1.5\ninches\nInfant Lower half\nof sternum\n(tworescuer)\n[86]\nTwo thumbs\nencircling [86]\nAbout 1.5\ninches\n3. Airway Management in BLS\nOpening the airway is the next step in BLS after starting cpr and applying an AED.\nIn non-traumatic adult patients, open the airway using a head tilt-chin lift maneuver\n[57].\nIf trauma is suspected, use the jaw thrust maneuver [57].\nRemove any foreign materials found in the mouth [57].\nIf the patient is breathing adequately and has no signs of head, spine, hip, or pelvis\ninjury, place them in the recovery position [58].\nThe recovery position maintains an open airway in an adequately breathing\npatient with a decreased level of consciousness who has no spinal injury [58].\nLack of oxygen (hypoxia) combined with too much carbon dioxide (hypercarbia) is\nlethal [59].\nIf the patient is not breathing, provide deliberate ventilations lasting for one second\n[59].\nVentilations can be given by one or two EMS providers [60].\nUse a barrier device such as a pocket mask with a one-way valve or a bag-valve\nmask [61].\nThese devices are used to supply supplemental oxygen when possible [61].\nArtificial ventilations may cause gastric distension (stomach filling with air), which\ncan lead to vomiting [64].\nBe ready with a suction unit in case the patient vomits [64].\nFor patients with a stoma (a surgical opening connecting the trachea to the skin),\nplace the bag mask or pocket mask device directly over the stoma to ventilate [63].\nA face mask with a one-way valve or barrier device over the tracheostomy site\ncan also be used [94].\nIn a child with a trach tube, remove the mask from the bag and connect it\ndirectly to the tube [93].\n4. Managing Foreign Body Airway Obstruction\nRecognize foreign body airway obstructions, remembering the most common cause\nin unresponsive patients is the relaxation of throat muscles, particularly the tongue\n[109].\nOther causes include vomited contents, blood, damaged tissue, dentures, food, or\nsmall objects [110].\nIn adults, airway obstruction usually occurs during a meal, while in children, it can\nhappen during a meal or at play [111].\nWith a mild airway obstruction, the patient can exchange an adequate amount of air\nbut shows signs of respiratory distress [112].\nLeave patients with mild obstruction alone and observe for signs of severe\nobstruction, continuing to reassess [113].\nA sudden severe obstruction is usually easy to recognize in responsive patients [115].\nThe patient suddenly cannot speak or cough, may grasp their throat, turn\ncyanotic, and make exaggerated breathing efforts; stridor might also be present\n[116].\nIn unresponsive patients, suspect airway obstruction if maneuvers to open the\nairway and ventilate are ineffective [117].\nTo remove a foreign airway obstruction in adults and children older than one year,\nuse the abdominal thrust maneuver (Heimlich maneuver) [118].\nThis maneuver creates an artificial cough [119].\nIf a patient with a severe airway obstruction becomes unresponsive, perform chest\ncompressions [120].\nInstead of abdominal thrusts, use chest thrusts for women in advanced stages of\npregnancy and obese patients [123].\nIf a responsive patient becomes unresponsive due to airway obstruction, lower\nthem to the ground, call for help, and start 30 chest compressions [127].\nDo not check for a pulse before starting compressions [128].\nOpen the airway and look in the mouth; if a visible object can be easily removed,\nremove it with a finger [129].\nIf no object is seen, continue chest compressions [130].\nRepeat the sequence until the obstruction is relieved or als takes over [131].\nIn unresponsive patients, after checking for breathing and a pulse, if a pulse is\npresent but breathing is absent, open the airway and attempt to ventilate [132].\nIf the first ventilation doesn't cause chest rise, reposition the airway and attempt\nagain [134].\nIf both attempts fail, perform 30 compressions, open the airway, look for and\ncarefully remove any visible object, then attempt to ventilate again [135].\nIn children with signs of airway obstruction, do not waste time trying to dislodge the\nobject if they can still breathe, cough, or talk; administer supplemental oxygen if\nneeded and transport immediately [136].\nIf they can breathe, cough, or talk, do not interfere [138].\nFor a responsive, standing, or sitting child, perform the heimlich maneuver with less\nforce than on an adult [140].\nAn unresponsive child older than one year with airway obstruction is managed like\nan adult [141].\nFor responsive infants, perform back slaps and chest thrusts (compressions) [143].\nHold the infant face down on your forearm with the head lower than the body\n[144].\nGive five back blows between the shoulder blades with the heel of your hand\n[146].\nRoll the infant over and give five quick chest thrusts with two fingers on the\nlower half of the sternum [146].\nIn unresponsive infants, begin chest compressions immediately; do not check for a\npulse [148].\nOpen the airway and look in the mouth; if a visible object can be easily removed,\nremove it [150].\nIf no object is seen, resume chest compressions [152].\nContinue the sequence of compressions, opening the airway, and looking in the\nmouth until the obstruction is relieved or als takes over [153].\nAge/Situation Responsive Patient Unresponsive Patient\nAdult/Child (>1 yr) Heimlich maneuver\n(abdominal thrusts) [118]\nChest compressions [120]\nPregnant/Obese\nAdult\nChest thrusts [123] Chest compressions (after\nbecoming unresponsive) [127]\nChild (signs of\nobstruction)\nObserve, transport if\nneeded, supplement oxygen\nif tolerated [136]\nChest compressions (managed like\nadult if >1 yr) [141], open airway,\nlook, remove [150]\nInfant Back slaps and chest\nthrusts [143]\nChest compressions [148], open\nairway, look, remove [150]\n5. Special Considerations and When to Stop BLS\nThere are special circumstances to consider during bls [154].\nFor opiate overdoses, EMTs may administer narcan to reverse the arrest [155].\nIn cardiac arrest during pregnancy, the priority is high-quality cpr [155].\nIf the uterus is felt at or above the umbilicus, perform manual displacement of\nthe uterus to the patient's left to relieve compression on the great vessels\nwhile doing cpr [155].\nIf not in cardiac arrest, position the pregnant patient on her left side [155].\nThere are three general rules for when not to start cpr [102].\nIf the scene is unsafe [102].\nIf the patient has obvious signs of death along with absence of pulse and\nbreathing [102].\nObvious signs of death include rigor mortis (stiffening), dependent\nlividity/liver mortis (purple discoloration), putrefaction (decomposition), or\nevidence of a non-survivable injury [103].\nIf the patient and physician have previously agreed on Do Not Resuscitate (DNR)\norders [106].\nOnce cpr begins, continue until one of the following events occurs, using the STOP\nmnemonic [106].\nMnemonic Meaning Explanation\nS Patient starts breathing and has a\npulse [106]\nIndicates a return of spontaneous\ncirculation.\nT Patient is transferred to another\nprovider of equal or higher training\n[107]\nHanding over care to qualified\npersonnel.\nO You are out of strength [107] Physically unable to continue CPR,\nnot just tired.\nP Physician directs you to discontinue\n[107]\nMedical command provides an\norder to stop resuscitation efforts.\n6. Importance of Training and Support\nOngoing education and training are crucial for EMTs [164].\ncpr skills can deteriorate over time [164].\nPractice often using mannequin-based training [164].\ncpr self-instruction through video or computer-based modules with hands-on\npractice can be an alternative to instructor-led courses [165].\nEducation and training for the public are also very important [166].\nEMTs are patient advocates responsible for facilitating training of lay people in\ncpr and aed operation [166].\nIf asked to train community members in hands-only cpr, consider it a\nprofessional responsibility [167].\nGrief support for family members and loved ones is a significant aspect of care [156].\nFamily members may experience a psychological crisis [156].\nThey will remember the event in detail for the rest of their lives [157].\nAppropriate and supportive care at the onset of grief can positively affect their\ngrieving process [157].\nKeep the family informed throughout the resuscitation process [158].\nDesignate one provider to communicate the patient's status clearly and\nconcisely [158].\nAfter resuscitation has stopped, helpful measures include taking the family to a\nquiet, private place, introducing yourself, using clear language, and speaking in a\nwarm, sensitive, and caring manner [159].\nExhibit calm, reassuring authority, use the patient's name, and use eye contact\nand appropriate touch [160].\nAccept that family members will show emotion; be supportive but do not hover\n[161].\nAsk if a friend or family member can be called for support [162].\nWhen leaving, turn the family member over to someone and ensure children are\nnot ignored [163].",
