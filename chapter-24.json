Introduction to Gynecologic Emergencies\nWelcome to chapter 24 on gynecologic emergencies. [1]\nAfter this chapter, you will understand the female reproductive system. [2]\nYou will also identify and describe assessment and treatment for gynecologic\nemergencies. [2]\nSpecial considerations for sexual assault cases are also discussed. [3]\n2. Anatomy and Physiology of the Female Reproductive System\nStructure Location/Description Function\nExternal\nGenitalia\nVaginal opening, labia, clitoris,\nperineum\n[5]\nOvaries Each side of the lower abdomen Produce an ovum (egg)\n[6]\nFallopian tubes Connect each ovary to the uterus Fertilization occurs\nhere [15]\nUterus Muscular organ Fetus grows here\nduring pregnancy [8]\nCervix Narrowest part of the uterus, opens\ninto the vagina\n[8]\nVagina Outermost cavity of the reproductive\nsystem\n[9]\nMenarche Onset of menstruation, typically ages\n11-16\nIndicates capability of\npregnancy [11]\nMenopause End of menstrual activity, usually\naround 50 years old\n[12]\nOvulation Release of one ovum into the fallopian\ntubes each month\n[13]\nFertilization Begins in the vagina, sperm travels to\nfallopian tubes\nEmbryo travels to\nuterus and grows [14]\nMenstruation Occurs if fertilization does not happen\nwithin 14 days of ovulation\nUterine lining\nseparates [16]\nFemale\nHormones\nProduced primarily in the ovaries Control ovulation and\nmenstruation [17]\n3. Common Gynecologic Emergencies: Pathophysiology and\nSymptoms\nCondition Pathophysiology Common Symptoms Risk Factors\nPelvic\nInflammatory\nDisease (PID)\nInfection of upper\nreproductive organs\n(fallopian tubes,\novaries) [20]\nGeneralized lower\nabdominal pain [23],\nabnormal or foulsmelling\nvaginal\ndischarge [24],\nincreased pain with\nintercourse [24], fever\n[24], general malaise\nMultiple sexual\npartners [25],\nuntreated STDs\n[26], history of\nPID [26],\nsexually active\nunder 26 [26],\n[24], nausea and\nvomiting [24]\ndouching [26],\nIUD use [26]\nSexually\nTransmitted\nDiseases\n(STDs)\nInfections spread\nthrough sexual\ncontact [27]\nCan be mild or absent\n[30], can lead to PID [28]\n, premature birth or low\nbirth weight (Bacterial\nVaginosis) [33],\nsusceptible to other\ninfections (Bacterial\nVaginosis) [33],\ncramping [35],\nabdominal pain [35],\nnausea [35], vomiting\n[35], bleeding between\nperiods (Gonorrhea)\n[35], spread to other\nbody parts (Gonorrhea\nuntreated) [36]\nMultiple sexual\npartners [25],\nuntreated STDs\n[26]\n- Chlamydia Most common STD\nin the US [29],\ninfection of cervix\ncan spread to rectum\nand progress to PID\n[31]\nUsually milder, absent\nsymptoms [30]\n- Bacterial\nVaginosis\nMost common\ninfection for women\naged 15-44 [32]\nUntreated can lead to\npremature birth or low\nbirth weight in\npregnancy [33], makes\npatient more\nsusceptible to other\ninfections [33], can\ncause PID [33]\n- Gonorrhea Caused by bacteria\nthat grow in warm,\nmoist areas of\nreproductive tract\n[34]\nSevere infections\npresent with cramping,\nabdominal pain,\nnausea, vomiting, and\nbleeding between\nperiods [35]\nVaginal\nBleeding\nCauses include\nabnormal\nmenstruation, vaginal\ntrauma, ectopic\npregnancy,\nspontaneous\nabortion, polyps, or\ncancer [38]\nVisible bleeding [57],\nquality and quantity\nimportant to note [60]\n4. Patient Assessment in Gynecologic Emergencies\nObtaining an accurate and detailed assessment is critical. [40]\nScene safety is the first step. [42]\nAsk about assistance needed and number of patients. [42]\nDetermine the nature of the illness. [42]\nTake standard precautions, as large amounts of blood and body fluids may be\npresent. [42]\nDocument accurately, especially if it's a crime scene. [44]\nInvolve the police if assault is suspected. [45]\nA female EMT should provide care in sexual assault cases if possible. [45]\nThe primary assessment includes forming a general impression. [47]\nUse the AVPU scale for level of consciousness. [47]\nEvaluate airway and breathing immediately. [48]\nPalpate pulse and evaluate skin color, temperature, and moisture to identify\nblood loss. [49]\nMost gynecologic emergencies are not life-threatening. [50]\nIf signs of shock are present, transport is warranted. [51]\nHistory taking involves investigating the chief complaint. [52]\nBe sensitive as questions may be personal. [52]\nProtect the patient's privacy and dignity. [52]\nFor abdominal pain, use OPQRST. [53]\nAsk about associated symptoms like syncope, nausea, vomiting, or fever. [54]\nFor vaginal bleeding, follow OPQRST with SAMPLE history. [54]\nAsk about birth control, medical conditions, and last menstrual period. [54]\nThe secondary assessment focuses on the chief complaint area. [56]\nCheck vital signs. [57]\nAssess the abdomen for distension or tenderness. [57]\nNote visible bleeding and mental status. [57]\nPhysical exams should be limited and professional. [58]\nOnly examine genitalia if necessary for treatment. [58]\nFor vaginal bleeding, visualize the bleeding. [60]\nAsk about the quality and quantity of bleeding. [60]\nObserve for vaginal discharge. [60]\nFever, nausea, and vomiting are significant in gynecologic emergencies. [61]\nSyncope is also significant and treat as if in shock. [61]\nVital signs include heart rate, respiratory rate, skin condition, cap refill, and\nblood pressure. [62]\nConsider orthostatic vital signs if bleeding is known or suspected. [62]\n5. Emergency Care and Special Considerations\nPrinciple Description\nMaintain Privacy Get the patient to a private location if possible.\n[63]\nFemale EMT Participation Have a female EMT participate in patient care if\npossible. [63]\nManaging Vaginal Bleeding Use sanitary pads on external genitalia to absorb\nblood. [64]\nDocument the number of saturated pads. [65]\nTreat external lacerations, abrasions, or tears\nwith sterile compresses. [66]\nNever pack or place dressings in the vagina.\n[67]\nAssessment and\nManagement of PID\nPatient will complain of abdominal pain. [68]\nPain usually starts during or after menstruation.\n[69]\nPain may be worse with walking, causing a\nshuffling gait. [70]\nPrehospital treatment is limited. [71]\nNon-emergency transport is usually\nrecommended. [71]\nConsiderations for Sexual\nAssault Victims\nSexual assault and rape are common in the US.\n[72]\nEMTs face medical, psychological, and legal\nissues. [73]\nProfessionalism, tact, kindness, and sensitivity\nare important. [74]\nBe aware of drugs used to incapacitate a person.\n[75]\nOffer the patient the option of being treated by a\nfemale EMT. [76]\nFocus on medical treatment, psychological care,\nand evidence preservation. [77]\nPersuade the patient not to clean themselves if\npossible. [78]\nOffer to call the local Rape Crisis Center. [79]\nLimit physical exam to a brief survey for lifethreatening\ninjuries. [79]\n6. Key Takeaways and Review\nQ: What is the narrowest portion of the uterus? A: The cervix.
