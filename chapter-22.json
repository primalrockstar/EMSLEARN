Introduction to Toxicology and Poisoning\ntoxicology is the study of toxic or poisonous substances [5].\nA poison is any substance that can damage body structures or impair body\nfunction through chemical action [6].\nA toxin is a poisonous substance produced by bacteria, animals, or plants [7].\ntoxins act by changing normal cell metabolism or destroying cells [8].\ntoxins can have either acute (fast) or chronic (slower) effects [8].\nsubstance abuse is misusing any substance to produce a desired effect [9].\noverdosing is a common complication, occurring when a patient takes a\ntoxic dose [9].\nacute poisonings affect over 2 million people annually [4].\nchronic poisonings are more common [4].\nDeaths from poisonings are fairly rare [5].\nChild deaths from poisoning have decreased since the 1960s due to childresistant\ncaps [5].\nAdult deaths from chronic poisoning are rising due to drug abuse [5].\nRecognizing that a poisoning has occurred is your primary responsibility [10].\nPay attention to your surroundings for your own safety to avoid exposure [10].\nEven small amounts of some poisons can cause considerable damage or\ndeath [11].\nIf you suspect toxic substance ingestion or exposure, notify medical control\nimmediately [12].\nBegin emergency treatment at once [12].\nPoisoning Type Onset Duration\nAcute Sudden onset [4] Fast effects [8]\nChronic Longer-term [4] Slower effects [8]\n2. Routes of Poison Exposure\nHow you treat poisoning depends on how the poison entered the body [17].\nThere are four main routes of poison entry [17].\ninhalation [18]\nabsorption (surface contact) [18]\ningestion [18]\ninjection [18]\nAll four routes can lead to life-threatening conditions [18].\nRoute Description Initial Emergency Actions\nInhalation Breathing in\npoisonous\nsubstances [18]\nMove patient to fresh air [18]. Provide supplemental\noxygen [19]. Call Hazmat for toxic gas [19].\nImmediate transport [20]. Suction available [21].\nAbsorption Contact with\nskin or mucous\nmembranes [18]\nAvoid self-contamination [25]. Remove substance\nand contaminated clothing [25]. Flush and wash\nskin (brush dry powder first) [26]. Irrigate eyes [28].\nHazmat assistance [29]. Decontaminate thoroughly\n[29]. Prompt transport [30]. Obtain material safety\ndata sheet [31].\nIngestion Swallowing\npoisonous\nsubstances [18]\nTreat signs and symptoms [36]. Notify poison\ncontrol and medical control [36]. Protect airway if\naltered mental status [37]. Consider preventing\nfurther absorption (e.g., activated charcoal) [37].\nInjection Entry via\nneedle or bite\n[18]\nMonitor airway, provide high flow oxygen [40]. Be\nalert for nausea and vomiting [40]. Remove\nrings/watches/bracelets from injection site [41].\nCannot be diluted or removed in the field [38].\nPrompt transport [38].\n3. Patient Assessment in Poisoning Emergencies\nPatient assessment for toxins begins with scene size-up [42].\nScene size-up involves standard precautions [43].\nLook for clues like odors, bottles, syringes, pills, or chemicals [43].\nCheck for missing medication or drug paraphernalia [44].\nBe aware of potential drug labs [44].\nKeep an open mind and avoid mistaken conclusions [44].\nPrimary assessment determines the patient's condition severity [45].\nObtain a general impression [45].\nAssess level of consciousness and life threats [45].\nDo not assume a conscious patient is stable [45].\nAssess the ABCs and D [46].\nAirway and Breathing: Ensure an open airway and adequate ventilation [46]\n.\nProvide oxygen therapy for difficulty breathing [47].\nConsider airway adjuncts for unresponsive patients [47].\nHave suction ready as patients are susceptible to vomiting [48].\nCirculation: Assess pulse and skin condition [49]. Variations depend on the\nsubstance [49].\nTransport decision: Prompt transport for patients with altered ABCs or a\npoor general impression [50].\nHazardous material exposures require thorough decontamination by\nHazmat before transport [51].\nHistory taking is next, if the patient is responsive [52].\nInvestigate the chief complaint [52].\nObtain a sample history [53].\nAsk specific questions about the substance: what, when, how much, over\nwhat period, interventions used, and patient weight [54].\nIf the patient is unresponsive, get history from other sources [53].\nSecondary assessment focuses on the exposure route or affected body area\n[56].\nReview all body systems to identify systemic problems [57].\nObtain a complete set of baseline vital signs [58].\nChanges in consciousness, pulse, respirations, blood pressure, and skin\nindicate serious issues [58].\nReassessment is continuous [59].\nContinually check ABCs adequacy [59].\nRepeat vital signs and compare to baseline [59].\nEvaluate intervention effectiveness [60].\nTake vital signs every 15 minutes for stable patients, every 5 minutes for\nunstable patients or those who ingested a harmful dose [60].\n4. General Treatment and Activated Charcoal\nGeneral treatment principles involve supporting the ABCs [61]. This is the most\nimportant task [61].\nContact medical control or a poison center to discuss treatment [62].\nManage airborne exposures with oxygen [62].\nRemove contact exposures with copious water, unless contraindicated [62].\nConsider activated charcoal for ingested poisons [62].\nactivated charcoal binds to specific toxins [64].\nIt prevents toxin absorption in the body [64].\ntoxins are carried out in the stool [65].\nactivated charcoal is not indicated for certain ingestions [66].\nThese include alkali poisons, cyanide, ethanol, iron, lithium, methanol,\nmineral acids, or organic solvents [67].\nPatients with a decreased level of consciousness should not receive activated\ncharcoal because they cannot protect their airway [68].\nactivated charcoal often comes as a pre-mixed suspension, typically 50\ngrams per bottle [69].\nThe usual dose is one gram per kilogram of body weight for adults or children\n[69].\nAlways call medical control for pre-approval before administering activated\ncharcoal [70].\nShake the bottle vigorously to mix [71].\nConvince the patient to drink it, but never force them [71].\nRecord the time of administration [72].\nIf the patient refuses, document the refusal and your attempts to counsel\nthem [72].\nTransport the patient for further evaluation [72].\nSide effects of activated charcoal include constipation and black stools [73].\nIf the patient vomits after taking charcoal, the dose may need to be repeated\n[74].\nIndication Contraindication\nIngestion of\ncertain toxins\nIngestion of alkali poison, cyanide, ethanol, iron, lithium,\nmethanol, mineral acids, or organic solvents [67]\nPrevent toxin\nabsorption\nDecreased level of consciousness (unable to protect airway)\n[68]\nToxins carried out\nin stool\n5. Specific Types of Poisons and Their Management\ntolerance is when a person needs increasing amounts of a substance to\nachieve the same result [76]. This builds up over time [212].\naddiction is an overwhelming desire to continue using a substance, often\nincreasing the dose [77].\nSafety awareness and standard precautions are crucial when caring for drug\nabusers [78].\nKnown drug abusers have a high incidence of serious infections like HIV\nand hepatitis [79].\nThe drug user, not the drug, can pose the greatest threat [80].\nAlcohol is a central nervous system depressant, sedative, and hypnotic [85].\nIt dulls senses, slows reflexes, and reduces reaction time [87].\nIt can cause aggressive behavior and lack of coordination [88].\nBinge drinking (occasional heavy use) can be very damaging [84].\nSevere acute ingestion can cause hypoglycemia [90]. Check blood sugar\nlevels [90].\nAlcohol increases the effects of other drugs [91].\nProvide respiratory support for severe CNS depression [92]. Emesis can\nresult from respiratory depression [93].\nAlcohol withdrawal can cause hallucinations or delirium tremens (DTs) [94].\nDTs include agitation, restlessness, fever, sweating, tremors, confusion,\ndelusions, or seizures [95].\nWithdrawal symptoms can occur after stopping or reducing alcohol\nintake [96].\nProvide transport, reassurance, care, and emotional support for\nwithdrawal [96]. Withdrawal is as dangerous as too much alcohol [96].\nopiates are narcotics that produce sleep and altered consciousness [98].\nThey are used for pain relief [99].\nPrescription opiates are commonly abused [100]. Physical dependence can\ndevelop from medical prescriptions [101].\nopiates are CNS depressants and cause severe respiratory depression [101]\n. This can lead to cardiac arrest [101].\ntolerance develops quickly; users may need massive doses [102].\nNausea and vomiting are common [104]. Hypotension can occur [104].\nSeizures are uncommon but possible [104].\nPatients are typically sedated, unconscious, cyanotic with pinpoint pupils\n[105].\nnaloxone (Narcan) reverses opiate/opioid overdose effects [105]. It can be\ngiven IV, IM, or IN [106].\nEMTs often administer naloxone intranasally (IN) [107]. Use it for agonal\nrespirations or apnea due to opioids [108].\nAsk bystanders if naloxone was given before your arrival [111].\nSedative-Hypnotic Drugs (barbiturates, benzodiazepines) are CNS\ndepressants that alter consciousness [112].\nThey are easily obtained and relatively cheap [112].\nEffects are similar to alcohol; patients may be drowsy, peaceful, or\nintoxicated [113].\nTaken orally, sometimes dissolved or injected [115].\ntolerance develops quickly, requiring larger doses [116].\nCan be used as \"knockout drugs\" [117].\nTreatment: Ensure patent airway, assist ventilations, and provide prompt\ntransport [118].\nabused inhalants are agents inhaled rather than ingested or injected [119].\nInclude acetone, glue, cleaning compounds, paint thinners, lacquers,\ngasoline, Freon [121].\nCommonly abused by teenagers [123].\nEffects range from drowsiness to coma and seizures [123].\nHydrocarbon solvents make the heart hypersensitive to adrenaline [123].\nKeep patients from struggling or exerting themselves [123].\nProvide oxygen and transport [123].\nhydrogen sulfide is a highly toxic, odorless, flammable gas with a rotten\negg smell [124]. It affects lungs and CNS [125]. Used in \"detergent suicides\"\n[125].\nBe alert for warning signs, containers, buckets in enclosed vehicles\n[125]. Wait for Hazmat to declare the scene safe [125].\nSigns include nausea, vomiting, confusion, dyspnea, loss of\nconsciousness, seizures, shock, coma, cardiopulmonary arrest [126].\nAfter decontamination, management is supportive: monitor respiratory\nand cardiovascular function, provide rapid transport [127].\nCentral Nervous System Stimulants (sympathomimetics) mimic the\nsympathetic nervous system [129].\nThey cause hypertension, tachycardia, and dilated pupils [130].\nProduce an excited state [131].\nExamples: amphetamines, methamphetamines, MDMA (ecstasy/Molly),\ncocaine [131].\nCocaine can be absorbed through mucous membranes or skin [132].\nEffects last less than an hour [132]. Smoking cocaine (crack) gives the\nfastest and most potent effect [133].\nAcute overdose is an emergency due to high risk of seizures, cardiac\ndysrhythmias, and stroke [133].\nPatients may have hallucinations or paranoia [134].\nLaw enforcement may need to restrain the patient [134]. Do not leave\nunattended during transport [135].\nProvide prompt transport, supplemental oxygen, and be ready to suction\n[135].\nbath salts are synthetic drugs similar to MDMA [136].\nSold as bath salts to evade legal restrictions [139].\nProduce euphoria, increased mental clarity, and sexual arousal [140]. Users\noften snort it [140]. Effects can last 48 hours [140].\nAdverse effects: teeth grinding, appetite loss, muscle twitching, lip\nsmacking, confusion, GI issues, paranoia, headache, elevated heart rate,\nhallucinations [141].\nKeep the patient calm and transport [141]. Consider advanced life support;\nchemical restraint may be needed for safe transport [142].\nmarijuana contains thc, which produces the high [143].\nInhaling smoke causes euphoria, relaxation, drowsiness [144].\nImpairs short-term memory and complex thinking [145].\nHigh doses can cause depression, confusion, hallucinations, anxiety,\nparanoia [146].\nOften used to introduce other drugs [148].\nEdibles (baked goods, candies with thc) can cause cannabinoid\nhyperemesis syndrome [149].\nThis is extreme nausea and vomiting in chronic users, relieved only by\nhot showers/baths [150].\nSynthetic marijuana (spice) mimics thc effects but can have powerful and\nunpredictable outcomes [151]. Effects range from euphoria to loss of\nconsciousness [151].\nHallucinogens alter sensory perceptions [152].\nLSD (acid) is a classic example [153].\nCause visual hallucinations, intensify vision/hearing, separate user from\nreality [153].\nA \"bad trip\" can include hypertension, tachycardia, anxiety, paranoia [154].\nCare is similar to sympathomimetic overdose: use a calm, professional\nmanner [155].\nProvide emotional support [156]. Avoid restraints unless the patient is in\ndanger [157].\nWatch the patient carefully; never leave unattended during transport [158].\nRequest advanced life support if appropriate [158].\nAnticholinergic Agents block parasympathetic nerves [159].\nClassic signs: \"hot as a hare, blind as a bat, dry as a bone, red as a beet,\nand mad as a hatter\" [160].\nCommon examples: atropine, Benadryl, gypsum weed, Elavil [160].\nDifficult to distinguish from sympathomimetic overdose; both can cause\nagitation, high heart rate, dilated pupils [160].\nTricyclic antidepressants have significant anticholinergic effects [161].\nDeath can be rapid (normal to seizure/death in 30 mins) [161].\nImmediate transport is crucial [161]. Consider calling advanced life support\n[161].\nCholinergic Agents overstimulate parasympathetic functions [162].\nInclude nerve gas (chemical warfare) and organophosphate insecticides\n[162].\nSigns are easy to remember using mnemonics \"DUMBELS\" or \"SLUDGE M\"\n[164].\nDUMBELS: Diarrhea, Urination, Miosis, Bradycardia, Emesis,\nLacrimation, Seizures [164].\nSLUDGE M: Salivation, Lacrimation, Urination, Defecation, Gastric\nupsets, Emesis, Muscle twitching [165].\nAnticholinergics have the exact opposite effects [166].\nAvoiding self-exposure is the most important consideration [167].\nDecontamination is a priority [167]. hazmat teams often provide\ndecontamination [168].\nAfter decontamination, priorities are decreasing mouth/trachea secretions\nand providing airway support [168].\nAntidote kits exist for cholinergic agents, e.g., DuoDote auto-injector [169].\nDuoDote contains atropine and pralidoxime [170]. Use for known nerve\nagent/organophosphate exposure with symptoms [170]. You may need to\nuse it on yourself [170].\nMiscellaneous Drugs include various classifications [171].\nCardiac medicines: Accidental or intentional overdose [171]. Children may\nthink they are candy; older adults may forget doses [171]. Symptoms vary\nby medication [172]. Contact poison control ASAP [172].\nAspirin: Ingesting too much can cause nausea, vomiting, hyperventilation,\nringing in ears [173]. Patients may have anxiety, confusion, tachypnea,\nhyperthermia, and be in danger of seizures [174].\nAcetaminophen: Overdose is common and serious, whether accidental or\nintentional [175].\nAlcohols (methyl or ethyl glycol) are more toxic than drinking alcohol [175].\nThey cause severe tachypnea, blindness, renal failure, and potentially\ndeath [175].\nFood Poisoning: Caused by bacteria or toxins [176].\nSalmonella bacterium causes severe GI symptoms (nausea, vomiting,\nabdominal pain, diarrhea) within 72 hours [176]. Proper cooking and\nkitchen cleanliness prevent it [178].\nStaphylococcus bacteria grow quickly in unrefrigerated leftovers and\nproduce toxins [179]. Symptoms start suddenly (nausea, vomiting,\ndiarrhea) within 2-12 hours [181].\nBotulism is the most severe form, resulting from improperly canned\nfood [182]. Bacterial spores grow and produce a toxin [184]. Symptoms\nare neurologic: blurred vision, weakness, difficulty speaking/breathing\n[185]. It can be fatal; symptoms develop within 24 hours to 4 days [186].\nDo not try to determine the specific food poisoning cause in acute\ncases [187]. Gather history and transport promptly [187]. Take suspected\nfood if multiple people are ill [188].\nPlant Poisonings: Tens of thousands of cases annually [189]. Many\nhousehold plants are poisonous [190].\nEffects vary: local skin irritation, effects on circulatory/GI/CNS systems\n[191].\nImpossible to memorize all poisonous plants and effects [192].\nAssess airway and vital signs [193]. Notify poison control for plant\nidentification assistance [193]. Take the plant with you to the hospital\n[193].\nType Key Characteristics/Effects Management Highlights\nAlcohol CNS depressant,\nsedative/hypnotic; dulled\nsenses, slowed reflexes, lack\nof coordination; withdrawal\n(DTs)\nRespiratory support if\nneeded; reassure patient\nduring withdrawal, provide\ncare and support [92]\nOpiates CNS depressant; severe\nrespiratory depression,\npinpoint pupils, sedation;\ntolerance develops quickly\nNaloxone (Narcan) to reverse\neffects, especially for\nrespiratory depression [105]\nSedative-\nHypnotics\nCNS depressant; alter\nconsciousness,\ndrowsy/intoxicated state;\ntolerance develops quickly\nEnsure patent airway, assist\nventilations, prompt\ntransport [118]\nAbused Inhalants Inhaled; drowsiness to coma,\nseizures; heart\nhypersensitive to adrenaline\n(hydrocarbons); rotten egg\nsmell (hydrogen sulfide)\nKeep patients calm, provide\noxygen, transport [123].

Case Studies and Review Questions\nUnderstanding key questions for poisoning assessment is important [198].\nAsking why a patient intentionally overdosed is the least pertinent EMT\nquestion [198].\nIf a patient vomits after ingesting a substance, collect the vomit to bring to the\nhospital and look for pill fragments [200].\nWhen caring for a surface contact poisoning, the first priority is to avoid\ncontaminating yourself [204].\nMost poisonings occur via ingestion, accounting for about 80% of cases [205].\nactivated charcoal dosage is calculated based on patient weight in kilograms\n[206]. The dose is one gram per kilogram [206]. To convert pounds to kilograms,\ndivide by 2.2 [206]. A 55-pound child needs about 25 grams [206].\nWhen a person needs increasing amounts of a substance to achieve the same\neffect over time, this is called developing tolerance [210].\nBinge drinking does not increase a sense of awareness; it typically causes a\ndull sense of awareness [213].\nAn unconscious patient with slow and shallow respirations, slow/weak pulse,\nand constricted (pinpoint) pupils is consistent with an opioid overdose [215].\nThis patient would likely need naloxone [217].\nThe mnemonic \"DUMBELS\" helps recall the signs and symptoms of a\ncholinergic drug overdose [218]. The \"E\" in DUMBELS stands for emesis\n(vomiting) [218].\nFood poisoning is almost always caused by eating foods containing bacteria,\nsuch as salmonella [218].",
