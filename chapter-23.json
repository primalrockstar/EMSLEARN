Introduction to Behavioral Health Emergencies\nCommon Causes of Behavioral Crises\nAcute medical situation [6]\nMental illness [6]\nMind-altering substance [6]\nStress [6]\nOther causes [6]\nThis report covers behavioral health emergencies for EMTs [1].\nEMTs will learn to recognize behaviors that pose a risk [2].\nThis includes risks to the EMT, patient, and others [2].\nBasic principles of the mental health system are also discussed [2].\nEMTs often care for patients experiencing behavioral crisis emergencies [5].\nThese crises can result from acute medical situations, mental illness, mindaltering\nsubstances, or stress [6].\nBehavior is defined as a person's response to the environment over time [19].\nNormal coping mechanisms may not be enough during great stress [20].\nNegative coping mechanisms like withdrawing or using drugs and alcohol may\nbe used [20].\nReactions to stress can create a crisis [21].\nA change in behavior may be considered inappropriate [22].\nA behavioral crisis includes patients of all ages [23].\nPatients may exhibit agitated, violent, or uncooperative behavior [23].\nThey may also be a danger to themselves or others [23].\nEMS is called when behavior becomes unacceptable [24].\n2. Understanding Mental Health Disorders and Crises\nMost people experience an emotional crisis at some point [7].\nThis does not mean everyone develops a mental illness [7].\nOtherwise healthy people can have temporary mental health disorders [8].\nDo not assume a patient is mentally ill [9].\nFeeling bad or depressed doesn't mean you are sick [10].\nThere are justifiable reasons for depression [11].\nExamples include divorce, job loss, or death of a loved one [11].\nThis is a normal reaction to an acute crisis [12].\nIt is a misconception that all individuals with mental health disorders are\ndangerous [13].\nOnly a small percentage of people with mental health problems are violent [14].\nEMTs may see more violent patients [15].\nThis is because they are seeing patients in a behavioral crisis [15].\nMental health disorders are common in the United States [28].\nThey affect tens of millions of people each year [28].\nA psychiatric disorder has psychological or behavioral symptoms [29].\nThis may result in impaired functioning [29].\nAnxiety disorders are among the most common mental health disorders [30].\nThese include generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and phobias [31].\nPost-traumatic stress disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder are also\ncommon [32].\n3. Underlying Causes and Pathophysiology\nOrganic Disorders Functional Disorders\nPhysical condition [43] Psychological condition [43]\nTemporary or permanent brain dysfunction [45] Impair body function when\nstructurally normal [49]\nCaused by disturbance in brain tissue\nfunctioning [45]\nInclude schizophrenia, some\nanxiety conditions, and\ndepression [50]\nCauses: sudden illness, TBI, seizure disorder,\ndrug/alcohol abuse, overdose, withdrawal,\nAlzheimer's, meningitis [46]\nAltered mental status from: hypoglycemia,\nhypoxia, impaired cerebral blood flow,\nhyperthermia, hypothermia [47]\nBehavioral health disorders have many underlying causes [36].\nThese can include social or situational stress [37].\nExamples are divorce or death of a loved one [37].\nDiseases like schizophrenia can be a cause [38].\nPhysical illnesses such as a diabetic emergency can also contribute [38].\nChemical problems like alcohol or drug use are causes [38].\nBiological disturbances such as electrolyte imbalance can be involved [38].\nThese conditions can be compounded by not taking prescribed medications\n[39].\nEMTs are not responsible for diagnosing the underlying cause [41].\nThey should understand organic and functional diagnoses [42].\nAn organic disorder is a physical condition [43].\nA functional disorder is a psychological condition [43].\norganic brain syndrome is brain dysfunction [45].\nIt can be temporary or permanent [45].\nCauses include sudden illness, traumatic brain injury, or seizure disorder\n[46].\nDrug and alcohol abuse or withdrawal can cause it [46].\nDiseases like Alzheimer's and meningitis are causes [46].\nAltered mental status can come from hypoglycemia or hypoxia [47].\nImpaired cerebral blood flow can also cause it [47].\nhyperthermia or hypothermia can alter mental status [47].\nfunctional disorders impair body function [49].\nThe body seems structurally normal in functional disorders [49].\nExamples include schizophrenia and depression [50].\n4. Patient Assessment in Behavioral Health Emergencies\nA safe approach is crucial for behavioral crises [50].\nPatient assessment begins with the scene size-up [51].\nScene safety is the first consideration [51].\nAssess the patient's response to the environment [51].\nDetermine if the situation is dangerous for you and your partner [51].\nImmediate law enforcement backup may be needed [51].\nYou might need to stage until law enforcement secures the scene [51].\nNote any medications or substances the patient is taking [53].\nThis could contribute to the complaint or be a treatment [53].\nForm a general impression during the primary assessment [54].\nBegin assessment from a safe distance, like the doorway [54].\nPerform a rapid physical exam [54].\nObserve the patient closely [54].\nUse the AVPU scale to check for alertness [54].\nEstablish a rapport with the patient [55].\nAssess the airway to ensure it is open and adequate [55].\nEvaluate the patient's breathing rate and effort [56].\nUse pulse oximetry if available [57].\nProvide appropriate interventions based on findings [57].\nAssess the pulse rate, rhythm, and quality [58].\nEvaluate for shock and bleeding [59].\nAssess the patient's perfusion [59].\nEvaluate skin color, temperature, and capillary refill [60].\nSpend time with the patient if medically stable [61].\nTake a SAMPLE history for a medical patient [62].\nConsider factors like central nervous system function [62].\nHallucinogens, drugs, or alcohol might be factors [62].\nSignificant life changes or illness could be non-physical [62].\nAsk about a history of behavioral health illness [62].\nIn geriatric patients, consider Alzheimer's and dementia [63].\nIdentify the patient's baseline mental status [64].\nUse reflective listening to understand the patient's thinking [65].\nReflective listening involves repeating what the patient tells you [176].\n5. Management and Intervention Strategies\nDe-escalation Techniques\nEstablish a level of trust [17]\nBe a good listener [79]\nUse verbal de-escalation before physical restraint [115]\nCommunication is the key in behavioral health emergencies [16].\nIn some cases, patients will de-escalate [17].\nThis happens when a level of trust is established [17].\nYou cannot determine the cause of the crisis [17].\nHowever, you may predict potential for violence [17].\nThe best treatment may be to be a good listener [79].\nIntervene only as much as needed to accomplish tasks [79].\nIf pharmacological restraint might be necessary, request advanced life\nsupport early [79].\nDiffuse and control the situation [78].\n6. Specific Behavioral Health Conditions\nPsychosis is a state of delusion [83].\nThe person is out of touch with reality [83].\nAffected people live in their own reality [83].\nCauses of psychotic episodes include altered mind-altering substances [83].\nIntense stress or delusional disorders can cause psychosis [83].\nschizophrenia is also a cause of psychosis [83].\nschizophrenia is a complex disorder [84].\nIt is not easily defined or treated [84].\nOnset typically occurs during early adulthood [85].\nSymptoms become more prominent over time [85].\nContributing influences include brain damage and genetics [86].\nPhysiologic and social influences also contribute [86].\nSymptoms are delusions, hallucinations, and lack of pleasure [87].\nErratic speech is also a symptom [87].\nWhen dealing with schizophrenia, determine if the situation is safe [87].\nClearly identify yourself [88].\nBe calm, direct, and straightforward [88].\nMaintain an emotional distance [88].\nDo not argue with the patient [89].\nExplain what you are going to do [89].\nInvolve people the patient trusts, like family [89].\nThis helps gain the patient's cooperation [89].\nexcited delirium is also known as agitated delirium [90].\nIt can also be called exhaustive mania [90].\nDelirium is an impairment in cognitive function [91].\nIt can present with disorientation, hallucinations, or delusions [91].\nAgitation is characterized by restlessness [92].\nIrregular physical activity is a sign of agitation [92].\nSymptoms of excited delirium include hyperactive, irrational behavior [93].\nVivid hallucinations are a symptom [93].\nHypertension, tachycardia, and diaphoresis can occur [93].\nDilated pupils are also a symptom [93].\nIf safe to approach, be calm, supportive, and empathetic [94].\nApproach the patient slowly and purposefully [95].\nRespect the patient's personal space [95].\nLimit physical contact as much as possible [96].\nDo not leave the patient unattended [96].\nUse careful interviewing to assess cognitive functioning [97].\nDetermine the patient's ability to communicate [98].\nObserve the patient's appearance, dress, and hygiene [99].\nIf overdose is suspected, take medicine bottles with you [100].\nTransport to a hospital with a behavioral health facility [101].\nRefrain from using lights and sirens [101].\nIf agitation continues, request advanced life support [102].\nchemical restraints can be considered [102].\nexcited delirium can lead to sudden death from cardiac arrest [103].\nThis is thought to result from metabolic acidosis [103].\nPhysical control measures include tasers and stimulant drugs [104].\npositional asphyxia is also a risk [104].\n7. Patient Restraints: Considerations and Procedures\nRisks of Improper Restraint\nPositional asphyxia [111]\nAspiration [111]\nSevere acidosis [111]\nCardiac arrest [111]\nPre-hospital patient restraints reduce injury possibility [104].\nThis protects the patient and EMS providers [104].\nRestraints allow for safe treatment of uncooperative patients [105].\nA pre-hospital patient restraint protocol should be followed [106].\nThe protocol should address appropriateness and types of restraint [107].\nCare provided after restraint should be in the protocol [107].\nProtocols must consider state laws [108].\nOnly approved restraint devices should be used [109].\nThe least restrictive method ensuring safety should be chosen [110].\nThere are risks associated with restraints [111].\nImproper use can lead to life-threatening conditions [111].\nThese include positional asphyxia, aspiration, and severe acidosis [111].\nCardiac arrest is also a possibility [111].\nRestraining without authority can result in legal actions [112].\nExamples are assault, battery, or false imprisonment [112].\nViolation of civil rights is also a risk [112].\nRestraints are only to protect yourself and others from bodily harm [113].\nThey prevent the patient from injuring themselves [113].\nInvolve law enforcement for severe behavioral crises [114].\nUse verbal de-escalation before physical restraint [115].\nOnce the decision to restrain is made, do it quickly [116].\nIdeally, five people should be present for restraint [117].\nOne person for each extremity and one for the head is ideal [118].\nA team leader should direct the process [119].\nUse the minimum force necessary [119].\nForce level depends on factors like patient size and strength [121].\nThe type of abnormal behavior also affects force needed [122].\nTalk to the patient throughout the process [123].\nTreat the patient with dignity and respect [124].\nA provider of the same gender should tend the patient if possible [124].\nWear appropriate barrier protection [125].\nAvoid direct eye contact until necessary [125].\nRespect the patient's personal space [125].\nNever leave a restrained patient unattended [126].\nfour-point restraints are preferred for uncooperative patients [126].\nThis means both arms and legs are restrained [126].\nRespiratory and circulatory problems can occur in restrained patients [127].\nRestraints should not be removed until evaluated at the hospital [128].\nFollow skill drills for four-point restraint [129].\ntwo-point restraint is an option if allowed by protocol [130].\nReassess and document respiration, pulse, motor, and sensory functions [77].\nDo this every five minutes in restrained extremities [77].\n8. Assessing Potential for Violence and Suicide Risk\nViolent patients are a small percentage of behavioral crises [131].\nAssess the danger level based on risk factors [132].\nHistory is a risk factor for violence [132].\nHas the patient been hostile or violent before? [132].\nPosture can indicate danger [132].\nIs the patient tense, rigid, or sitting on edge? [132].\nThe scene provides clues [132].\nIs the patient near potentially lethal objects like a knife or gun? [132].\nVocal activity is a factor [132].\nIs speech loud, obscene, erratic, or bizarre? [132].\nErratic speech patterns usually indicate emotional distress [132].\nPhysical activity may be the most telling factor [132].\nA patient requiring watching has tense muscles or clenched fists [133].\nPacing or inability to sit still are signs [133].\nFiercely protecting personal space is a sign [133].\nPoor muscle impulse control is a risk factor [133].\nA history of fighting or uncontrollable temper is a risk [134].\nSubstance abuse history increases risk [134].\nDepression accounts for 20 percent of violent acts [134].\nA functional disorder can increase risk [134].\nIf a patient hears voices telling them to kill, believe them [135].\nDepression is the most significant factor contributing to suicide [136].\nIt's a misconception that those who threaten suicide won't commit it [137].\nThreatening suicide means someone is in crisis [138].\nThey cannot handle it alone [138].\nImmediate intervention is necessary for suicidal patients [138].\nWarning signs include sadness, despair, and hopelessness [139].\nAppearing detached is a sign [139].\nInability to talk about the future is a sign [139].\nSuggestions of suicide are warning signs [139].\nSpecific plans for suicide or death are major warnings [139].\nAdditional risk factors for suicide include unsafe objects nearby [141].\nAn unsafe environment is a risk [141].\nEvidence of self-destructive behavior is a risk [141].\nAn immediate threat to the patient or others is a risk [141].\nAn underlying medical problem can increase risk [141].\nCultural, religious, and social beliefs promoting suicide are risks [141].\nTrauma can increase suicide risk [141].\nA suicidal patient may also be homicidal [141].\n9. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) in Combat Veterans\nSigns and Symptoms of PTSD\nHelplessness [148]\nAnxiety, anger, or fear [148]\nAvoiding reminders of the trauma [148]\nConstant nervous system arousal [148]\nIncreased heart rate [149]\nDilated pupils [149]\nIncreased systolic blood pressure [149]\nSharpened senses [150]\nHeightened mental acuity [150]\nReliving trauma through thoughts, nightmares, or flashbacks [151]\nAlcohol and drug use [152]\nIncreased risk of suicide [153]\nPhysical conditions related to injuries [153]\nUnfocused pain [153]\nHigher incidence of TBI [154]\nPTSD can occur after trauma exposure or injury [143].\nExamples include sexual or physical assault [144].\nChild abuse or serious accidents are also causes [144].\nNatural disasters, war, or loss of a loved one can cause PTSD [144].\nA stressful life event can lead to PTSD [144].\nPTSD is not always from a single recent event [145].\nEstimated 7-8% of the general population experience PTSD [146].\nMilitary personnel in combat have a high incidence of PTSD [147].\nSigns include helplessness, anxiety, anger, or fear [148].\nThey frequently avoid trauma reminders [148].\nThey suffer constant nervous system arousal [148].\nHeart rate and systolic blood pressure increase [149].\nPupils dilate [149].\nSenses are sharpened and mental acuity heightened [150].\nThey often relive the trauma through flashbacks [151].\nPTSD occurs when trying to escape internal distress [152].\nAlcohol and drug use are common among veterans [152].\nVeterans have an increased risk of suicide [153].\nThey may develop physical conditions related to combat injuries [153].\nUnfocused pain not tied to a body part is possible [153].\nCombat veterans have a higher incidence of TBI [154].\nTBI is often from IED explosions [154].\nEliminate excess noise when caring for veterans [155].\nRefrain from touching or doing anything without explanation [155].\nKeep diesel equipment far away if possible [155].\nReturning vets require understanding and compassion [156].\nThey need specialized attention [156].\nBe careful how you phrase questions [157].\nUse a calm tone but be in charge [157].\nRespect a veteran's personal space [157].\nLimit the number of people involved [157].\nMove to a private and quiet space if possible [157].\nAsk about suicidal intentions [157].\nMilitary personnel are trained with weapons [158].\nThey are resourceful in improvising weapons [158].\nEnsure no accessible objects can be used as weapons [159].\nPhysical restraint is ineffective with this population [160].\nIt may simply escalate the problem [160].\n10. Medical-Legal Considerations\nMedical-legal aspects are complicated in behavioral emergencies [161].\nIf a patient has impaired mental capacity, decide if they need emergency care\n[162].\nA mentally unstable patient may resist care [163].\nDo not leave this patient alone [163].\nRequest law enforcement to handle the patient [164].\nYou need consent to provide care [165].\nimplied consent is assumed if the patient is not mentally competent [165].\nConsent matters are not always clear-cut [165].\nIf unsure, request law enforcement assistance [166].\nGuidance from medical control is also helpful [166].\nEMTs have limited legal authority to force care [167].\nThis is true when no life-threatening emergency exists [167].\nA competent adult can refuse treatment [168].\nThis is true even if life-saving care is involved [168].\nIn psychiatric cases, providing life-saving care is likely considered appropriate\n[169].\nAn impaired patient may not be competent to refuse treatment [170].\nAlways maintain a high index of suspicion [171].\nAssume the worst and hope for the best [171].\nError on the side of treatment and transport [171].\nCarefully document patient statements and behaviors [171].\nThis supports your actions [171].",
