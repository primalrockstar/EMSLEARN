Introduction to Lifespan Development in Emergency Care\nWelcome to chapter 7 on lifespan development [1].\nUnderstanding physiological and psychosocial differences is fundamental [2].\nThis chapter covers each phase of human development [2].\nEMTs must be aware of physical changes across stages [5].\nThese changes alter the approach to patient care [5].\nDiscuss adaptations and strategies for patient assessment [3].\nThese strategies can improve patient management [3].\n2. Neonates and Infants (Birth to 1 Year)\nneonates are from birth to one month [6].\ninfants are from one month to a year [6].\nThey develop at a startling rate [6].\nneonates weigh six to eight pounds at birth [7].\nThe head is 25% of their body weight [8].\ninfants grow about one ounce per day after week two [9].\nThey double their weight by four to six months [9].\nWeight triples by the end of the first year [9].\nAt birth, neonates transition to independent circulation [10].\nPrior to birth, lungs have never been inflated [11].\nThe first breath is facilitated by chest passage [11].\nThis increases inner thoracic pressure [11].\ninfants younger than six months are prone to nasal congestion [12].\ninfants have proportionately larger tongues [13].\nThey have proportionately shorter, narrow airways [13].\nAirway obstructions are more common in infants [13].\nThe rib cage is less rigid [13].\nRibs sit horizontally for bag valve mask ventilation [13].\ninfant lungs are very fragile [14].\nForceful ventilations can result in trauma from pressure [14].\nThis is called barotrauma [14].\nRespiratory muscles are immature [15].\nThere are fewer alveoli in the lungs [15].\nRespiratory problems can quickly become life-threatening [15].\nThe nervous system evolves after birth [16].\nneonates are born with certain reflexes [16].\nmoro reflex is a startle reflex [16].\nThey open arms wide and spread fingers [16].\nThey seem to grab at things [16].\npalmer grasp occurs when an object is placed in palms [17].\nrooting reflex: turns head towards touch on cheek [18].\nsucking reflex occurs when lips are stroked [19].\nfontanelles are spaces between skull bones [19].\nThe posterior fontanelle fuses at about three months [20].\nThe anterior fontanelle fuses at nine to 18 months [20].\nA depressed fontanelle may indicate dehydration [21].\nA bulging fontanelle indicates increased intracranial pressure [21].\nBy two months, infants track objects with eyes [24].\nThey can recognize familiar faces [24].\nAt six months, they can sit upright [25].\nThey begin making cooing and babbling sounds [25].\nBy 12 months, infants can walk with minimal assistance [26].\nThey know their name [26].\nThe immune system maintains some mother's immunities [27].\ninfants receive antibodies via breast milk [28].\nBreast milk fosters further immune system boosters [28].\nPsychosocial changes begin at birth [29].\nChanges evolve as the infant interacts with the environment [29].\nCrying is the main method of communicating distress [30].\nBonding is based on a secure attachment [30].\nanxious avoidant attachment is seen in repeatedly rejected infants [30].\nThese children show little emotional response to caregivers [31].\nThey treat caregivers as strangers [31].\nseparation anxiety is common in older infants [32].\nTrust and mistrust is a stage from birth to 18 months [33].\nThis involves infant's needs being met by caregivers [33].\nCharacteristic Description Source\nWeight Birth: 6-8 lbs; Doubles by 4-6 mos; Triples by 1 yr\n[7]\nHead Size 25% of body weight at birth\n[8]\nCardiovascular Transition from fetal to independent circulation at\nbirth\n[10]\nPulmonary Fragile lungs, less rigid rib cage, immature\nmuscles, fewer alveoli\n[14]\nNervous\nSystem\nBorn with Moro, Palmer grasp, Rooting, Sucking\nreflexes; Fontanelles fuse over time\n[16]\nImmune System Maintains mother's immunities; Receives\nantibodies via breast milk\n[27]\nCommunication Crying is main method\n[30]\nAttachment Secure attachment is key; Anxious avoidant\nattachment from rejection\n[30]\nTrust Developed from needs being met by caregivers\n(birth to 18 mos)\n[33]\n3. Toddlers and Preschoolers (1 to 6 Years)\nToddlers are about one to three years old [35].\nPreschoolers are three to six years old [35].\nCardiovascular system is not dramatically different from adults [35].\nPulse rate is 80 to 140 beats per minute [36].\nRespiratory rate is 20 to 25 breaths per minute [36].\nSystolic blood pressure is 80 to 100 mmHg [36].\nLung musculature is not well-developed [37].\nThey cannot sustain deep or rapid respirations long [37].\nWeight gain should level off [38].\nLoss of passive immunity is impactful [38].\nNeuromuscular growth makes considerable progress [39].\nToilet training is usually completed around 28 months [39].\nThe psychosocial challenge is autonomy versus shame and doubt [40].\nBasic language is mastered around 36 months [41].\nInteraction and playing games with others begins [41].\nCause and effect starts to be understood by 18 to 24 months [41].\nChildren recognize gender differences by observing role models [42].\n4. School-Age Children (6 to 12 Years)\nSchool-aged children are from 6 to 12 years [43].\nPhysical traits and functions mature rapidly [44].\nThey grow four pounds each year [45].\nThey grow two to five inches each year [45].\nPermanent teeth come in [45].\nBrain activity increases in both hemispheres [45].\nChildren learn various types of reasoning [46].\nThree types of reasoning exist [46].\npre-conventional reasoning: acting to avoid punishment and get wants [47].\nconventional reasoning: looking for approval from peers and society [48].\nPost-conventional reasoning: making decisions guided by consequences\n[48].\nChildren begin developing self-concept at this age [48].\nThey also develop self-esteem [48].\nType of\nReasoning\nDescription Source\nPre-conventional Actions based on avoiding punishment and\ngetting desires\n[47]\nConventional Seeking approval from peers and society\n[48]\nPostconventional\nDecisions guided by consequences\n[48]\n5. Adolescents (12 to 18 Years)\nAdolescents are from 12 to 18 years [50].\nVital signs level off within adult ranges [51].\nPulse rate is 60 to 100 beats per minute [51].\nRespiratory rate is 12 to 20 breaths per minute [52].\nSystolic blood pressure is 90 to 110 mmHg [52].\nAdolescents experience a two to three year growth spurt [53].\nMuscle and bone growth increases [53].\nGirls generally finish their growth spurt around 16 [54].\nBoys generally finish their growth spurt around 18 [54].\nThe endocrine and reproductive system matures [55].\nSecondary sexual development takes place [55].\nPubic and axillary hair appear [55].\nVoices start to change [55].\nMenstruation begins [55].\nConflict with parents often occurs as adolescents gain control [56].\nPrivacy becomes an issue [56].\nSelf-consciousness increases [56].\nThey may struggle to create their own identity [57].\nMultiple options for gender exist [57].\nMany are fixated on their public image [58].\nThey often want to be treated like adults [58].\nYet, they want to be cared for like younger children [58].\nAnti-social behavior and peer pressure peak at 14 to 16 [59].\nSmoking, illicit drug use, and unprotected sex may arise [59].\nEating disorders can arise from attempts to gain self-control [59].\nA code of personal ethics develops [60].\nEthics are based on parents' values, peers, and experience [60].\nAdolescents have a high risk for suicide [61].\nThey also have a high risk for depression [61].\n6. Early Adults (19 to 40 Years)\nEarly adults are from 19 to 40 years [62].\nVital signs do not vary from those in adulthood [62].\nPulse rate averages around 70 beats per minute [62].\nThe range is 60 to 100 beats per minute [62].\nRespiratory rate stays in the range of 12 to 20 [63].\nSystolic blood pressure is between 90 to 120 mmHg [63].\nFrom 19 to shortly after 23, the body functions optimally [64].\nLifelong habits are solidified [65].\nThe body is working at peak efficiency [65].\nIn latter years of early adulthood, aging effects become evident [65].\nLife centers on work, family, and stress [65].\nAdults strive to create a place for themselves [65].\nMany do everything to settle down [65].\nDespite stress and change, this is a stable period [65].\n7. Middle Adults (41 to 60 Years)\nMiddle adults are between 41 to 60 years [66].\nVital signs remain about the same [66].\nMiddle adults are vulnerable to vision loss [67].\nThey are also vulnerable to hearing loss [67].\nCardiovascular health becomes an issue [67].\nThe incidence of cancer increases [67].\nmenopause takes place in the late 40s and early 50s [67].\nDiabetes is common [68].\nHypertension is common [68].\nWeight problems are common [68].\nExercise and a healthy diet can diminish aging effects [69].\nThere is a focus on achieving life's goals [69].\nMiddle adults readjust lifestyle as children leave home [70].\nFinances can become a worrisome issue [70].\nGenerally, people have physical, emotional, spiritual reserves [70].\nThese reserves help handle life's issues [70].\nThey may care for children leaving for college [71].\nThey may also care for their aging parents [71].\nCommon Health Issues Source\nVision Loss\n[67]\nHearing Loss\n[67]\nCardiovascular Problems\n[67]\nCancer (increased incidence)\n[67]\nDiabetes\n[68]\nHypertension\n[68]\nWeight Problems\n[68]\n8. Older Adults (61 Years and Up)\nOlder adults include ages 61 years and up [72].\nLife expectancy is constantly changing [73].\nCurrently, it is about 78 years old [73].\nLife expectancy is determined by birth year and country [73].\nThey often overcome numerous medical conditions [74].\nThey may need multiple medications [74].\nCardiac function declines with age [75].\nThis is largely due to atherosclerosis [75].\nHeart rate and cardiac output decrease [75].\nCardiac output may not meet body demands [76].\nThe vascular system becomes stiff [76].\nThe heart works harder to overcome vascular resistance [77].\nAbility to provide replacement blood cells declines [77].\nBlood volume also declines [77].\nThe size of airways may decrease or increase [78].\nSurface area of alveoli decreases [78].\nElasticity and strength of intercostal muscles and diaphragm decrease [78].\nBreathing becomes more labor intensive [78].\nBy age 75, vital capacity may be 50% of a young adult [79].\nThe chest becomes more rigid and fragile [80].\nCough and gag reflexes diminish [80].\nAbility to clear secretions diminishes [80].\nOlder adults are at greater risk of aspiration [80].\nThey are also at greater risk of airway obstruction [80].\nSmooth muscles of the lower airway weaken [81].\nThis causes airway collapse on inhalation [81].\nThis produces inspiratory wheezing [82].\nLower flow rates and air trapping in alveoli occur [82].\nOlder adults are more susceptible to lung infections [83].\nInsulin production drops off [84].\nMetabolism decreases [84].\nReproductive system changes occur [85].\nHormone production for both sexes decreases gradually [86].\nSexual desire may diminish but does not cease [86].\nChanges occur in gastric and intestinal function [87].\nThis may inhibit natural intake and utilization [87].\nTooth loss may make chewing difficult [87].\nTaste and sensations decrease [87].\nSaliva secretion decreases [87].\nThis reduces ability to produce complex carbohydrates [87].\nIntestines' ability to contract and move food diminishes [88].\nGastric acid secretion diminishes [88].\nGallstones become increasingly common [88].\nDecreased elasticity of anal sphincter causes fecal incontinence [88].\nRenal filtration function declines by 50% from 20 to 90 [89].\nKidney mass decreases 20% over the same span [90].\nBlood supply reduction occurs in the kidneys [90].\nAbility to remove waste decreases [91].\nAbility to conserve fluids decreases when needed [91].\nBrain weight may shrink 10 to 20% by age 80 [92].\nMotor and sensory neural networks become slower [93].\nNeurons are lost [94].\nThis does not mean loss of knowledge or skill [94].\nSleep patterns change [94].\nAge-related shrinkage creates a void between brain and meninges [95].\nThis void provides room for the brain to move when stressed [95].\nPeripheral nerves slow with age [96].\nSensations become diminished and may be misinterpreted [96].\nIncreased reaction time causes longer delays between stimulation and motion\n[97].\nProlonged reaction times and slower reflexes contribute to falls [97].\nPupillary reaction and ocular movements become restricted [98].\nVisual distortions are common [98].\nPeripheral fields of vision narrow [98].\nHearing loss is four times more common than vision loss [98].\nLoss of high frequency hearing or deafness occurs [98].\nMost people retain high brain function until about five years before death [99].\n95% of the elderly live at home [100].\nThey may need assistance from family, friends, or home health care [100].\nIncreased need exists for assisted living facilities [100].\nFinancial limits may restrict healthcare access or medications [100].\nOver 50% of single women 60 or older live at or below poverty [101].\nFacing their own mortality is an important issue [102].\nIsolation and depression are also issues [102].\nThese changes can be challenges [103].\nSystem Changes Source\nCardiovascular Declining function, atherosclerosis, decreased\ncardiac output, stiff vascular system, reduced\nblood volume\n[75]\nRespiratory Airway size changes, decreased alveoli surface\narea, reduced muscle elasticity, more labor\nintensive breathing, reduced vital capacity, rigid\nchest, diminished reflexes\n[78]\nEndocrine Decreased insulin production, decreased\nmetabolism\n[84]\nReproductive Gradual decrease in hormone production, sexual\ndesire may diminish\n[86]\nDigestive Changes in function, inhibited intake/utilization,\ntooth loss, decreased taste/sensations, reduced\nsaliva, decreased intestinal contraction, diminished\n[87]\ngastric acid, common gallstones, fecal\nincontinence\nRenal 50% filtration function decline (20-90), 20% kidney\nmass decrease, reduced blood supply, decreased\nability to remove waste/conserve fluids\n[89]\nNervous Brain weight shrinks, slower neural networks,\nneuron loss, altered sleep patterns, void between\nbrain/meninges, slowed peripheral nerves,\ndiminished/misinterpreted sensations, increased\nreaction time, slower reflexes\n[92]\nSensory Restricted pupillary/ocular movements, visual\ndistortions, narrowed peripheral vision, hearing loss\n(especially high frequency)\n[98]\n9. Conclusion and Review\nReview questions test understanding of chapter concepts [105].\nBag valve mask ventilation in infants requires remembering lungs are\nfragile [106].\nAn infant reaching out and drooling is likely four months old [107].\nA repeatedly rejected infant experiences anxious avoidant attachment [108]\n.\nColds develop easily in toddlers/preschoolers due to loss of passive\nimmunity, less developed lung musculature, and time around playmates\n[109].\nThe pulse rate of a toddler is slightly higher than adults at 90 to 150 bpm\n[111].\nA school-aged child seeking peer/society approval shows conventional\nreasoning [112].\nself-concept is how we perceive ourselves [114].\nBe concerned about a depressed 16-year-old because adolescents have a\nhigher suicide rate [114].\nFinances become an issue in middle adulthood due to supporting children\nand aging parents [115].\nBreathing is more labor-intensive for the elderly due to decreased\nintercostal muscle/diaphragm strength, decreased alveoli surface area,\nand reduced elasticity of lung tissue [117].\nThis concludes chapter seven on lifespan development [119].",
