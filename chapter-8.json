Types of Patient Moves\nemergency moves are used when there is immediate danger before full\nassessment or care [84].\nExamples include a scene that is unsafe or the patient's position prevents\nimmediate care [84].\nTechniques aim to prevent aggravation of potential spinal cord injury [85].\nCommon emergency move techniques include the clothes drag [86].\nThe blanket drag involves placing the patient on a blanket to be pulled [87].\nThe arm drag involves grasping the patient's wrists with arms extended above\ntheir head [88].\nThe arm-to-arm drag involves grasping opposite wrists through the patient's\narmpits [88].\nRemoving an unconscious patient from a vehicle alone requires specific steps\n[89].\nurgent moves are necessary for patients with conditions like altered level of\nconsciousness, inadequate ventilation, shock, or in extreme weather [92].\nThe rapid extrication technique is an urgent move for patients in a vehicle\n[93].\nThis technique is used when urgency exists and the patient must be moved\nquickly [93].\nIt can move a patient from a vehicle to a backboard in about a minute [95].\nHowever, this technique increases the risk of spinal cord injury [95].\nConsider all options before using rapid extrication [95].\nNon-urgent moves are used when the scene and patient are stable [97].\nThese moves should be carefully planned [97].\nThe direct ground lift is for patients found on the ground with no suspected\nspinal injury [98].\nIt is used when the patient needs to be carried a distance to the stretcher [99].\nTwo EMTs stand side by side to lift and carry the patient [99].\nThe extremity lift is for patients with no suspected extremity or spinal cord\ninjury [100].\nIt is useful in small spaces as it doesn't require standing side by side [101].\nOne EMT is at the head, the other at the feet [102].\nMovements are coordinated with direct verbal commands [102].\nTransfer moves include the direct carry and draw sheet method [103].\nA direct carry moves a supine patient from a bed to a stretcher with two or\nmore rescuers [103].\nThe draw sheet method uses a sheet or blanket to move a patient from bed to\nstretcher [104].\nUsing a scoop stretcher is another transfer method [104].\nOther carries include the log roll or slide to move a patient to a backboard [105]\n.\nChecking airway, breathing, and circulation is the first step if a patient is not in\nimmediate danger [168].\n4. Special Considerations and Patient Positioning\nPatient Condition Recommended Position Notes\nNo suspected injury,\nchest pain/respiratory\ndistress [138]\nPosition of comfort\n(typically Fowler or semi-\nFowler) [138]\nShock [139] Supine position [139]\nLate stages of\npregnancy [140]\nTransport on their left\nside [140]\nPosition on left side if\nuncomfortable or hypotensive\nin supine position [141]\nUnresponsive, no\nsuspected injury, hip,\nor pelvic injury [142]\nRecovery position [142]\nNauseated or\nvomiting [142]\nPosition of comfort [142]\nSuspected spinal cord\ninjury [106]\nConsider geriatricspecific\nimmobilization\ndevices like vacuum\nmattresses [107]\nSkeletal changes in older\nadults may prevent lying\nsupine on backboards/scoop\nstretchers [106]\nMost patients transported by EMS are geriatric patients [106].\nSkeletal changes in older people can lead to brittle bones, rigidity, or spinal\ncurvatures [107].\nThese changes can make lying supine on a backboard or scoop stretcher\ndifficult or injurious [107].\nConsider using geriatric-specific mobilization devices such as vacuum\nmattresses [107].\nBariatric patients (overweight or obese) present unique challenges [108].\nMoving bariatric patients takes an increasing toll on EMT health [108].\nBack injuries are a major cause of missed workdays for EMTs [109].\nEquipment with higher capacity is being developed, but user danger remains\n[109].\nSpecial bariatric techniques, equipment, and resources are needed for\npatients over 350 pounds [63].\nExamples of bariatric equipment include specialized stretchers [112].\nMnemonic or electric-powered stretchers limit the risk of injury [114].\nPatients must be properly positioned based on their chief complaint [137].\nPatients with chest pain or respiratory distress and no suspected injury\nshould be placed in a position of comfort, usually Fowler or semi-Fowler [138].\nPatients in shock should be placed in the supine position [139].\nLate-stage pregnant patients should be transported on their left side [140].\nThe left-side position is especially important if they are uncomfortable or\nhypotensive in the supine position [141].\nAn unresponsive patient without suspected injury should be placed in the\nrecovery position [142].\nPatients who are nauseated or vomiting should be transported in a position of\ncomfort [142].\nBefore using medical restraints, evaluate for correctable causes of\ncombativeness like head injury or hypoxia [143].\nFollow local protocols and obtain medical authorization for restraints [143].\nRestraining a patient typically requires a minimum of five people: one for each\nextremity and one for the head [144].\nOne EMT should be the team leader [145].\nThe patient should be in the supine position [146].\nA prone position can lead to asphyxia [146].\nApply a restraint to each extremity [147].\nRestrain the patient to a backboard with one arm above the head and the\nother by the side [148].\nAssess the patient's ABCs, mental status, and circulation after applying\nrestraints [149].\nDocument all restraint information [149].\n5. Team Coordination and Safety\nTeam actions must be coordinated when moving patients [82].\nA team leader indicates team member positions and describes the steps\nbefore lifting [82].\nThe team leader uses preparatory commands and countdowns [84].\nCarefully plan ahead by selecting methods with the least amount of lifting and\ncarrying [84].\nConsider potential sources of strain during the move [84].\nPerform a personal safety assessment before moving a patient [150].\nAsk yourself if you are physically strong enough [151].\nAssess if there is adequate room for a proper stance [151].\nDetermine if additional personnel are needed for assistance [151].\nInjured EMTs cannot provide help [151].\nEquipment decontamination is essential after use [135].\ndecontamination protects the safety of yourself, the crew, and future patients\n[135].\nIt also prevents the spread of disease [135].\nKnow and follow local standard operating procedures for disinfecting\nequipment [136].",
