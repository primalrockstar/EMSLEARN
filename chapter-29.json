Introduction to Head and Spine Injuries\nThis chapter focuses on head and spine injuries [1].\nUnderstanding this material helps manage trauma-related issues [2].\nIt is crucial to recognize life threats from these injuries [3].\nImmediate spinal stabilization is essential [3].\nAirway and breathing support may also be needed [3].\n2. Anatomy and Physiology of the Nervous System\nSystem Components Protection Functions\nCentral\nNervous\nBrain, Spinal cord [16] Skull, Bony\nspinal canal\n[11], Meninges\nControls body, Center of\nconsciousness, Carries\nmessages between\nbrain and body [17]\nPeripheral 31 pairs of spinal\nnerves, 12 pairs of\ncranial nerves, Sensory\nnerves, Motor nerves,\nConnecting nerves [36]\nNone\nspecified\nConducts impulses,\nTransports information\ndirectly to/from brain,\nPerforms special\nfunctions [37]\nThe nervous system is a complex network of nerve cells [9].\nIt includes the brain, spinal cord, nerve fibers, and nerves [10].\nThe nervous system is well protected by bony structures [11].\nSerious injuries can damage the nervous system despite this protection [12].\nThe central nervous system includes the brain and spinal cord [16].\nThe brain controls the body [17].\nIt is the center of consciousness [17].\nThe brain is divided into three major areas: cerebrum, cerebellum, and\nbrainstem [18].\nThe cerebrum controls voluntary motor function and conscious\nthought [20].\nThe cerebellum coordinates balance and body movements [22].\nThe brain stem controls most functions necessary for life [23].\nThis includes cardiac and respiratory systems [23].\nIt is the best protected part of the central nervous system [24].\nThe spinal cord carries messages between the brain and body [25].\nThe central nervous system is protected by the meninges [27].\nThese are three layers of tissues [27].\nThe outer layer, dura mater, is a tough, fibrous sac [28].\nThe inner two layers, arachnoid mater and pia mater, contain blood\nvessels [29].\nCerebral spinal fluid (CSF) is produced inside the brain [31].\nIt is produced in the third ventricle [32].\nCSF acts primarily as a shock absorber [33].\nClear, watery CSF may leak from the nose, ears, or an open skull fracture if\nprotective layers are penetrated [34].\nThe peripheral nervous system has spinal nerves and cranial nerves [36].\nSpinal nerves conduct impulses to and from the spinal cord [37].\nCranial nerves transport information directly to or from the brain [40].\nCranial nerves perform special functions in the head and face [41].\nThere are two types of peripheral nerves: sensory and motor [42].\nSensory nerves carry information from the body to the brain [44].\nMotor nerves carry information from the central nervous system to the\nmuscles [45].\nConnecting nerves are found in the brain and spinal cord [46].\nThey connect sensory and motor nerves [46].\nThe nervous system controls reflex activities, voluntary activities, and\ninvoluntary activities [48].\nA reflex arc in the spinal cord allows simple messages to bypass the brain\n[49].\nThe somatic nervous system handles voluntary activities [52].\nThe autonomic nervous system handles involuntary functions [53].\nThe autonomic system is divided into sympathetic and parasympathetic\ndivisions [54].\nThe sympathetic system reacts to stress with the fight or flight response\n[56].\nThe parasympathetic system has opposite effects, such as slowing heart\nrate [57].\nThese divisions balance each other for homeostasis [58].\n3. Skeletal Structures Protecting the Nervous System\nThe skeletal system includes the skull and the spinal cord [61].\nThe skull is composed of cranial and facial bones [61].\nThe brain connects to the spinal cord through the foramen magnum [62].\nFour major bones make up the cranium: occipital, temporal, parietal, and\nfrontal [63].\nThe face is composed of 14 bones, including the maxilla, zygoma,\nmandible, nasal, and frontal [64].\nThe spinal cord is the body's central supporting structure [66].\nIt has 33 vertebrae [67].\nThese are divided into five sections: cervical, thoracic, lumbar, sacral, and\ncoccygeal [68].\nThe front part of each vertebrae is the vertebral body [70].\nThe back forms a bony arch [70].\nThe series of arches forms the spinal canal [71].\nThe spinal canal protects the spinal cord [71].\nVertebrae are connected by ligaments and separated by intervertebral\ndiscs [72].\n4. Head Injuries: Types, Mechanisms, and Signs\nAspect Description\nDefinition Traumatic insult to the head [74]\nImpact May injure soft tissue, bony structures, or the brain [74] accounts\nfor over half of traumatic deaths [75]\nTypes Closed head injury, Open head injury [78]\nMechanisms Falls, Motor vehicle crashes, Assaults, Sports related incidents [81]\nGeneral\nSigns\nVarious signs listed in a table [83]\nA head injury is a traumatic insult to the head [74].\nIt can injure soft tissue, bony structures, or the brain [74].\nHead injuries account for over half of all traumatic deaths [75].\nFatal injuries always involve the brain [76].\nBe aware of additional trauma the patient may have [77].\nThere are generally two types of head injuries: closed and open [78].\nIn closed head injuries, the brain is injured, but there is no opening [79].\nAn open head injury has an opening to the outside world [80].\nThis is often caused by penetrating trauma [80].\nBrain tissue may be exposed [80].\nCommon mechanisms of injury include falls and motor vehicle crashes [81].\nOther mechanisms include assaults and sports incidents [82].\nGeneral signs and symptoms are shown in a table [83].\n5. Specific Types of Head Injuries\nInjury Type Description Key Characteristics / Signs\nScalp\nLacerations\nMinor or serious cuts\nto the scalp [84]\nCan lead to significant blood loss,\nespecially in children [84] May contribute to\nhypovolemia in multiple injuries [85]\nSkull\nFractures\nBreak in the skull\nbone [86]\nMay be open or closed [87] Result from\nsignificant force [86]\nLinear Skull\nFracture\nAccounts for 80% of\nskull fractures [90]\nOften no physical signs [91] Diagnosed with\nradiographs [91]\nDepressed\nSkull Fracture\nHigh-energy direct\ntrauma [92]\nBony fragments may injure the brain [93]\nPatients may have neurologic injury signs,\nlike loss of consciousness [94] Most\nsusceptible areas are frontal and parietal\nbones [93]\nBasilar Skull\nFracture\nAssociated with\nhigh-energy diffuse\nimpact [95]\nExtension of linear fractures to the base of\nthe skull [96] Signs include CSF draining\nfrom ears, raccoon eyes, Battle signs [98]\nDiagnosed with CT [97]\nOpen Skull\nFracture\nOften associated\nwith trauma to\nmultiple systems [99]\nBrain tissue may be exposed [100] High risk\nof bacterial infection [100] Very high\nmortality rate [100]\nTraumatic\nBrain Injuries\n(TBI)\nTraumatic insult to\nthe brain [101]\nCan cause physical, intellectual, emotional,\nsocial, vocational changes [101] Classified\nas primary (direct) or secondary (indirect)\ninjury [101]\nPrimary Brain\nInjury\nDirect injury from the\nimpact [102]\nResult from the initial impact [102]\nSecondary\nBrain Injury\nIndirect injury that\nincreases primary\ninjury severity [102]\nCaused by cerebral edema, intracranial\nhemorrhage, increased ICP, cerebral\nischemia, or infection [102] Hypoxia and\nhypotension are common causes [103] Can\noccur minutes to days later [105] Result\nfrom blunt or penetrating trauma [106]\nCoup-\nContrecoup\nInjury\nInjury to front of\nbrain from initial\nimpact, then rear of\nbrain from head\nmovement [106]\nInitial impact injures front brain, head\nmovement injures rear brain [106]\nCerebral\nEdema\nSwelling of the brain\n[107]\nMay develop hours after injury [107] Low\nblood oxygen levels aggravate it [108]\nMonitor for seizure activity [109]\nScalp lacerations can be minor or serious [84].\nEven small cuts can cause significant blood loss [84].\nThis is especially true in children [84].\nBleeding can contribute to hypovolemia in patients with multiple injuries\n[85].\nSkull fractures can result from significant force [86].\nThey may be open or closed [87].\nPenetrating weapons frequently cause skull fractures [88].\nSigns include head deformity or a visible crack [88].\nRaccoon eyes (ecchymosis under the eyes) and Battle sign (ecchymosis\nbehind the ear) are signs of skull fracture [88].\nLinear skull fractures are the most common [90].\nThey account for about 80% of skull fractures [90].\nThey often have no physical signs [91].\nRadiographs are needed for diagnosis [91].\nDepressed skull fractures result from high-energy trauma with a blunt object\n[92].\nFrontal and parietal bones are most susceptible [93].\nBony fragments can be driven into the brain [93].\nPatients often show signs of neurologic injury [94].\nLoss of consciousness is a common sign [94].\nBasilar skull fractures are associated with high-energy trauma [95].\nThey usually follow diffuse impact to the head [95].\nThese are often extensions of linear fractures [96].\nSigns include CSF draining from the ears [98].\nRaccoon eyes or Battle signs may also be present [98].\nOpen skull fractures are often linked to trauma in multiple body systems [99].\nBrain tissue may be exposed [100].\nThis greatly increases the risk of bacterial infection [100].\nOpen skull fractures have a very high mortality rate [100].\nTraumatic brain injuries (TBIs) are defined as traumatic insults to the brain\n[101].\nThey can cause physical, intellectual, emotional, social, and vocational\nchanges [101].\nTBIs are classified into two categories: primary and secondary injury [101].\nPrimary injuries are the direct result of the impact [102].\nSecondary injuries increase the severity of the primary injury [102].\nCauses include cerebral edema and intracranial hemorrhage [102].\nIncreased intracranial pressure (ICP) and cerebral ischemia can also\ncause them [102].\nInfection is another possible cause [102].\nHypoxia and hypotension are the most common causes of secondary\nbrain injury [103].\nThey significantly increase death and disability [104].\nSecondary injuries can occur minutes to days after the initial injury [105].\nThey can result from blunt or penetrating trauma [106].\nA coup-contrecoup injury involves injury to both the front and rear of the\nbrain [106].\nCerebral edema (brain swelling) may develop hours after injury [107].\nLow blood oxygen levels make cerebral edema worse [108].\nMonitor the patient for seizure activity with any head injury [109].\n6. Intracranial Pressure and Hemorrhages\nCondition Description Signs and Symptoms Key Characteristics\nIncreased\nIntracranial\nPressure (ICP)\nAccumulation\nof blood or\nswelling within\nthe skull

[112]\nIntracranial\nHemorrhage\nBleeding\ninside the skull\n[113]\nUsually increases ICP\n[113]\nCan occur between\nskull/dura mater,\nbeneath dura\nmater/outside brain,\nor within brain\ntissues [114]\nEpidural\nHematoma\nBlood\naccumulation\nbetween skull\nand dura\nmater [115]\nNearly always results\nfrom a blow causing\nlinear fracture of\ntemporal bone [115]\nRapidly progressing\nsymptoms [115]\nImmediate loss of\nconsciousness [116]\nLucid interval [117] Lapse\nback into\nunconsciousness [117]\nFixed and dilated pupil\non hematoma side [118]\nUsually arterial\nbleeding (middle\nartery) [115] Death\nfollows rapidly\nwithout surgery [118]\nSubdural\nHematoma\nBlood\naccumulation\nbeneath dura\nmater, outside\nbrain [119]\nFluctuating level of\nconsciousness [122]\nSlurred speech [123]\nSigns develop more\ngradually [121] Needs\nphysician evaluation\n[123]\nUsually results from\nfalls or deceleration\nforces [120] More\ncommon than\nepidural hematomas\n[120] May or may not\nhave skull fracture\n[120] Associated with\nvenous bleed [121]\nIntracerebral\nHematoma\nBleeding\nwithin the\nbrain tissue\n[124]\nProgression of\nincreased ICP depends\non other injuries, brain\nregion, and size [126]\nHigh mortality rate [127]\nCan follow\npenetrating injury or\nrapid deceleration\n[124] Many small ones\nassociated with other\nbrain injuries [125]\nHigh mortality even\nwith surgery [127]\nSubarachnoid\nHemorrhage\nBleeding in the\nsubarachnoid\nspace where\nCSF circulates\n[127]\nBloody CSF [127] Signs\nof meningeal irritation\n(neck rigidity,\nheadache) [127] Sudden\nsevere headache [129]\nSigns of increased ICP\nas bleeding increases\n[130]\nOften occurs in\nsubarachnoid space\n[127] Causes include\ntrauma or aneurysm\nrupture [128] Sudden\nsevere cases usually\nresult in death [131]\nSurvivors often have\npermanent\nneurologic\nimpairment [132]\nAccumulation of blood or swelling within the skull can rapidly increase\nintracranial pressure (ICP) [109].\nIncreased ICP squeezes the brain against the skull [110].\nSigns of increased ICP include:\nAbnormal respiratory patterns (ataxic, Cheyne-Stokes) [111]\nDecreased pulse rate [111]\nHeadache, nausea, vomiting [111]\nDecreased alertness [111]\nBradycardia [112]\nSluggish or non-reactive pupils [112]\nCerebral posturing [112]\nIncreased or widened blood pressures [112]\nCushing's reflex is a triad of symptoms indicating increased ICP [112].\nIt consists of increased systolic blood pressure, decreased pulse rate,\nand irregular respirations [113].\nIntracranial hemorrhage is bleeding inside the skull [113].\nThis usually increases ICP [113].\nBleeding can occur in different locations: between the skull and dura\nmater, beneath the dura mater but outside the brain, or within the brain\ntissue itself [114].\nAn epidural hematoma is blood accumulation between the skull and dura\nmater [115].\nIt usually results from a blow to the head causing a linear fracture of the\ntemporal bone [115].\nIt is nearly always due to arterial bleeding [115].\nSymptoms progress rapidly [115].\nThe patient often loses consciousness immediately, followed by a brief\nlucid interval, then lapses back into unconsciousness [116].\nThe pupil on the side of the hematoma becomes fixed and dilated [118].\nDeath occurs rapidly without surgery [118].\nA subdural hematoma is blood accumulation beneath the dura mater, outside\nthe brain [119].\nIt usually happens after falls or injuries with strong deceleration forces [120]\n.\nIt is more common than epidural hematomas [120].\nIt may or may not be associated with a skull fracture [120].\nIt is linked to a venous bleed [121].\nSigns typically develop more gradually than with epidural hematomas [121].\nThe patient often has a fluctuating level of consciousness or slurred\nspeech [122].\nAn intracerebral hematoma involves bleeding within the brain itself [124].\nIt can occur after a penetrating head injury or rapid deceleration forces\n[124].\nMany small, deep hemorrhages are associated with other brain injuries\n[125].\nThe progression of increased ICP depends on other injuries, the brain\nregion, and the size of the hemorrhage [126].\nIntracerebral hematomas have a high mortality rate [127].\nThis is true even if the hematoma is surgically removed [127].\nA subarachnoid hemorrhage is bleeding in the subarachnoid space [127].\nThis is where CSF circulates [127].\nIt results in bloody CSF and signs of meningeal irritation [127].\nNeck rigidity or headache are signs of meningeal irritation [127].\nCommon causes include trauma or a ruptured aneurysm [128].\nPatients report a sudden severe headache [129].\nAs bleeding increases, signs of increased ICP appear [130].\nA sudden severe subarachnoid hemorrhage usually results in death [131].\nSurvivors often have permanent neurologic impairment [132].\n7. Concussions and Contusions\nA concussion is a blow to the head or face [133].\nIt is classified as a mild traumatic brain injury [133].\nIt is a closed injury [134].\nThere is temporary loss or alteration of brain function [134].\nThere is no demonstrable physical damage to the brain [134].\nAbout 90% of patients with a concussion do not lose consciousness [135].\nA patient may be confused or have amnesia [136].\nRetrograde amnesia is the inability to remember events leading up to the\ninjury [137].\nAnterograde amnesia is the inability to remember the events of the injury\n[137].\nUsually, a concussion lasts only a short time [138].\nAsk about symptoms like dizziness, weakness, visual changes, or mood\nchanges [138].\nAdditional signs include nausea, vomiting, ringing in the ear, slurred\nspeech, and inability to focus [139].\nAssume a patient with concussion signs has a more serious injury until\nproven otherwise [140].\nA contusion is bruising of the brain tissue [140].\nIt results from blunt trauma [140].\nA contusion is far more serious than a concussion [141].\nIt involves physical injury to the brain tissue [142].\nIt may cause long-lasting or permanent damage [142].\nPatients with a brain contusion may show all signs of a brain injury [143].\n8. Non-Traumatic Brain Injuries\nBrain injuries can also come from medical conditions [144].\nThese include blood clots or hemorrhages [144].\nProblems with blood vessels or high blood pressure can cause spontaneous\nbleeding [144].\nSigns and symptoms of a non-traumatic injury are often the same as\ntraumatic brain injury [145].\n9. Spinal Injuries: Mechanisms and Findings\nThe cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine can be injured in many ways [146].\nCompression injuries can result from a fall [147].\nThis is true regardless of how the patient landed [147].\nForces can compress the vertebrae bodies [148].\nThis can cause disc herniation and compression on the spinal cord [148].\nFragmentation into the spinal canal is possible [148].\nMotor vehicle crashes can overextend or hyperflex the cervical spine [149].\nThis can damage ligaments and joints [149].\nRotation flexion injuries result from rapid acceleration forces [150].\nAny unnatural motion can result in a fracture or neurological deficit [151].\nHyperextension occurs when the spine is pulled along its length [152].\nThis can cause fractures, ligament, and muscle injuries [152].\nWhen spine bones are altered by trauma, they can fracture or move [153].\nPermanent damage may occur [154].\nCommon findings include pain and tenderness on palpation [155].\nTake extra precautions when stabilizing the spine if these injuries are\nsuspected [155].\n10. Patient Assessment for Head and Spine Injuries\nStep Focus Key Actions\nRecognizing\nMOI\nIdentify\nmechanisms\nsuggestive of\nhead or spinal\ninjury [156]\nSuspect injury in motor vehicle collisions\n(especially motorcycles, snowmobiles, ATVs),\npedestrian/vehicle collisions, falls (>20 ft\nadult, >10 ft pediatric), blunt trauma,\npenetrating trauma to head/back/torso, rapid\ndeceleration, hangings, axial loading, diving\naccidents [156]\nScene Sizeup\nEnsure scene\nsafety and\nidentify hazards\n[157]\nEvaluate for hazards [157] Be prepared with\nstandard precautions [157] Call for ALS early in\nMVC [157] Consider the mechanism of injury to\npredict likely injuries [158]\nPrimary\nAssessment\nIdentify and\nmanage lifethreatening\nconcerns [160]\nFocus on threats to circulation, airway, and\nbreathing [161] Treat life threats immediately\n[161] Recognize critical patients quickly [162]\nReduce on-scene time for critical patients [162]\nIncrease survival chance or reduce damage for\ncritical patients [162]\nAlways suspect a possible head or spinal cord injury with certain mechanisms\nof injury [156].\nMechanisms suggesting injury include:\nMotor vehicle collisions, especially motorcycles, snowmobiles, and ATVs\n[156]\nPedestrian or motor vehicle collisions [156]\nFalls greater than 20 feet for adults or 10 feet for pediatrics [156]\nBlunt trauma [156]\nPenetrating trauma to the head, back, or torso [157]\nRapid deceleration injuries [157]\nHangings [157]\nAxial loading injuries [157]\nDiving accidents [157]\nDuring scene size-up, ensure the scene is safe [157].\nEvaluate the scene for hazards to your health, your team, or bystanders [157].\nUse appropriate standard precautions [157].\nCall for advanced life support (ALS) as soon as possible in motor vehicle\ncrashes [157].\nConsider how the mechanism of injury might have produced the expected\ninjuries [158].\nThe primary assessment focuses on identifying and managing lifethreatening\nconcerns [160].\nThreats to circulation, airway, and breathing are life-threatening [161].\nThey must be treated immediately [161].\nReducing on-scene time and recognizing critical patients increases survival\nchances [162].\nThis can also reduce irreversible damage [162].\n11. Spinal Immobilization Considerations\nBe aware that any unnecessary patient movement can cause additional\ninjuries [163].\nAssess the scene first to determine the risk of injury [164].\nForm a general impression of the patient based on their level of\nconsciousness and chief complaint [164].\nConsider not using spinal restriction if the patient is clear-thinking [165].\nThis is also true if they have no neurological deficits or spinal\npain/tenderness [165].\nConsider this if there is no evidence of intoxication or other conditions\nmasking spinal injury [165].\nThe backboard is rigid and can place the patient in an incorrect position [166].\nCirculation to skin areas may be compromised [167].\nSome patients may have respiratory compromise laying flat [167].\nMinimize the time a patient is on a backboard [167].\nApply a cervical collar after assessing airway and breathing [168].\nProvide necessary treatments before applying the collar [168].\nOnce the cervical collar is on, do not move it unless it causes problems [169].\nProblems include difficulty maintaining the airway [169].\nSigns of increasing ICP are another reason to remove it [169].\nIf the device must be removed, maintain manual stabilization of the cervical\nspine [170].\nKeep manual stabilization until the collar can be replaced [170].\n12. Assessing for Signs and Symptoms\nAsk the responsive patient specific questions [171].\nAsk what happened [171].\nAsk where it hurts [171].\nAsk if their neck or back hurts [171].\nAsk if they can move their hands and feet [171].\nAsk if they hit their head [171].\nConfused or slurred speech can indicate a head injury [171].\nRepetitive questioning or amnesia also suggest head injury in responsive\npatients [171].\nIn trauma, assume a head injury until proven otherwise [172].\nDecreased blood glucose levels can mimic these symptoms [173].\nPatients with a decreased level of responsiveness should be considered to\nhave a spinal cord injury [173].\nThis consideration is based on their chief complaint [173].\n13. Airway, Breathing, and Circulation Management\nIf spinal injury is suspected, open and assess the airway [174].\nManually hold the patient's head still while assessing the airway [175].\nUse the jaw-thrust maneuver to open the airway [176].\nIf jaw-thrust is ineffective, the head-tilt, chin-lift is a last resort [177].\nVomiting can occur in patients with a head injury [178].\nIrregular breathing, like Cheyne-Stokes, may result from increased ICP [179].\nAdminister high flow oxygen to patients with head and spinal injuries [180].\nPulse oximetry values should ideally be 95 or higher [181].\nThey should not fall below 90 [181].\nAvoid hyperventilation (ventilating too fast or with too much force) [182].\nUse hyperventilation only when capnography is available [182].\nEnsure an end tidal CO2 between 30 to 35 during hyperventilation [182].\nA pulse that is too slow in a head injury patient can indicate a serious\ncondition [183].\nA single episode of hypoperfusion can lead to significant brain damage or\ndeath [184].\nAssess for signs and symptoms of shock and treat appropriately [184].\nControl bleeding [185].\n14. Transport Considerations\nThe manner of transport is important for trauma patients [186].\nKeep several transport considerations in mind for head trauma patients [187].\nPatients with impaired airways, open head wounds, or abnormal vital signs\nmay need rapid extrication [187].\nPatients who do not respond to painful stimuli also need rapid extrication and\ntransport [187].\nEnsuring a patient's airway is paramount [188].\nProviding high flow oxygen is also paramount [188].\nThere is a probability of vomiting and seizures [189].\nSuction should be readily available [189].\nA head trauma patient may deteriorate rapidly [190].\nThey may require air medical transport [191].\nIn supine patients, the head should be elevated 30 degrees if possible [192].\nThis helps with ICP [192].\nRemember to maintain immobilization of the spine [193].\n15. History Taking and Secondary Assessment\nInvestigate the chief complaint during history taking [194].\nObtain a medical history [194].\nBe alert for injury-specific signs and symptoms [194].\nAlso look for any pertinent negatives [194].\nIf the patient is not responsive, try to get history from other sources [195].\nThese include friends, family members, or medical identification [195].\nCheck cards in wallets [195].\nMake every attempt to get a SAMPLE history [196].\nIn the secondary assessment, the ability to move extremities or feel\nsensations does not rule out spinal injury [196].\nAbsence of pain also does not necessarily rule out spinal injury [196].\nInstruct the patient to keep still and not move their head or neck [197].\nPerform a physical exam, which can be systematic or focused [198].\nPerform a secondary assessment en route if time permits [199].\nObtain a complete set of vital signs [200].\nVital signs are essential in addition to hands-on assessment [200].\nUse monitoring devices to quantify oxygen and circulatory status [201].\nMaintain end tidal CO2 between 35 and 40 [201].\nMaintain an SPO2 above 94 [201].\nUse the DCAP-BTLS exam to examine the head, chest, abdomen,\nextremities, and back [202].\nCheck perfusion, motor function, and sensation in all extremities before\nmoving the patient [202].\nA decreased level of consciousness is the most reliable sign of head injury\n[203].\nDetermine if there is decreased movement or numbness/tingling in\nextremities [203].\nLook for blood or CSF leaking from the ears, mouth, or nose [204].\nAlso look for bruising around the eyes or behind the ears [204].\nAssess pupil size and reaction to light [204].\nContinue to monitor the pupils [204].\nDo not probe open scalp lacerations with a gloved finger [205].\nThis may push bone fragments into the brain [205].\nDo not remove an impaled object from an open head injury [205].\n16. Neurologic and Spine Examination\nExamination\nType\nAssessment\nFocus\nTechniques / Findings Score/Scale\nNeurologic\nExam\nBaseline\nassessment of\nconsciousness\nlevels [206]\nAssess level of\nconsciousness [206] Record\nfluctuating or deteriorating\nlevels [208]\nGlasgow Coma\nScale (GCS)\n[206] Revised\nTrauma Score\n(RTS) if used\n[207]\nSpine Exam Inspect and\npalpate the\nspine, assess for\nimpairment [209]\nInspect for DCAP-BTLS [209]\nCheck extremities for\ncirculation [209] Note the level\nof impairment [209] Palpate\nfor pain or tenderness [210]\nLook for obvious deformity,\nnumbness, weakness,\ntingling, soft tissue\nemergencies [211] Observe for\nobvious injuries to head/neck\nsuggesting cervical spine\ninjury [212]\nNone specified\nPerform a baseline neurologic examination using the Glasgow Coma Scale\n(GCS) [206].\nIf your jurisdiction uses the Revised Trauma Score (RTS), use GCS findings for\nRTS [207].\nRecord levels of consciousness that fluctuate or deteriorate [208].\nThe GCS categories are shown in a table [208].\nPerform a spine exam [209].\nInspect for DCAP-BTLS [209].\nCheck the extremities for circulation [209].\nIf impairment is present, note the level [209].\nPain or tenderness on palpation is a warning sign of possible spine injury [210].\nOther signs include obvious deformity [211].\nNumbness, weakness, or tingling of the extremities are also signs [211].\nSoft tissue emergencies in the spinal region may be present [211].\nObvious injuries to the head or neck may indicate injury to the cervical spine\n[212].\n17. Reassessment and Interventions\nRepeat the primary assessment during reassessment [213].\nReassess signs and symptoms and the chief complaint [213].\nRecheck the patient's interventions [213].\nReassess the patient's condition at least every five minutes [214].\nRapid deterioration of neurologic signs after a head injury is a sign of\nexpanding hematoma [215].\nIt can also indicate rapidly progressing brain swelling [215].\nIf CSF is present, cover the wound with sterile gauze [216].\nThis prevents further contamination [216].\nDo not bandage it tightly [216].\nYour protocol should include administering high-flow O2 [217].\nApply a cervical collar if indicated as part of spinal immobilization [217].\nReassessment should occur as the patient is transported [218].\nTransport to an appropriate trauma facility [218].\n18. Communication and Documentation\nProvide complete and detailed information to the destination facility [219].\nAdvanced warning helps hospitals prepare for seriously injured patients [220].\nDescribe the most serious problems found during assessment [220].\nMore seriously injured patients should be documented [221].\nDocument their vital signs every five minutes [221].\nFor more stable patients, document vital signs every 15 minutes [222].\nYou may be asked to testify as a witness [223].\nBe sure to properly document [223].\n19. Emergency Care for Head Injuries\nThere are three general principles for head injury emergency care [225].\nThese principles protect and maintain critical functions of the central nervous\nsystem [225].\nYou need to establish an adequate airway [226].\nControl bleeding [226].\nProvide adequate circulation to maintain cerebral perfusion [226].\nAssess the patient's baseline level of consciousness [227].\nContinuously monitor the level of consciousness [227].\nThe most important step is establishing and maintaining an adequate airway\n[227].\nOnce the airway is open, maintain the head and cervical spine in a neutral\ninline position [228].\nKeep this position until a cervical collar is placed [228].\nAlso keep this position until the patient is secured on the backboard [228].\nRemove any foreign body secretions or vomit from the airway [230].\nCheck ventilation after clearing the airway [230].\nGive supplemental oxygen to any patient with a suspected head injury [231].\nThis is especially important for anyone having trouble breathing [231].\nUse a BVM to assist ventilations if the patient is breathing too slow or shallow\n[232].\nPlacement of an airway device may be necessary [232].\nConsider calling for ALS if the patient's airway is compromised [233].\nBegin CPR if the patient is in cardiac arrest [234].\nActive blood loss can aggravate hypoxia [235].\nBleeding inside the skull may cause ICP to rise to life-threatening levels [235].\nBleeding from a scalp laceration can almost always be controlled with direct\npressure [237].\nIf a skull fracture is suspected, do not apply excessive pressure to the wound\n[238].\nIf a dressing becomes soaked, do not remove it [239].\nPlace a second dressing over the first [239].\nShock is usually due to hypovolemia from bleeding from other injuries [240].\nTransport immediately to a trauma center [240].\nCushing's triad indicates increased intracranial pressure [241].\nIt includes increased blood pressure (hypertension) [241].\nIt also includes decreased heart rate (bradycardia) [241].\nFinally, it includes irregular respirations [242].\nIf Cushing's triad continues, it is fatal [242].\nManage shock [243].\nAdminister oxygen [243].\nVentilate as necessary [243].\nAvoid hyperventilation [243].\n20. Emergency Care for Spinal Injuries\nRemember to follow standard precautions [245].\nMaintain the patient's airway while keeping the spine in the proper position\n[245].\nAssess respirations and give supplemental oxygen if needed [246].\nManually manage the airway using the jaw thrust maneuver [246].\nConsider inserting an OPA [247].\nHave a suction unit available [247].\nProvide supplemental oxygen if needed [247].\nFor spinal motion restriction of the cervical spine, immobilize the head and\ntrunk [248].\nThis prevents bone fragments from causing further damage [248].\nEven small movements can cause significant injury [249].\nNever force the head into a neutral position [250].\nDo not move the head further if the patient reports certain symptoms [250].\nThese symptoms include muscle spasms [250].\nIncreased pain, numbness, tingling, or weakness in arms/legs are also reasons\nnot to move the head [250].\nA compromised airway or ventilations also mean not moving the head [250].\nIn these situations, stabilize the patient in their current position [250].\n21. Spinal Immobilization Devices and Techniques\nCervical collars provide preliminary partial support [251].\nThey should be applied to every patient with a possible spinal injury [252].\nThis is based on mechanism of injury, history, or signs/symptoms [252].\nA rigid cervical collar must be the correct size to be effective [252].\nAfter manual head/neck stabilization, assess pulse, motor functions, and\nsensations in all extremities [253].\nThen assess the spinal cord area and neck [253].\nMaintain manual support until the patient is fully secured to the backboard or\nvacuum mattress [254].\nFor supine patients, secure the patient to the long backboard [254].\nProcedures to move patients from the ground include a four-person log roll\n[255].\nYou may also slide the patient onto the backboard or vacuum mattress [256].\nThe vacuum mattress is an alternative to the long backboard [257].\nIt molds to the body contours, reducing pressure points and providing\ncomfort [257].\nIt also provides thermal insulation [258].\nIt is excellent for the elderly or patients with abnormal spinal curvature [259].\nIts thickness requires careful movement to maintain C-spine [260].\nIt cannot be used for patients over 350 pounds [261].\nIt cannot be used on spine sitting or standing patients [261].\nPatients can be moved onto it with a scoop stretcher or log roll [262].\nFor sitting patients, use a short board or other extrication device [263].\nThis restricts movement of the cervical and thoracic spine [263].\nThen secure the short backboard to the long backboard [263].\nExceptions include dangerous situations requiring immediate access to others\n[264].\nAnother exception is when injuries justify urgent removal [264].\nA standing patient should gently sit down [267].\nThen transfer them to a position where spinal motion restriction can be\nmaintained [267].\nIf mechanism or clinical signs suggest spinal injury, establish spinal motion\nrestriction [268].\nClinical indications include spinal tenderness or pain [269].\nAltered level of consciousness or neurologic deficits are indicators [269].\nObvious anatomic deformity to the spine or high energy trauma in intoxicated\npatients are also indicators [269].\nPain may be missed due to shock or attention on other painful areas [270].\nAssume spinal injury in all patients with a head injury [270].\nThis is because manipulating an unstable cervical spine can cause permanent\ndamage [270].\nUse manual inline stabilization or a cervical collar and long backboard [271].\nA short backboard is designed to immobilize the head, neck, and torso [274].\nIt is used for non-critical seated patients with possible spinal injuries [275].\nLong backboards provide full body stabilization [276].\nThey are used to immobilize patients found in any position [277].\n22. Helmet Removal\nA well-fitting helmet should be left on if it prevents head movement [279].\nThis is true if there are no airway or breathing problems [279].\nIt should not interfere with airway/ventilation assessment and treatment\n[280].\nYou must be able to properly immobilize the spine [280].\nRemove the helmet if it is a full-face helmet [281].\nRemove it if it makes assessing or managing airway problems difficult [281].\nRemove it if removing the face guard is not possible to improve airway access\n[281].\nRemove it if it prevents proper spine immobilization [281].\nAlso remove it if it allows excessive head movement [282].\nRemove the helmet if the patient is in cardiac arrest [282].\nThe preferred removal method requires at least two people [283].\nThe technique depends on the helmet type [284].\nYou and your partner should not move at the same time [285].\nConsult medical control about the decision to remove the helmet [285].\nAn alternate method allows removal with less force [287].\nThis reduces the likelihood of neck motion [287].\nThe disadvantage is that it is slightly more time consuming [288].\nSteps for the alternate method include removing the chin strap and face mask\n[289].\nPop the jaw pads out of place [289].\nPlace your finger inside the helmet during removal [289].\nOne person controls the head by holding the jaw and occiput [289].\nInsert padding behind the occiput to prevent neck extension [290].\nThe person at the chest is responsible for ensuring head and neck do not\nmove [291].\nSmall children may need extra padding for inline stabilization [292].\n23. Review Questions and Conclusion\nReview questions cover key concepts from the chapter [294].\nThe central nervous system parts are cerebrum, cerebellum, brain stem\n[294].\nBlood loss from scalp lacerations contributes to hypovolemic shock [296].\nImmediate loss of consciousness followed by a lucid interval suggests an\nepidural hematoma [297].\nA patient struck in the head who was briefly unconscious, has a headache\nand sees stars, and regained memory has a concussion [298].\nNo memory of events leading up to an accident is retrograde amnesia [300]\n.\nMemory of the actual event is anterograde amnesia [302].\nA distraction injury to the cervical spine is likely from a hanging\nmechanism [303].\nManual stabilization of the head must be maintained until a patient with\npossible spinal injury is fully immobilized [304].\nFor a semi-conscious patient with face and head trauma, blood in the\nmouth, and snoring sounds, manually stabilize the head, log roll, and\nsuction [305].\nFor an unconscious patient slumped over a steering wheel with head\nturned and neck flexed, manually stabilize and move into a neutral inline\nposition [308].\nDo not remove an injured football player's helmet if the face guard can be\neasily removed and there's no airway compromise [309].\nThis concludes the lecture on head and spine injuries [310].",
