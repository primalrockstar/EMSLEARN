They are different from\ntrauma emergencies, which result from physical forces [5]. Patients can have both\nmedical and trauma conditions [7].\nType of Medical\nEmergency\nDescription Common Examples\nRespiratory\nEmergencies\nDifficulty breathing or\ninadequate oxygen supply\n[9]\nTrouble breathing [9]\nCardiovascular\nEmergencies\nConditions affecting the\ncirculatory system [10]\nHeart conditions [10]\nNeurological\nEmergencies\nInvolve the brain [11] Seizure, stroke, fainting [143]\nGastrointestinal\nConditions\nInvolve the digestive\nsystem [11]\nAppendicitis, diverticulitis,\npancreatitis [11]\nUrologic Emergency Involve the urinary system\n[12]\nKidney stones [12]\nEndocrine Emergencies Related to hormones [12] Complications of diabetes\n[12]\nHematologic\nEmergencies\nInvolve the blood [13] Sickle cell disease, blood\nclotting disorders [13]\nImmunologic\nEmergencies\nBody's response to foreign\nsubstances [14]\nAllergic reactions [14]\nToxicological\nEmergencies\nInvolve poisoning and\nsubstance abuse [14]\nPoisoning [14]\nPhysiological or\nBehavioral Problems\nDifficult to assess [15] Conditions without typical\nsigns and symptoms [15]\nGynecological\nConditions\nInvolve female reproductive\norgans [16]\nFemale reproductive issues\n[16]\n2. Patient Assessment in Medical Emergencies\nAssessing a medical patient focuses on the nature of illness and chief complaint [19].\nEstablishing an accurate medical history is crucial [20]. Use dispatch information to guide\nyour response [21]. Avoid tunnel vision, focusing only on one aspect [22]. Maintain a\nprofessional and calm demeanor [23]. Do not label patients or show biases [24].\nRemember a frequent caller may have a different complaint this time [25].\nThe scene size-up ensures safety for you, your crew, and the patient [26]. Use standard\nprecautions [27]. Determine the number of patients and if more help is needed [27].\nDetermine the nature of the illness [28]. Be aware of potentially serious underlying\nconditions (index of suspicion) [28]. Initiate spinal immobilization if necessary [28].\nThe primary assessment includes forming a general impression [29]. Perform a rapid\nexam to find life threats [29]. Determine the patient's level of consciousness using AVPU\n[29]. Assess airway, breathing, and circulation (ABC) [29].\nFor conscious patients, ensure an open airway and adequate breathing [30].\nCheck respiratory rate, depth, and quality [30].\nConsider oxygen if breathing is affected [30].\nCheck the radial pulse [33].\nObserve skin color, type, and condition [33].\nFor unconscious patients, open the airway using the proper technique [31].\nEvaluate breathing for several seconds [31].\nApply oxygen, especially with shock, difficulty breathing, or low SpO2 (<94%)\n[32].\nMay need airway adjuncts and ventilatory assistance with a bag valve mask\n[32].\nCheck circulation at the carotid artery [34].\nMake a transport decision based on the patient's condition [34].\nHistory taking helps determine the problem or its cause [38]. Gather a thorough history\n[39]. Investigate the chief complaint using opqrst (onset, provocation, quality, radiation,\nseverity, time) [41]. For unconscious patients, survey the scene for medications and\nmedical devices [40]. Obtain patient history using SAMPLE (allergies, medications, past\nhistory, last oral intake, events) [41]. Record all allergies and medications [41]. Take\nmedications with you to the hospital [41].\nThe secondary assessment may happen on scene or en route [42]. Sometimes there is\nno time for a secondary assessment [43]. Conscious patients get a limited or detailed\nphysical exam based on the chief complaint [44]. Unconscious patients always get a\nhead-to-toe exam to find clues [45]. A full body assessment should be quick to avoid\ndelaying transport [46]. Examine the head, neck, chest, abdomen, extremities, and back\n[46].\nTreatment depends on findings and local protocols [47]. Take vital signs: pulse rate,\nrhythm, and quality [48]. Assess respirations rate, quality, and regularity [49]. Obtain an\ninitial blood pressure [50]. Measure systolic and diastolic pressures [51]. Consider using an\nautomatic blood pressure cuff [51]. Obtain blood glucose levels and pulse oximetry [52].\n3. Reassessment and Transport Decisions\nReassessment starts after initial assessment and treatment [53]. It continues throughout\ntransport [53]. Repeat the primary assessment [54]. Reassess the chief complaint [54].\nConsider the need for advanced life support [55]. Repeat the physical exam to find and\ntreat changes [56]. Obtain vital signs every 5 minutes for unstable patients [58]. Obtain\nvital signs every 15 minutes for stable patients [58]. Review all performed treatments [59].\nDocument any changes from treatments [59]. Adjust treatments as needed [59].\nMost emergencies need hospital treatment beyond pre-hospital care [60]. The hospital\noffers advanced testing [61]. Administering medicine may be beyond the EMT's scope [61]\n. EMTs need direct permission from medical control to give medicine [62]. EMTs can use\nan AED on pulseless and apneic patients [63].\nScene time may be longer for medical patients [65]. This allows gathering more\ninformation for the emergency department [65]. Critical patients need rapid transport [66].\nCriteria for Rapid Transport\nUnconscious or altered mental status [36]\nAirway or breathing problems [36]\nObvious circulation problems (bleeding, shock) [36]\nVery old or very young patients [66]\nLife-threatening conditions require transport with lights and sirens [67]. Non-critical\npatients may use non-emergency transport [68]. Transport modes are ground or air [68].\nGround units have EMTs and paramedics [69]. Air units have critical care transport\nprofessionals and paramedics [70]. Generally, transport to the closest hospital [71].\nSometimes another hospital is better for the patient's specific condition [72].\n4. Infectious Diseases in Emergency Care\nApproach patients with infectious diseases like other medical patients [73]. Perform\nscene size-up and standard precautions [73]. Complete the primary assessment [73].\nGather patient history using opqrst for the chief complaint [74]. Obtain sample history\nand baseline vital signs [75]. Pay attention to medicines and events leading up to the\nproblem [76]. Ask about recent travel or contact with travelers [77].\nGeneral management focuses on life-threatening conditions from the primary\nassessment [78]. Be empathetic [79]. Position the patient for comfort on the stretcher [80].\nKeep the patient warm [80]. Always use standard precautions [80]. Follow agency\nexposure control plans [81]. Clean equipment properly [81]. Discard disposable supplies\nand wash linens [81].\nInfectious\nDisease\nCharacteristics Transmission PPE\nRecommendations\nInfluenza\n[84]\nSusceptible: chronic conditions,\ncompromised immune systems,\nvery young/old [84]\nDirect contact\nwith nasal\nsecretions,\nGloves, eye\nprotection,\nHEPA/N95 mask\n[85]\nairborne\ndroplets [84]\nHerpes\nSimplex [88]\nTiny fluid blisters on\nlips/genitals [89].

A: transmitted\nfrom acute infection [101]. B/C:\ntransmitted from long-term\ncarriers [102]\nA: oral or\nfecal\ncontamination\n[103]. B: far\nmore\ncontagious\nthan HIV [104]\nVaccination (Hep\nB) recommended\nfor EMTs [104]\nMeningitis\n[106]\nInflammation of meningeal\ncovering [106]. Most forms not\ncontagious [107].

Patients recently outside the US may have\nfever, cough, vomiting, bloody diarrhea, body aches, rashes [136]. Place a mask on the\npatient [136]. Gather information on travel history [136]. Ask where they traveled, if\nvaccinated, exposed, if travel companions are sick, food/water sources [137]. Follow\nappropriate PPE and notify receiving facility if a communicable disease is suspected [137]\n.\nAn epidemic is when new cases exceed expectations [82]. A pandemic is a global\noutbreak [83].\n5. Conclusion and Key Takeaways\nAssessing and treating medical patients is challenging [138]. Medical conditions may not\nbe as apparent as trauma [139]. Treatment may not be straightforward [139]. Delays in\ndiagnosis can be harmful [140]. Stay calm and use patient assessment skills [140]. Treat\nthe patient's symptoms [140]. Report to medical control [140]. Transport the patient safely\nto the emergency department [140]. Be prepared for patients with both medical and\ntrauma conditions [141].",
