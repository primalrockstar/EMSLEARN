Introduction to Trauma and Energy Concepts\nTraumatic injuries are the leading cause of death for people younger than 44 years\nold in the United States [6]. Trauma emergencies happen because of physical forces\non the body [7]. Understanding the mechanism of injury (MOI) helps predict serious\nunseen injuries [7]. This awareness is called index of suspicion [7].\nTraumatic injury happens when body tissues are exposed to energy beyond their\ntolerance [9]. MOI describes the forces causing the injury [10]. Three key energy\nconcepts related to injury are potential energy, kinetic energy, and work [11]. Energy\ncannot be created or destroyed, only changed [13].\nWork is force over distance [13]. Forces that bend or compress tissues cause\ninjury [14].\nkinetic energy is the energy of a moving object [14]. It relates to the object's\nmass (weight) and velocity (speed) [15].\npotential energy is related to the mass and gravity [15]. It's mostly linked to\nfalling objects [15].\nEnergy Type Description Relation to Injury\nPotential\nEnergy\nEnergy of falling\nobjects\nProduct of mass, gravity, and weight [15]\nKinetic Energy Energy of a moving\nobject\nRelationship between mass and\nvelocity [15]\nWork Force acting over\ndistance\nBending or compressing tissues causes\ninjury [13]\n2. Mechanisms of Injury: Blunt and Penetrating Trauma\nTraumatic injuries are categorized as blunt trauma or penetrating trauma [18].\nblunt trauma is caused by force without penetrating tissues or organs [18].\nCommon examples include motor vehicle crashes and falls [22]. Skin\ndiscoloration and pain might be the only signs [23]. It's important to have a\nhigh index of suspicion for hidden injuries [7].\npenetrating trauma occurs when objects pierce the body's surface [19]. This\ndamages soft tissues, internal organs, and body cavities [19].\nBoth types can happen from various MOIs [20].\nTrauma\nType\nCharacteristics Common\nMechanisms\nAssessment Clues\nBlunt Trauma Force without\npenetrating tissues or\norgans [18]\nMotor vehicle\ncrashes, falls [22]\nSkin discoloration,\npain, unseen injuries\n[23]\nPenetrating\nTrauma\nObjects pierce or\npenetrate body\nsurface [19]\nKnives, bullets\n[67]\nEntrance/Exit\nwounds, trajectory,\ncavitation [70]\n3. Motor Vehicle Crash Mechanisms and Associated Injuries\nA motor vehicle crash typically involves three collisions [23]. The vehicle's condition\ncan indicate the MOI [24].\nFirst collision: Vehicle against an object (e.g., a tree) [23].\nSecond collision: Passenger against the car's interior [24]. kinetic energy is\nconverted to work of stopping the body [24]. Common injuries include lower\nextremity fractures, rib fractures, and head trauma [25].\nThird collision: Passenger's internal organs against body structures [26].\nInternal injuries may be life-threatening but not obvious externally [26].\nSignificant MOIs in crashes include:\nDeath of an occupant [27].\nSevere vehicle deformity or intrusion [27].\nModerate lateral intrusion or severe rear damage [27].\nCrashes with rotation involved [27].\nEjection from the vehicle [27].\nDifferent crash types cause specific injury patterns:\nFrontal crashes: Evaluate restraint systems and airbag deployment [28]. Seat\nbelts and airbags prevent the second collision's severity [29]. Airbags\ndecrease deceleration injuries to chest, face, and head [30]. Suspect extremity\nand internal organ injuries despite airbags [31]. Improper restraints can cause\ninjuries; seat belts too low cause hip dislocations, too high cause internal\ninjuries, and lumbar spine fractures are possible [33].\nRear-end crashes: Known for whiplash injuries, especially without a proper\nheadrest [36]. Acceleration injury to the brain is possible [38]. Rear passengers\nwith only a lap belt may injure the thoracic and lumbar spine [38].\nLateral crashes: Common cause of death [40]. Vehicle rocks away from the\nimpact side [41]. Passenger sustains a whiplash-type injury [41]. Substantial\nintrusion suggests lateral chest and abdominal injuries, lower extremity and\npelvis fractures, or rib fractures and organ damage [42].\nRollover crashes: Large trucks and SUVs are prone due to high center of\ngravity [43]. Injuries depend on restraint use [44]. Ejection is the most common\nlife-threatening event [45]. Severe injuries can occur even when restrained [46].\nRotational crashes (spins): Similar to rollovers [47]. Vehicle spinning can\nstrike objects like utility poles [48].\nCrash\nType\nMechanism Common Injuries\nFrontal Vehicle strikes\nobject head-on\nLower extremity fractures, ribs, head trauma\n(passenger vs interior) [25], extremity/internal\norgan injuries (despite airbags) [31]\nRear-end Vehicle struck\nfrom behind\nWhiplash, acceleration brain injury [36],\nthoracic/lumbar spine injury (lap belt only) [38]\nLateral Vehicle struck\nfrom the side\nWhiplash, lateral chest/abdominal injuries, lower\nextremity/pelvis fractures, rib/organ damage [41]\nRollover Vehicle rolls over Ejection (most common life-threat) [45], severe\ninjuries even when restrained [46]\nRotational Vehicle spins Injuries from striking objects during spin [48]\n4. Other Blunt Trauma Mechanisms: Pedestrian, Bicycle,\nMotorcycle, and Falls\nOther blunt trauma mechanisms also cause significant injuries.\nCar versus Pedestrian: Injuries are often graphic and obvious [49]. Serious\nunseen injuries are also possible [49]. Key factors include vehicle speed, if the\npatient was thrown and how far, where they landed, and if they were pulled\nunder the vehicle [50]. Evaluate the striking vehicle for damage [51]. ALS should\nbe called for significant MOI [52].\nCar versus Bicycle: Evaluate similarly to car versus pedestrian crashes [53].\nAssess bicycle damage and position [53]. Inspect the helmet for damage [53].\nPresume spinal cord injury until ruled out at the hospital [53]. Spinal\nimmobilization is crucial [53].\nCar versus Motorcycle: Helmets offer protection but not against severe\ncervical injury [54]. Leather or abrasion-resistant clothing protects against\nroad abrasion but not blunt trauma [55]. Boots protect feet [55]. When\nassessing, look for motorcycle deformity, side of most damage, skid distance,\ndamage to other objects, and helmet deformity [56]. There are four types of\nmotorcycle impacts:\nHead-on: Motorcycle stops, rider continues forward [57].\nAngular: Motorcycle strikes object at an angle; rider's lower extremity is\ncrushed [58].\nEjection: Rider travels at high speed until stopped by an object or road\ndrag [59].\nControlled crash: Rider separates from the motorcycle before impact\n(laying the bike down) [60].\nFalls: Injury potential relates to the fall height [62]. Greater height means\ngreater potential energy [62]. A fall over 20 feet is significant [63]. Internal\ninjuries are the greatest threat [63]. Landing on feet may lessen internal\ninjuries but cause serious lower extremity and pelvis injuries [64]. Spinal\ninjuries are possible [64]. Consider fall height, surface struck, body part that\nhit first, and energy displacement path [64].\n5. Penetrating Trauma: Low, Medium, and High Velocity\npenetrating trauma is the second leading cause of death after blunt trauma [66]. It\ncan be caused by low, medium, or high energy impacts.\nLow energy penetrating trauma: Caused by objects like knives or ice picks\n[67]. Injuries are from sharp edges moving through tissue, close to the object's\npath [68]. Knives moved internally can cause more damage than external\nwounds suggest [69].\nMedium and high velocity penetrating trauma: Usually caused by bullets [70]\n. The bullet's path can be unpredictable; it may flatten, tumble, or ricochet [71].\nThe path is called the trajectory [72]. Fragmentation increases damage [72].\ncavitation results from rapid tissue/fluid pressure changes [72].\nTemporary cavitation: Tissue stretching from pressure changes [73].\nPermanent cavitation: Injury closer to the bullet path that remains after\npassage [73].\nThe distance and injury severity depend on the weapon type [74]. Air resistance\n(drag) slows the projectile, reducing penetration depth and energy [75]. The damaged\narea from medium/high velocity projectiles is much larger than the projectile's\ndiameter [76]. Exit wounds are often larger than entrance wounds for this reason [77].\nEnergy's ability to cause damage is more about speed than mass [78]. The type of\ntissue the projectile passes through significantly impacts injury seriousness [79].\nVelocity Characteristics Damage Mechanism\nLow Velocity Objects like knives or\nice picks [67]\nSharp edges moving through tissue\n[68]\nMedium/High\nVelocity\nUsually bullets [70] Trajectory, fragmentation, cavitation\n(temporary and permanent) [72]\n6. Blast Injuries: Mechanisms and Affected Tissues\nBlast injuries are seen in civilian settings from explosions in mines, shipyards,\nchemical plants, and terrorist activities [81]. There are four mechanisms of blast\ninjuries [82].\nPrimary blast injuries: Caused entirely by the blast's pressure wave [83].\nSecondary blast injuries: Damage from flying debris hitting the body [84].\ntertiary blast injuries: Victim is thrown by the explosion force against a\nstationary object [85].\nQuaternary blast injuries: Burns from hot gases, respiratory injury from toxic\ngas, crush injury from building collapse, suffocation, poisoning, or other\nmedical emergencies/contamination [86].\nMost survivors have a combination of these four injury types [88]. Tissues containing\nair are most susceptible to pressure changes, like the middle ear, lungs, and GI tract\n[89].\nThe ear is the most sensitive [90].\npulmonary blasts are lung trauma from close exposure to detonations [91].\npneumothorax is common and may need field decompression [92]. arterial\nair emboli are concerning pulmonary blast injuries, occurring when air enters\nlung blood vessels, potentially causing vision issues, behavioral changes,\nconsciousness changes, or neurological signs [93].\nSolid organs are somewhat protected but can be injured by secondary\nmissiles or being thrown [94].\nNeurologic injuries and head trauma are the most common causes of death\nfrom blast injuries [94]. Extremity injuries, including traumatic amputations,\nare also frequent [95].\nBlast\nMechanism\nDescription Example Injuries\nPrimary Pressure wave from\nexplosion [83]\nEar damage, pulmonary blast\ninjuries [90]\nSecondary Struck by flying debris [84] Penetrating wounds, fractures\n[84]\nTertiary Victim is thrown against\nobject [85]\nFractures, head trauma, internal\ninjuries [85]\nQuaternary Burns, toxic inhalation, crush\ninjury, etc. [86]\nBurns, respiratory issues,\nsuffocation, poisoning [86]\n7. Multi-System Trauma and Pre-hospital Care Principles\nmulti-system trauma involves injury to more than one body system [96]. Examples\ninclude head/spine trauma, chest/abdomen injuries, or chest/multiple extremity\ninjuries [97]. Patients with multi-system trauma have high morbidity and mortality [98].\nRapid transport and medical control contact are important [97].\nThe golden principles of pre-hospital trauma care guide management [98]:\nEnsure safety: Your safety first, then crew safety, then patient safety [98].\nDetermine the need for additional personnel and equipment [100].\nEvaluate the mechanism of injury [100].\nIdentify and manage life threats [101].\nFocus on patient care [101].\nHemorrhage control is the highest priority [101].\nAccess and manage the airway, including ventilatory support and highflow\noxygen [102]. Maintain spinal restriction [102]. This is the second priority\n[102].\nEnsure other shock therapy is completed [102].\nProtect the spine and proceed with spinal immobilization if indicated [102].\nTransport the patient immediately to the appropriate facility [103]. Definitive\ncare for multi-system trauma often requires surgery [104]. Scene time should\nbe 10 minutes or less [104].\nDuring transport, obtain a SAMPLE history and complete the secondary\nassessment [105].\nConsider advanced life support (ALS) intercept or air medical transport\n[105].\n8. Patient Assessment and Injury Patterns by Body Region\nFor patients with a significant MOI and serious/critical condition, perform a rapid\nphysical exam [107]. Focus on the chief complaint while assessing the whole patient\n[108]. Common injury patterns are seen in different body regions.\nHead injuries: Disability and unseen brain injury can occur [110]. Bleeding or\nswelling inside the skull is often life-threatening [111]. Include frequent\nneurologic examinations [111]. Signs and symptoms may appear minutes or\nhours later [111].\nNeck and Throat injuries: Airway problems can quickly become lifethreatening\n[112]. Frequent physical exams, including DCAP-BTLS\n(Deformities, Contusions, Abrasions, Punctures/Penetrations, Burns,\nTenderness, Lacerations, Swelling), are essential [113]. Assess for jugular vein\ndistension and tracheal deviation [114]. Swelling can impede blood flow to\nthe brain [114]. Crushing injuries to the upper neck can fracture airway\ncartilage [115].\nChest injuries: The chest contains the heart, lungs, and large vessels [116].\nMany life-threatening injuries are possible [116].\nBroken ribs can hinder breathing [117].\nBruising to the heart can cause irregular rhythms [117].\nTorn large vessels can cause massive unseen bleeding [117].\nAir collection between the lung and chest wall is a pneumothorax [118].\nBlood collection in the chest is a hemothorax [118].\nA penetrating chest wound is an open chest wound [119].\nIf untreated, shock may occur [120]. Assess the chest every five minutes [120].\nAssessment includes DCAP-BTLS, lung sounds, and chest rise/fall [121].\nAbdomen injuries: The abdomen holds vital organs with high blood flow [122].\nSolid organs (liver, spleen, pancreas, kidneys) can tear, lacerate, or\nfracture, causing serious bleeding [123].\nHollow organs (stomach, intestines, bladder) can rupture, leaking toxic\ndigestive chemicals and causing life-threatening infection [125].\nRuptured blood vessels can cause serious unseen bleeding [126].\nBody\nRegion\nKey Assessment Points Common Injury Patterns\nHead Neurologic exams, check\nfor bleeding/swelling [110]\nUnseen brain injury, bleeding/swelling\ninside skull [110]\nNeck and\nThroat\nDCAP-BTLS, jugular vein\ndistension, tracheal\ndeviation [113]\nAirway problems, impeded blood flow\nto brain, fractured cartilage [112]\nChest DCAP-BTLS, lung sounds,\nchest rise/fall, assess\nevery 5 minutes [120]\nBroken ribs, heart bruising, torn\nvessels, pneumothorax, hemothorax,\nopen chest wound [117]\nAbdomen Assess for signs of\nsolid/hollow organ injury,\nbleeding [122]\nSolid organ tears/lacerations/fractures\n(bleeding), hollow organ rupture\n(infection) [123]\n9. Transport Decisions and Trauma Center Levels\nScene time survival is critical for trauma patients [127]. On-scene time for critically\ninjured patients should be less than 10 minutes [127].\nCriteria for identifying a critically injured patient include:\nDangerous mechanism of injury [128].\nDecreased level of consciousness [129].\nThreats to the airway, breathing, or circulation [129].\nVery young or very old patients, or those with chronic illness [129].\nTrauma centers are classified into levels one through four [130].\nLevel one: Provides every aspect of trauma care, most resources [131].\nLevel two: Provides initial definitive care [132].\nLevel three: Provides assessment, resuscitation, emergency care, and\nstabilization [133].\nLevel four: Provides advanced trauma life support [133].\nCriteria for using emergency air medical services for trauma patients:\nExtended time to access or extricate a remote/trapped patient [135].\nDistance to a trauma center is more than 20-25 miles [135].\nPatient needs advanced care, and no ALS ground ambulance is available [135].\nTraffic or hospital availability makes ground transport to a trauma center\nunlikely [136].\nMultiple trauma patients overwhelm nearby hospitals [137].\nEMS system requires transport to the nearest hospital instead of bypassing to\na trauma center, delaying definitive surgical care [138].\nMass casualty event [139].\nTrauma centers are categorized as adult or pediatric, not necessarily both [140].\nModes of transport are ground or air [141]. Ground units are staffed by EMTs and\nparamedics [142]. Air or critical care units are staffed by critical care nurses and\nparamedics [142]. Special considerations during transport include staying calm,\ncompleting a thorough assessment, correcting life-threatening injuries, doing no\nharm, and contacting ALS backup or medical control if needed [142].",
