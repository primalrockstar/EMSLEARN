Introduction to Medical, Legal, and Ethical Issues in Emergency\nCare\nThis report covers medical, legal, and ethical issues relevant to EMTs [1].\nIt will explain the ethical responsibilities and medical legal directives and\nguidelines for EMTs [2].\nKey concepts include confidentiality, consent to treat, refusal of care, and\nadvance directives [3].\nTopics like organ donor systems, evidence preservation, and end-of-life\nissues are also discussed [4].\nA basic principle is to do no further harm [6].\n2. Consent in Emergency Medical Care\nConsent is the permission to render care [9].\nA patient must give consent for treatment [9].\nThe foundation of consent is decision-making capacity [11].\nThis means the patient can understand and process information [11].\nThe patient can also make an informed choice [11].\nPatient autonomy is the patient's right to make decisions about their health\n[12].\nFactors for determining decision-making capacity include intellectual\ncapacity, legal age, and impairment from alcohol, drugs, injury, or illness [13].\nExpress consent means the patient acknowledges they want care and\ntransport [14].\nFor consent to be valid, it must be informed consent [15].\nYou must explain the nature of treatment, risks, benefits, alternatives,\nand consequences of refusing care [15].\nimplied consent applies to patients who are unconscious or incapable of\nmaking a rational decision [16].\nThis is based on the emergency doctrine [19].\nIt is used when a serious threat to life exists [17].\nTry to get consent from a spouse or relative if possible [20].\nInvoluntary consent applies to patients who are mentally ill, in a behavioral\ncrisis, or developmentally delayed [21].\nConsent should be obtained from a guardian or conservator [22].\nLocal provisions may allow for protective custody statutes [23].\nFor minors, the parent or legal guardian usually gives consent [25].\nSome states allow emancipated minors to give consent [25].\nemancipated minors may be married, in the armed services, or parents\n[26].\nSchool teachers or officials may provide consent for injuries at school or\ncamp [27].\nIn a true emergency with no consent available, consent is implied for\nminors [28].\nForcible restraint is necessary for combative patients who are a danger to\nthemselves or others [29].\nforcible restraint is legally permissible with medical control\nauthorization and law enforcement assistance [30].\nRestraining without legal authority can lead to civil and criminal penalties\n[30].\nDo not remove restraints en route unless they pose a risk [31].\nConsider ALS backup for chemical restraint [32].\nAdults with decision-making capacity have the right to refuse treatment\n[34].\nThey can withdraw from treatment at any time [35].\nRefusal of treatment calls require caution and involvement of medical\ncontrol [36].\nThe decision to refuse should be based on information provided by the\nEMT [37].\nWhen treatment is refused, assess the patient's ability to make an\ninformed decision [38].\nIf the patient is confused or delusional, you cannot assume the refusal is\ninformed [39].\nProviding treatment is often more defensible than failing to treat [40].\nEnsure your safety with law enforcement if needed [40].\nEncourage the patient to permit treatment and call back if their condition\nworsens or they change their mind [41].\nAdvise the patient to contact their own physician [43].\nAsk the patient to sign a refusal of treatment form with a witness [43].\nThoroughly document all refusals [44].\nConsent\nType\nDescription Applies To\nExpress\nConsent\nPatient directly agrees to care\nand transport\nConscious, rational, capable\npatients\nImplied\nConsent\nAssumed consent based on life\nthreat\nUnconscious or incapacitated\npatients\nInvoluntary\nConsent\nConsent obtained from\nguardian/conservator or legal\nauthority\nMentally ill, behavioral crisis,\nor developmentally delayed\npatients\nMinor\nConsent\nUsually parent/guardian, but can\nbe minor in certain cases\nPatients under legal age\n3. Confidentiality and HIPAA\nCommunication between the EMT and patient is confidential [45].\nConfidential information includes history, assessment findings, and\ntreatments [46].\nInappropriately releasing this information is breach of confidentiality [47].\nRecords can usually be released only with a patient signed release, a legal\nsubpoena, or for billing purposes [48].\nHIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) strengthened\nprivacy laws [49].\nHIPAA protects patient information obtained during medical treatment [51].\nThis is called Protected Health Information (PHI) [52].\nPHI includes medical information and identifiable information [53].\nFailure to follow HIPAA can result in civil or criminal action [54].\nThe general public is often allowed to record identifying patient information\n[55].\nEMTs should avoid associating with their agency on social media while off\nduty unless an official spokesperson [56].\nConduct yourself with the same professionalism online as on duty [58].\nRecognize that free speech has limitations [60].\n4. Advanced Directives and End-of-Life Issues\nadvanced directives are written documents specifying medical treatment\nfor a competent patient who becomes unable to make decisions [66].\nA Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) order gives permission to withhold\nresuscitation [63].\nA DNR does not mean do not treat [64].\nYou are obligated to provide supportive measures even with a DNR [65].\nadvanced directives are often called a living will or healthcare directive [66].\nValid DNR orders must meet specific requirements [67].\nThese requirements include a clear statement of the medical problem,\nsignatures of the patient/guardian and physician/healthcare provider, and\nan expiration date within the preceding 12 months [67].\nYou may encounter Physician's Orders for Sustaining Treatment (POST) or\nMedical Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (MOLST) forms for terminally\nill patients [70].\nThese forms explicitly describe acceptable interventions and must be\nsigned by an authorized medical provider [70].\nContact medical control if you encounter these documents [71].\nPatients may name surrogates called Durable Powers of Attorney for\nHealthcare or healthcare proxies [72].\nDetermining the cause of death is a medical responsibility of a physician\n[73].\npresumptive signs of death include unresponsiveness, lack of\npulse/heartbeat, absence of chest rise/fall, no reflexes, no pupillary activity,\nno blood pressure, profound cyanosis, and decreased body temperature [74].\ndefinitive signs of death are obvious mortal damage, dependent lividity, rigor\nmortis, algor mortis, and putrefaction [75].\ndependent lividity is blood settling to the lowest point of the body [76].\nrigor mortis is the stiffening of body muscles, occurring 2 to 12 hours after\ndeath [78].\nalgor mortis is the cooling of the body [80].\nputrefaction is the decomposition of body tissues, occurring 40 to 96 hours\nafter death [81].\nThe medical examiner or coroner must be notified in certain cases [82].\nThese cases include dead on arrival, death without previous medical care,\nphysician unable to state cause of death, suicide, violent death, poisoning,\naccident, suspicion of criminal act, and infant/child deaths [82].\nLimit your disturbance of a death scene [84].\nKeep thorough notes if emergency care is initiated at a death scene [84].\nTreat potential organ donors the same as any other patient [85].\nYour priority is to save the patient's life [85].\nOrgan donor information may be on a donor card or driver's license [85].\nmedical identification insignia (bracelets, necklaces, etc.) indicate\nconditions like DNRs, allergies, or serious medical conditions [85].\nValid DNR Requirement Description\nClear statement of the patient's\nmedical problem\nSpecifies the patient's condition\nSignature of the patient or legal\nguardian\nProvides authorization from the patient or\ntheir representative\nSignature of one or more physicians\nor licensed HCPs\nConfirms the medical order by a qualified\nprofessional\nDated within the preceding 12\nmonths\nEnsures the order is current\n5. Legal Aspects of EMT Practice\nscope of practice outlines the care you are able to provide [88].\nIt is usually defined by state law [88].\nThe medical director further defines the scope of practice through protocols\nor standing orders [89].\nAuthorization for treatment comes from the medical director [90].\nThis can be online (radio/telephone) or offline (standing orders/protocol)\n[90].\nCarrying out procedures outside the scope of practice can be considered\nnegligence [90].\nThe standard of care is the manner in which you must act or behave [91].\nIt is defined as how a person with similar training would act under similar\ncircumstances [92].\nStandards of care are established by local custom, law (statutes, ordinances,\nregulations, case law), professional/institutional standards, EMS agency\nrules, textbooks, and state medical practices acts [93].\nduty to act is an individual's responsibility to provide patient care [97].\nOnce your ambulance responds or treatment begins, you have a legal duty to\nact [97].\nIf off duty, you are generally not legally obligated to stop and assist [98].\nYou must know local laws and policies regarding duty to act [99].\nnegligence is the failure to provide the same care as a person with similar\ntraining in the same situation [101].\nFour factors must be present for negligence to apply: duty, breach of duty,\ndamages, and causation [102].\nDuty is the obligation to provide care [104].\nBreach of duty means the EMT did not act within the standard of care\n[104].\nDamages means the patient was physically or physiologically harmed\n[105].\nCausation is a cause and effect relationship between the breach of duty\nand the damages [106].\nres ipsa loquitur means the EMT can be liable if an injury occurred, the EMT\nwas in control, and injuries don't generally occur without negligence [108].\nnegligence per se applies when conduct violates a statute, like an EMT\nperforming an ALS skill outside their scope that causes injury [108].\ntorts are civil wrongs, such as defamation or invasion of privacy [109].\nabandonment is the unilateral termination of care without the patient's\nconsent or provision for continued care by a competent professional [111].\nOnce care begins, you must continue until an equally competent provider\nassumes responsibility [112].\nabandonment can occur at the scene or in the emergency department [113].\nObtain a signature on your patient record from the person accepting\ntransfer of care [113].\nAssault is unlawfully placing a person in fear of immediate bodily harm,\nincluding threatening restraint [114].\nBattery is unlawfully touching a person, including providing medical care\nwithout consent [116].\nKidnapping is seizing, confining, abducting, or carrying away by force,\nincluding transporting a patient against their will [117].\nFalse imprisonment is unauthorized confinement of a person [118].\nSerious legal problems can arise if a patient rescinds consent and is confined\n[118].\nDefamation is the communication of false information that damages a\nperson's reputation [119].\nLibel is written defamation [119].\nSlander is spoken defamation [119].\nStatements on your run report should be accurate, relevant, and factual [119].\ngood samaritan laws offer immunity for errors made in good faith when\nreasonably helping another person without expectation of compensation and\nacting within your training, provided you did not act in a grossly negligent\nmanner [119].\nGross negligence is willful or reckless disregard for a duty or standard of\ncare [120].\nImmunity statutes may apply to EMS systems that are not governmental\nagencies [121].\nsovereign immunity limits liabilities for governmental entities [121].\n6. Documentation and Reporting Requirements\nCompile complete and accurate records of all incidents [121].\nRecords are an important safeguard against legal complications [121].\nIf an action was not recorded, the court may perceive it as not performed\n[122].\nIncomplete or untidy reports suggest incomplete and inexpert care [122].\nnemsis is the National EMS Information System [123].\nnemsis allows for the collection, storage, and sharing of standardized EMS\ndata [124].\nSome states have special mandatory reporting requirements for healthcare\nproviders [125].\nMandatory reporting requirements may vary by state [126].\nThese include reporting child abuse, elder abuse, and abuse of at-risk\nadults [127].\nOther mandatory reports include injuries during a felony, drug-related\ninjuries, childbirth, attempted suicides, dog bites, certain communicable\ndiseases, assaults, and domestic violence [128].\nReporting is also mandatory for sexual assault/rape, exposures to\ninfectious diseases, transport of patients in restraints, crime scenes, and\nthe deceased [130].\n7. Ethical Responsibilities and the EMT in Court\nEMTs have ethical responsibilities as healthcare providers [131].\nEthics is a philosophy of right and wrong, moral duties, and ideal\nprofessional behavior [132].\nMorality is a code of conduct affecting character, conduct, and\nconsequence [133].\nbioethics addresses ethical issues in healthcare practice [133].\nEMTs will face ethical dilemmas requiring evaluation and application of\nethical standards [134].\nApplied ethics is how ethical principles are incorporated into professional\nconduct [135].\nAllow rules, laws, and policies to guide your decision-making [135].\nEMTs can be involved in court as a witness or a defendant [136].\nCases can be civil or criminal [136].\nIf subpoenaed, immediately notify your service director and legal counsel\n[137].\nAs a witness, remain neutral and review the run report beforehand [138].\nAs a defendant, an attorney is required, often supplied by your service [139].\nIn a civil suit, defenses may include statutes of limitations, governmental\nimmunity, and contributory negligence [140].\nStatutes of limitations are the time frame for starting a case [140].\nGovernmental immunity may protect municipalities or entities from\nlawsuits or limit monetary judgments [140].\nContributory negligence is when the plaintiff's conduct contributed to\ntheir injuries [142].\nDiscovery is when both sides obtain information, including depositions (oral\nquestions) and interrogatories (written questions) [143].\nMost cases are settled after discovery and do not go to trial [146].\nIf a case goes to trial, damages can be awarded [147].\nCompensatory damages compensate the plaintiff for injuries [148].\nPunitive damages deter the defendant from repeating behavior and are\nfor reckless or intentional actions [149].\nIf a judgment is against you, your service or insurance carrier usually pays\n[151].\nAn EMT charged with a criminal offense should immediately get an\nexperienced criminal attorney [152].",
