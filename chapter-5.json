Introduction to Medical Terminology\nEffective communication and documentation in healthcare rely on a strong\nknowledge of medical terminology [6].\nUnderstanding medical terms, symbols, and abbreviations is crucial for EMTs\n[6].\nKnowing medical jargon helps in communicating with EMS, healthcare, and\npublic safety teams [8].\nThe purpose of medical terminology is to use foundational and anatomical\nterms for communication [2].\nYou can define unknown words by understanding term formation and\ncomponent definitions [7].\nComponent Description\nWord Root Foundation of the word [12]\nPrefix Occurs before the word root [14]\nSuffix Occurs after the word root [16]\nCombining Vowels Vowels that join word roots or other components [17]\n2. Anatomy of Medical Terms: Word Roots, Prefixes, and Suffixes\nA word root is the main part or stem of a word [25].\nIt conveys the essential meaning and often indicates a body part [27].\nMost terms have at least one word root [28].\nA prefix appears at the beginning of a term [32].\nprefixes usually describe location or intensity [33].\nThey give the word root its specific meaning [34].\nsuffixes are placed at the end of words [36].\nsuffixes usually indicate a procedure, condition, disease, or part of speech [37]\n.\nAccurate spelling is essential in medical terminology [19].\nFor instance, \"-phasia\" means speaking, but \"-phagia\" means eating or\nswallowing [20].\nAdding \"dys-\" (difficult/painful) to \"-phasia\" makes \"dysphasia\" (difficulty\nspeaking) [21].\nAdding \"dys-\" to \"-phagia\" makes \"dysphagia\" (difficulty eating or\nswallowing) [21].\n3. Combining Vowels and Word Building Rules\nA combining vowel connects a word root to a suffix or another word root [39].\nThe combining vowel helps ease pronunciation [40].\nIn most cases, the combining vowel is \"o\" [40].\nIt can also be \"i\" or \"e\" when joining a suffix starting with a consonant [40].\nA combining form is the combining vowel shown with the root word [41].\nRule Application\nPrefix is always at the beginning [42] Example: \"dys-\" in dysuria [91]\nSuffix is always at the end [42] Example: \"-pathy\" in nephropathy\n[88]\nUse a combining vowel when a suffix begins\nwith a consonant [43]\nMakes pronunciation easier [43]\nUse a combining vowel between two word\nroots [43]\nEven if the second root begins\nwith a vowel [43]\n4. Plural Endings and Special Word Parts\nChanging a singular term to plural follows specific rules [45].\nSometimes, you can simply add an \"s\" [45].\nMore complicated rules exist for other endings [45].\nSingular Ending Plural Ending Example\n-a -ae\n[46]\n-is -es\n[47]\n-ex or -ix -ices\n[48]\n-in, -im, -um -a\n[48]\n-us -i Bronchus becomes bronchi [48]\nprefixes can indicate numbers, colors, positions, or directions [49].\nprefixes for numbers include uni, dipli, null, primi, multi, or bi [50].\nword roots for colors include cyano, leuco, uro, cyro, or melano [51].\nprefixes for positions or directions include ab, add, d, circum, preemie, trans,\nepi, or supra [52].\n5. Directional and Movement Terms\ndirectional terms are needed to discuss the specific location of an injury [53].\nThey can also describe how pain radiates [53].\nsuperior means towards the head [56].\ninferior means towards the feet [56].\nlateral is away from the midline [57].\nmedial is towards the midline [57].\nproximal is towards the trunk of the body [59].\ndistal is away from the trunk or nearer to the free end of an extremity [59].\nSuperficial is closer to or on the skin [60].\nDeep is farther inside the body or tissue [60].\nventral refers to the belly side or anterior surface [61].\ndorsal refers to the spinal side or posterior surface [61].\npalmar is the front region or palm of the hand [62].\nPlantar is the sole of the foot [62].\napex is the tip of any structure [62].\nflexion is bending a joint [73].\nextension is straightening a joint [73].\nadduction is moving a body part towards the midline [74].\nabduction is moving a body part away from the midline [74].\nBilateral means appearing on both sides of the midline [76].\nUnilateral means appearing on only one side of the body [78].\n6. Patient Positions\nPosition Description\nProne Patient is lying face down [80]\nSupine Patient is lying face up [81]\nFowler's Semi-reclining with head elevated [83]\nSemi-Fowler's Patient sits with back at a 45-degree angle [84]\nHigh Fowler's Patient is sitting at a 90-degree angle [85]\n7. Breaking Down Medical Terms: Examples\nYou can understand terms by breaking them into parts [87].\nNephropathy has three parts [87].\n\"-pathy\" is the suffix meaning disease [88].\n\"o\" is the combining form [89].\n\"nephra\" is the word root meaning kidney [89].\nNephropathy means disease of the kidney [90].\ndysuria can be broken down [91].\n\"-ia\" is the suffix meaning a condition of [91].\n\"dys-\" is the prefix meaning difficult, painful, or abnormal [92].\n\"ur\" is the word root meaning urine [94].\ndysuria means painful urination [94].\nhyperemesis has a prefix and a word root [95].\n\"hyper-\" is the prefix meaning excessive [96].\n\"emesis\" is the word root meaning vomiting [97].\nhyperemesis means excessive vomiting [97].\nanalgesic has a suffix, prefix, and word root [99].\n\"-ic\" is the suffix meaning pertaining to [99].\n\"an-\" is the prefix meaning without or absent of [99].\nThe word root refers to pain [99].\nanalgesic means pertaining to no pain [99].\n8. Medical Abbreviations, Acronyms, and Symbols\nMedical abbreviations, acronyms, and symbols are used as shorthand for\ncommunication [100].\nThey allow for faster communication [100].\nOnly commonly understood abbreviations should be used [100].\nThis minimizes misinterpretations and errors [100].\nThe Joint Commission and Institute of Safe Medicine Practices are authorities\non abbreviations [101].\nThey provide \"do not use\" lists [101].\nAn acronym shortens several words, usually using the first letter of each [102].\nIt forms a shorter term pronounced as its own word [103].\nBe familiar with accepted uses in your local jurisdiction [103].\nOnly widely understood and accepted symbols should be used [103].\nType Description\nAbbreviations Shorthand for faster communication [100]\nAcronyms Shortened terms using initial letters, pronounced as a word [102]\nSymbols Shorthand for communication [100]\n9. Review of Key Concepts\nThe word root conveys the essential meaning of a medical term [104].\nprefixes indicate colors, numbers, positions, and directions [105].\nThe plural form of \"bronchus\" is \"bronchi\" [106].\nBeing superior to something means being closer to the head [107].\nMovement of an arm towards the midline is called adduction [108].\nA body part closer to the midline is medial [109].\nventral identifies a body part on the belly side or anterior surface [110].\nThe semi-fowler position means the patient is sitting at a 45-degree angle\n[110].\nA laceration on the plantar surface is on the sole of the foot [111].\nWhen using abbreviations, EMTs should use those in their agency, use only\nmedically accepted ones, and use them to shorten documentation [111].",
